More Anti-US Protests Over Anti-Muslim Film

New protests erupted across the Muslim world Friday, where anger is spreading over an anti-Islamic video posted on the Internet.

The most recent protests broke out in Tunisia's capital of Tunis, where police fired tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators, some of whom were amble to jump over the wall surrounding the U.S. embassy.

The violence also spread to Sudan, where witnesses said police clashed with thousands of protesters heading toward the U.S. embassy. Protesters are also reported to have breached the German embassy.

Friday was the fourth day of protests over the film, which was a topic of conversation at Friday prayers across the Middle East, south and east Asia and Africa. Many demonstrators have been targeting countries they feel have not done enough to stop the video from being made.

U.S. and other foreign missions stepped up security following violent attacks that began Tuesday.

Some of the biggest demonstrations have taken place in Cairo, where protesters near the U.S. embassy Friday were met by police, who responded by firing with tear gas.

Protests have also taken place in Malaysia and Indonesia and security was tight in Kabul, Afghanistan.

In Benghazi, Libya, where the U.S. ambassador and three other American personnel were killed in an attack Tuesday, security was stepped up around the city and the airport temporarily closed.

U.S. warships are headed to the Libyan coast, while additional U.S. marine guards were deployed to protect the American embassy in Yemen, breached by protesters Thursday.

Libyan officials said Thursday that they have arrested four people in connection with this week's assault on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi that killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three of his staff. The officials did not provide details.

American intelligence agencies are examining the alleged involvement of pro-al-Qaida militants. But they say they do not have solid evidence.

Japan: Chinese Patrol Ships Leave Disputed Waters

All six Chinese surveillance ships have left Japanese-controlled waters after briefly conducting a patrol mission near a group of disputed islands.

Japan's Coast Guard say the ships left the area surrounding the uninhabited archipelago Friday after both sides exchanged warnings in the contested waters.

Japan had organized an emergency task force and summoned the Chinese ambassador in response to the move, which it called "regrettable" and "unprecedented."

Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hong Lei said the "routine law enforcement" mission was "completely justifiable," saying the current tensions between Tokyo and Beijing are "completely caused by Japan."

China's official Xinhua news agency said the mission dealt "a big blow to the inflated swagger of Japan."

Tensions surrounding the rocky islets, known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China, have heightened since Tokyo angered China by purchasing them this week from a private Japanese landowner.

China's vice commerce minister, Jiang Zengwei, warned Thursday the dispute could affect trade between China and Japan, while Japanese Foreign Minister Koichiro Gemba called for calm.

China is Japan’s largest trading partner.
