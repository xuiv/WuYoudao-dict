**韩国法院就苹果vs三星讼案做出裁决**

一家韩国法院做出裁决，判定美国技术巨头苹果公司与其韩国竞争对手三星公司相互侵犯了对方的移动电话设计专利权。

首尔法院星期五说，苹果侵犯了三星的两项无线专利权，而三星侵犯了苹果的一项设计专利权。法院判定这两家公司彼此做出小额赔偿，并对两家公司在韩国销售本公司产品做出轻微限制。

值得注意的是，这家法院判定三星没有抄袭苹果的iPhone设计。三星是世界上最大的手机制造商。

苹果和三星在全球范围内进行着一场涉及巨额金钱的法律较量，上述讼案是其组成部分，预计一家美国法院不久将做出一项重大裁决。

**The Seoul court ruled on Apple VS Samsung case**

A South Korean court has ruled that U.S. technology giant Apple and its South Korean rival Samsung Electronics have infringed each other's patents for mobile devices.

The Seoul court said Friday that Apple infringed on two Samsung wireless patents, while Samsung violated one of Apple's design patents. It awarded small damages to each side and imposed a limited ban on the sale of each company's products in South Korea.

Notably, the court said that Samsung, now the world's largest mobile phone maker, did not copy the design of Apple's popular iPhone.

The case is part of a multibillion dollar global legal battle between the two technology powerhouses, and sets the stage for a major verdict expected to soon be delivered in a U.S. court.

**希腊总理要求更多时间来实行改革和削减开支**
美国之音 华盛顿报道

预计希腊总理萨马拉斯星期五在柏林会晤德国总理默克尔时，将要求给予希腊更多时间来施行重要改革和削减开支，争取让陷于经济衰退的希腊留在欧元区。

萨马拉斯本星期早些时候对德国报纸说，希腊并不寻求从其国际债权人那里得到更多贷款。他表示，希腊只希望得到更多一点时间来削减开支并实行改革，以振兴经济和增加收入。

但德国财政部长朔伊布勒本星期对德国广播电台说，更多时间就意味着更多金钱。

星期六，萨马拉斯将前往巴黎，会晤法国总统奥朗德。


** Greek PM Seeks More Time to Make Reforms, Cuts**

Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras is expected to ask for more time to make key reforms and spending cuts to keep his recession-plagued country in the eurozone when he meets Friday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin.

Mr. Samaras told the German newspaper Bild earlier this week that Greece is not seeking more money from its international creditors. He said Greece only wants a little more time to make spending cuts and reforms that would revive its economy and boost income.

However, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told German radio this week that more time would mean more money.

Mr. Samaras will take his diplomatic bid to Paris on Saturday for a meeting with French President Francois Hollande.
