**Morsi Supporters Rally After Court Rules Against Parliament Recall**

Thousands of Egyptians have rallied in support of President Mohamed Morsi after the country's highest court overruled his decision to recall parliament.

The demonstrators chanted and waved flags late Tuesday in Cairo's Tahrir Square.

The court earlier ruled against Mr. Morsi's decision to recall the Islamist-led parliament, which the nation's military leaders dissolved last month after the Supreme Constitutional Court found fault with the process by which lawmakers were elected.

**Japan Protests Chinese Ships Near Disputed Islands**

Japan has lodged a protest with China after three Chinese patrol ships entered waters near a set of disputed islands in the East China Sea.

Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura told reporters Wednesday that the islands are "inherently" Japanese territory.

China, which also claims ownership, says the three vessels were fishery patrol ships conducting routine sweeps of the East China Sea.

The uninhabited islands known as Senkaku in Japanese and Diaoyo in Chinese are a frequent flashpoint between Tokyo and Beijing. They are located in a gas-rich area and surrounded by rich fishing grounds.
