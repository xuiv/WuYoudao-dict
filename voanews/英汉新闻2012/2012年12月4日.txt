**诺贝尔奖得主敦促习近平释放刘晓波**

世界各国的100多位诺贝尔奖得主敦促即将担任中国国家主席的习近平释放被监禁的中国异议人士、诺贝尔和平奖得主刘晓波。

134位诺贝尔奖得主星期二联名致信习近平，敦促他“立即无条件释放”刘晓波。刘晓波被判犯有煽动颠覆国家政权罪，目前正在服11年的刑期。这些诺贝尔奖得主还呼吁解除对刘晓波妻子刘霞的软禁。刘晓波2010年获诺贝尔和平奖后，刘霞遭到软禁。

包括图图大主教和达赖喇嘛在内的这些诺贝尔奖得主说，释放刘晓波和他的妻子将是朝着尊重中国公民的基本权利迈出的“具有实质性的第一步”。他们警告说，任何政府如果限制思想自由和结社自由，都会阻碍本国的发展。

中国当局2009年判处刘晓波11年监禁，他因参与撰写“08宪章”而被控犯有煽动颠覆国家政权罪。“08宪章”是一份宣言，呼吁共产党统治的中国实行政治改革和给予公民更多权利。

**Nobel Laureates Urge China to Release Imprisoned Peace Prize Winner**

More than 100 Nobel laureates from around the globe are urging China's incoming President Xi Jinping to free imprisoned Chinese dissident and Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo.

The group of 134 Nobel winners sent a letter to Xi Tuesday, asking him to "immediately and unconditionally release" Liu, who is serving an 11-year prison sentence for "inciting subversion." They also want his wife Liu Xia to be released from house arrest she was placed under after her husband won the award in 2010.

The group, which includes Archbishop Desmond Tutu and the Dalai Lama, said the release of Liu and his wife would be an "essential first step" toward embracing the fundamental rights of Chinese citizens. The Nobel laureates warned that no government can restrict freedom of thought and association without hindering its development.

Chinese authorities sentenced Liu Xiaobo to 11 years in prison in 2009 on subversion charges related to his co-authoring of "Charter 08," a manifesto calling for political reforms and greater rights in Communist-ruled China.
