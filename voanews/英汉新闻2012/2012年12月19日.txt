**South Korea Elects 1st Woman President, Dictator Park's Daughter **

Park Geun-hye has won Wednesday's presidential election in South Korea and will become the country's first female head of state.

Her rival, Moon Jae-in, conceded the race shortly after the National Election Commission was quoted as saying the conservative Ms. Park was a certain winner.

Ms. Park, 60 years old, is a five-term lawmaker and a daughter of former South Korean dictator Park Chung-hee.

She ran a tight race against her liberal rival, a human-rights lawyer who was once jailed under the administration run by Ms. Park's father.

Despite frigid winter weather Wednesday, voters bundled up and turned out in long lines across the country, surpassing the turnout of the previous two presidential elections.

**报告：美驻班加西使团未获得足够保安**

一个调查9月11日利比亚攻击事件的独立小组作出的调查结论是，由于美国驻班加西领事馆获得的安全保障“极为不足”,在那起攻击事件中，造成4名美国人丧生。

问责审查委员会说，美国国务院中两个部门的高层“系统性的疏失与管理的缺失”导致了无法应对班加西领事馆遭攻击的保安态势。

该委员会在星期二晚间发布的报告中还说，尽管驻利比亚外交官不断提出增加保安人员的要求，但在攻击发生的当天，在班加西的外交保安人员的人数仍然不足。

报告提出一些建议，其中包括为在高风险地区的临时设施制定最低保安标准。

美国国务卿克林顿星期二表示接受调查小组的报告。克林顿在一封给美国议员的信中说，她正在努力改善外交设施的保安。

4名美国人在班加西的袭击中丧生，其中包括克里斯多佛.史蒂文森大使。这是自1988年以来的首起谋杀美国大使事件。

** Report: Inadequate Security at US Mission in Benghazi**

An independent U.S. panel investigating the September 11 attack in Libya that resulted in the deaths of four Americans has concluded that security at the Benghazi mission was "grossly inadequate."

The Accountability Review Board says senior-level "systematic failures and management deficiencies" within two State Department bureaus led to a security posture that was inadequate to deal with the attack at the site.

In a report released late Tuesday, the board also said the number of diplomatic security staff members in Benghazi on the day of the attack was "inadequate," in spite of repeated requests from diplomats in Libya for additional staffing.

The board made a number of recommendations, including developing minimum security standards for temporary facilities in high-risk areas.

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Tuesday that she accepted the panel's findings. In a letter to U.S. lawmakers, Clinton said she was working to improve security at diplomatic facilities.

The four Americans killed in the attack included Ambassador Christopher Stephens, in what was the first murder of a U.S. ambassador since 1988.
