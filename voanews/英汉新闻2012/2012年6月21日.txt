**中国国家媒体：民主不能解决缅甸的所有问题**

中国国家媒体警告说，缅甸的民主改革不可过激和匆忙，并声称单靠民主不能解决东南亚这个国家所有的问题。

中国共产党属下的环球时报发表评论文章，承认缅甸这个新的准文官政府近来实行的改革为缅甸带来了前所未有的希望。但这篇文章警告缅甸说，缅甸面临着所谓“西方式民主”的危险，声称实行改革太过匆忙可能为各类极端分子提供机会。

环球时报的文章特别提到近来缅甸西部佛教徒与基督徒之间爆发的冲突。那场冲突造成数十人死亡，几万人流离失所。这篇文章说，如果缅甸受西方影响太严重或过度依赖西方的政府模式，此类冲突就可能愈演愈烈，失去控制。

** Chinese State Media: Democracy No 'Panacea' for Burma**


Chinese state media are warning against "excessive and hasty" democratic change in Burma, saying democracy alone cannot solve all of the Southeast Asian country's problems.

A commentary in the Communist Party-run Global Times acknowledged that the recent reforms by Burma's new quasi-civilian government are bringing "unprecedented hope for the nation's prospects."But it also warned Burma of the dangers of what it called "Western-style democracy," saying too hasty of reform could "provide chances for all kinds of extremists."

In particular, it mentioned the recent conflict between Buddhists and Muslims in western Burma that has left dozens dead and tens of thousands displaced.
The article said such conflicts "may get worse and run out of control" if Burma is too heavily influenced by the West or excessively relies on Western models of government.

**埃及推迟宣布总统决选最终结果**


埃及选举委员会说，目前正在审查来自两位总统候选人的申诉，而且有关选举舞弊的投诉急剧增多，局势非常紧张，因此决定推迟星期四宣布总统决选最终结果的计划。

埃及选举委员会星期三表示，法官们正在审查有关竞选违规的大约400桩投诉以及穆斯林兄弟会候选人穆尔西及其对手、前总理沙菲克分别提交的点票结果。

选举委员会尚未决定宣布总统决选获胜者的日期。

就在总统决选使埃及局势变得具有爆炸性之际，现年84岁的前总统穆巴拉克健康状况恶化，更增加了埃及局势的不确定性。

埃及国家媒体报道说，穆巴拉克突患中风，已经濒临死亡，目前靠呼吸机维持生命。穆巴拉克已从开罗监狱医院转至一家军医院。

埃及安全官员星期三说，穆巴拉克处于昏迷状态，但已经脱离生命维持系统，心脏和其他主要器官都有功能。纽约时报援引穆巴拉克的一位律师的话说，穆巴拉克只是在监狱卫生间内跌倒。


** Egypt Presidential Election Results Delayed**

Egypt's Election Commission says it has delayed Thursday's planned announcement of the results of a runoff presidential vote while it continues to review appeals from the two candidates, hiking tension as allegations of fraud mounted.

The commission said Wednesday that judges are still looking into some 400 complaints of alleged campaign violations and disputed vote counting submitted by Mohammed Morsi, the Muslim Brotherhood candidate, and his rival, former prime minister Ahmed Shafiq.

No new date to announce a winner was given.

On top of the potentially explosive election dispute looms renewed uncertainty over the latest health scare of 84-year-old former President Hosni Mubarak.

The state news agency reported that Mubarak was near death and put on a respirator after suffering a stroke. He was transferred to a military hospital from the Cairo prison hospital.

Security officials said Wednesday the ousted leader was in a coma and off life support and that his heart and other vital organs were functioning. A later report in The New York Times quoted a lawyer for the ex-leader as saying Mubarak had only fallen down in the prison bathroom.shuangyu
