**朝鲜发射远程火箭 声称卫星进入轨道**

朝鲜说，已经成功发射一枚远程火箭，并将一颗卫星送入轨道。朝鲜不顾国际社会的警告发射了火箭。

朝鲜官方中央通讯社星期三上午报道这一消息后，朝鲜国营电视台的一名主持人高兴地宣布了这一消息。

北美空防司令部说，最初迹象显示，朝鲜导弹成功发射了一个物体，这个物体“看起来被送入轨道”。

韩国国防部和日本防卫厅的官员都证实说，三级火箭看起来全部按照计划分离。但是他们不能立即说，物体是否已经被送入轨道。

白宫发表声明，将朝鲜的发射称为是“威胁地区安全的高度挑衅行为”，违反了联合国安全理事会禁止平壤进行弹道导弹活动的决议。

联合国秘书长潘基文也谴责朝鲜的发射是对联合国决议的“明显违背”，并说他关注发射给该地区的和平与稳定带来的后果。

** North Korea Launches Long-Range Rocket, Claims Satellite in Orbit **

North Korea says it has succeeded in launching a long-range rocket and placing a satellite into orbit, defying international warnings.

The official Korean Central News Agency reported the news early Wednesday and it was later announced triumphantly by an anchor on North Korean state television.

The North American Aerospace Defense Command ((NORAD)) says initial indications suggest the missile launch was successful in deploying an object that "appeared to achieve orbit."

South Korean and Japanese defense officials confirmed that all three stages of the rocket appear to have separated as scheduled. But they could not immediately say whether the device had been placed into orbit.

The White House issued a statement calling the launch a "highly provocative act that threatens regional security" and violates U.N. Security Council resolutions barring ballistic missile activity by Pyongyang.

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also deplored the launch as a "clear violation" of U.N. sanctions, saying he is concerned about its consequences on peace and stability in the region.

**奥巴马：美国现在承认新成立的叙利亚反对派联盟**

美国总统奥巴马说，美国现在承认新成立的叙利亚反对派联盟，这一举措是向身处困境的叙利亚总统阿萨德施压。

奥巴马总统星期二在美国电视台上说，新的联盟现在代表了足够多的叙利亚人口，可以被视为“合法代表”反对阿萨德政权的叙利亚人民。

这一被广泛预期的举措旨在加强那些寻求推翻阿萨德政府的反叛组织的力量。但讲话没有提到美国对反对派提供武器的任何承诺。美国政府说，反对派中有恐怖分子的参与。

奥巴马总统在接受美国广播公司的采访中指出，在反对派联盟中有“少数分子”与伊拉克基地组织“有牵连”，我们已经将“叙利亚人民胜利阵线支持者”定性为恐怖组织。

在那几个小时前，美国国务院正式宣布“叙利亚人民胜利阵线支持者”为恐怖组织，该组织的资产由于这一定性被冻结。美国国务院还宣布，对两个支持叙利亚总统的武装民兵组织实行制裁。

分析人士说，在与叙利亚阿萨德政府作战中，“叙利亚人民胜利阵线支持者”是最有效率的反叛组织之一。该组织的效率引起了美国关注，由于强硬派的极端分子正在指挥为期21个月的反叛活动。

**Obama: US Now Recognizes New Syrian Opposition Coalition **

U.S. President Barack Obama says the United States now recognizes a newly-formed Syrian coalition of opposition groups -- a move aimed at piling pressure against embattled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

Mr. Obama, speaking Tuesday on U.S. television, said the new coalition is now representative enough of the Syrian population that it can be seen as the "legitimate representative" of the Syrian people "in opposition to the Assad regime."

The widely-expected move is aimed at strengthening the hand of rebels seeking to topple the Assad government. But it stops short of any U.S. commitment to arm the opposition, which the administration says includes terrorist participation.

In the ABC television interview, the president noted a "small element" within the opposition coalition that is, in his words, " affiliated with al-Qaida in Iraq, and we have designated them, al-Nusra, as a terrorist organization."

Hours earlier, the U.S. State Department formally declared Jabhat al-Nusra a terrorist organization -- a move that freezes its assets. It also announced sanctions against two armed militia groups that back the Syrian president.

Analysts say al-Nusra has been among the most effective of the rebel groups fighting the Assad government. That effectiveness has raised U.S. concerns that hardline extremists are commandeering the 21-month-old revolt.
