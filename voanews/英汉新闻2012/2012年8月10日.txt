**利比亚国民议会推选梅加里夫担任总统**

利比亚的新国民议会推选前反对派领袖穆罕默德·埃尔·梅加里夫担任总统。

在共有200个议席的国民议会的表决中，梅加里夫获得113票，击败独立人士齐丹。齐丹获得85票。

在利比亚国民议会星期四晚间表决的一天前，利比亚过渡委员会将权力转交国民议会。利比亚上个月举行了60年来的首次自由选举，国民议会由此产生。

梅加里夫是利比亚成立最早的反对派组织拯救利比亚全国阵线的领袖，该组织曾数次试图结束卡扎菲的42年统治。

梅加里夫自上世纪80年代以来长期流亡国外，去年爆发反抗卡扎菲的革命后，他返回利比亚。

梅加里夫现在是全国阵线党领袖。利比亚新宪法草拟完毕后，梅加里夫将负责筹备举行议会全面选举。

** Libyan Assembly Elects Gadhafi Opponent as President **


Libya's new national assembly has elected former opposition leader Mohammed el-Megarif as its president.

Mr. Megarif received 113 votes from the 200-member Congress, defeating independent Ali Zidan, who won 85.

The vote late Thursday came just one day after Libya's transitional council handed power to the assembly, which was elected last month in the nation's first free election in 60 years.

Mr. Megarif was the leader of Libya's oldest opposition movement, the National Front for the Salvation of Libya, which tried several times to end the 42-year rule of late leader Moammar Gadhafi.

After living in exile since the 1980s, Mr. Megarif returned to Libya following the revolution last year that ousted Gadhafi.

Mr. Megarif, now head of the National Front party, will steer the nation to full parliamentary elections after a new constitution is drafted.

**中国7月份贸易额同比增幅大减**

中国7月份出口额比去年同期仅增长1%，显示最近中国经济在世界经济的影响下增速减缓。

中国海关总署星期五发布的这一数据大大低于6月份11.3%的同比增幅，也远低于很多经济学家的预测。中国7月份的进口额同比增长仅为4.7%，低于6月份的6.3%。经济学家曾经预测至少增长7%。

中国7月份的贸易顺差为251亿美元，低于去年同期的315亿美元。北京为今年设定的贸易总额增幅为10%。

这些贸易数据可能促使中国领导人采取更有力的措施来刺激经济增长。中国政府今年已经两次降低利率，并开始对一系列公共设施项目投放资金。

** China's Trade Growth Falters in July**

China's exports grew just one percent in July compared to the same period a year earlier, the latest sign of continued stagnation within the global economy.

The figures released Friday by China's customs bureau were far below the 11.3 percent rate posted in June, and well short of many economists' forecasts. Imports in July were also weak, rising just 4.7 percent from a year earlier compared to the 6.3 percent mark posted in June. Economists had forecast an increase of at least 7 percent.

China's trade surplus in July was $25.1 billion, down from $31.5 billion a year earlier. Beijing has set a goal of 10 percent growth in total trade this year.

These trade figures may prompt Chinese leaders to take more aggressive actions to stimulate the economy growth. The government has already cut interest rates twice this year and begun spending on a number of public works projects.
