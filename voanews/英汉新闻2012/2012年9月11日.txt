**美国纪念9-11恐怖袭击11周年**

美国总统奥巴马和夫人米歇尔星期二将在白宫草坪带领民众默哀，纪念纽约和华盛顿遭受基地组织恐怖袭击11周年。

奥巴马夫妇将在两架民航班机中的第一架撞击纽约世贸中心的那一时刻开始默哀仪式，然后将在五角大楼带领举行一次类似的仪式。五角大楼是美国军方总部所在地，在2001年恐怖袭击中遭受第三架班机的撞击。

就像以往一些年那样，世贸中心死难者亲属将参加在世贸中心遗址举行的念诵死难者姓名仪式。但与以往不同的是，民选官员将不参加在世贸中心举行的仪式。

美国副总统拜登将在宾夕法尼亚州尚克斯维尔举行的仪式上发表演讲。第四架被劫持班机上的乘客们试图控制飞机，避免华盛顿的另一个可能的目标遭到撞击，结果这架班机在尚克斯维尔坠毁。

** Americans Observe 11th Anniversary of 9/11**

U.S. President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle will lead a moment of silence on the White House lawn Tuesday to mark the 11th anniversary of the al Qaida terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, D.C.

The Obamas will observe the event at the moment the first of two jetliners struck the World Trade Center in New York City, then will lead a similar ceremony at the memorial at the Pentagon, the headquarters of the U.S. military that was struck by a third plane in the 2001 attacks.

As in past years, the families of those killed at the World Trade Center will take part in a ritual reading of the victim's names at Ground Zero. But in a departure from previous observances, no elected official will take part in the Ground Zero ceremonies.

Vice President Joe Biden will speak at a ceremony in Shanksville, Pennsylvania where a fourth hijacked jetliner crashed after passengers tried to take control of the plane, preventing it from possibly reaching another target in Washington.

**习近平一周内三次未按计划会晤到访外国政要**

中国国家副主席习近平一星期来接连三次未能按照日程安排会晤到访的外国政要，在中国领导人准备权力过渡之际，这一情况引起了许多有关习近平健康状况的猜测。

中国外交部上星期说，习近平星期一将在北京会晤丹麦首相施密特，但这一会晤没有进行。

人们广泛预计，在定于今年晚些时候召开的中共党代会上，习近平在10年一度的中国领导层换届中将成为下任中国国家主席。

按照日程安排，习近平应于上星期三会晤到访的美国国务卿希拉里•克林顿和新加坡总理李显龙，但这两次会晤都被取消。

中国外交部说，取消会晤是由于日程冲突，但没有加以具体说明。

** Chinese Vice President Fails to Greet Visiting Dignitary for 3rd Time in Week**

Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping has failed to appear for a meeting with a visiting foreign dignitary for the third time in a week, fueling speculation about his health as Chinese leaders prepare for a transition of power.

China's foreign ministry said last week Xi would meet Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt in Beijing Monday, but that meeting did not happen.

Xi is widely expected to become China's next president as part of a once-in-a-decade leadership transition that begins with a Communist Party congress later this year.

He was scheduled to hold talks with visiting U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong last Wednesday, but those meetings were called off.

China's foreign ministry attributed the cancelations to an "itinerary adjustment," but it did not elaborate.
