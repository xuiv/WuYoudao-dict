**人权观察敦促中国保护缅甸难民**

人权观察组织说，中国以强制方式遣返一些逃离缅甸战火的克钦族难民。

人权观察说，中国当局已将大约300名难民遣返缅甸克钦邦。去年，缅甸政府军和克钦族反政府武装分子在克钦邦爆发激战。

人权观察的报告说，多达一万名克钦族难民逃到中国的云南省，目前他们急需人道援助。

人权观察说，中国“基本上容忍”来自克钦邦的难民，但缺乏足够的水、粮食和其他基本物资。人权观察表示，克钦族难民经常受到当地政府的骚扰，并被中国雇主剥削。

人权观察敦促中国政府为克钦族难民提供临时保护，并允许人道援助机构不受阻碍地接触这些难民。人权观察还呼吁北京遵守国际条约，不要强行遣返难民。

**Rights Group Urges China to Protect Burmese Refugees**

Human Rights Watch says China has been forcibly returning some of the ethnic-Kachin refugees who fled fighting in Burma.

The group says Chinese authorities have repatriated about 300 refugees to Kachin state, where heavy fighting broke out last year between the Burmese army and Kachin rebels.

The report says as many as 10,000 Kachin people have fled the conflict for China's southern Yunnan province, where they are in desperate need of humanitarian aid.

Human Rights Watch says China has "generally tolerated" refugees from Kachin, but says they lack adequate water, food and other basic supplies. It also said Kachin people are routinely harassed by local authorities and exploited by Chinese employers.

The group is urging China to provide temporary protection and allow humanitarian agencies "unhindered access" to the refugees. It also wants Beijing to adhere to international treaties that prohibit forced returns of refugees.

**西班牙和塞浦路斯为本国银行寻求救助**

西班牙和塞浦路斯分别是欧元区最大的经济体之一和最小的经济体之一，这两个国家星期一都在为陷入财务困难的本国银行寻求欧元区的援助。

西班牙为其持有不良房地产贷款的银行寻求多达1250亿美元的援助。但是西班牙外交大臣马加洛表示，救助贷款的细节还有待确定，这些细节包括贷款是由西班牙政府偿还，还是由银行偿还。

星期一晚间，评级机构穆迪将28家西班牙银行的信用等级降低了一至四个等级，理由是西班牙政府支持本国银行的能力不足。

与此同时，岛国塞浦路斯成为继希腊、爱尔兰、葡萄牙、西班牙之后第五个寻求别国经济援助的欧元区国家。塞浦路斯政府宣称需要援助以抵消银行面临的风险，但并未公布所需援助的金额。

塞浦路斯政府宣称，国内各银行由于深受邻国负债累累的希腊经济的影响而变得非常脆弱，这主要是由于他们购买了今年早些时候账面价值下调的希腊政府债券。

同时，惠誉金融服务公司成为第三个将塞浦路斯的信用等级降为“垃圾”级的评级机构。

**Spain, Cyprus Seek Bailouts for Their Ailing Banks**

Spain and Cyprus -- one of the euro currency bloc's biggest economies and one of its smallest -- both sought eurozone bailouts Monday for their financially troubled banks.

Spain asked for up to a $125 billion rescue for banks left holding bad real estate loans. Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Margallo said details of the bailout will be determined later, including whether the loans would have to be paid by the Spanish government or the banks alone.

Late Monday, the Moody's ratings agency downgraded the credit ratings of 28 Spanish banks between one and four notches, citing the government's ability to support the banks.

Meanwhile, the island nation of Cyprus became the fifth eurozone country looking for financial aid from others in the currency bloc, following Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain. The Cypriot government did not say how much it wants to borrow.

It says its banks are vulnerable because of their "large exposure" to the economy in nearby debt-ridden Greece. Cypriot-held Greek government bonds were written down in value earlier this year.

The Fitch ratings service became the third such firm to downgrade Cyprus' credit rating to "junk" status.
