**自杀爆炸手在阿富汗首都附近袭击外国人**

一名自杀爆炸手在阿富汗首都喀布尔附近袭击一辆外国人乘坐的面包车，造成至少12人死亡。

警方说，星期二的袭击发生在喀布尔机场附近，九名外国工作人员、一名阿富汗司机和至少另外两名阿富汗人被炸死。爆炸手在通往机场的主要公路上袭击这辆面包车。

喀布尔警方官员说，这些外国人是设在机场的一家私营公司的职员。

阿富汗叛乱组织伊斯兰党宣称对这起袭击负责，并表示爆炸手是一名女性，发动袭击是对一部反伊斯兰影片做出的反应。这部在美国制作的影片嘲弄伊斯兰教先知穆罕默德，在世界范围引发抗议，包括阿富汗。在星期一的示威中，数百抗议者在喀布尔与安全部队发生冲突。

北约星期二向美国之音证实，由于近来发生一系列内部袭击事件以及网上出现反伊斯兰教影片的片段，北约正在减少与阿富汗安全部队的联合行动。

*Suicide Bomber Attacks Foreigners near Kabul*

A suicide bomber has attacked a mini-bus carrying foreigners near the Afghan capital, killing at least 12 people.

Police say nine foreign workers, an Afghan driver and at least two other Afghans were killed in Tuesday's blast near the Kabul airport. The bomber targeted the bus on the main highway to the airport.

A Kabul police official said the foreigners worked for a private company based at the airport.

Afghan insurgent group Hezb-e-Islami claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was carried out by a female bomber in response to an anti-Islam film. The crude American-made video mocks the Prophet Muhammad and has sparked worldwide protests, including in Afghanistan. Hundreds of protesters clashed with security forces in Kabul during Monday's demonstration.

NATO confirmed to VOA Tuesday that it is scaling back joint operations with Afghan security forces amid a series of recent insider attacks and the release of the anti-Islam video.
