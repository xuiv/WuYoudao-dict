**初步计票：涅托将赢得墨西哥总统选举**

墨西哥总统选举的初步计票结果显示，革命制度党候选人培尼亚·涅托将成为下届总统。当年长期居于统治地位的革命制度党将重新执政。

墨西哥选举官员星期日晚间说，涅托获得38%的选票，击败了前墨西哥城市长奥夫拉多尔。奥夫拉多尔获得31的选票。

奥夫拉多尔说，他还不准备承认败选。

革命制度党执政71年，直到2000年。批评人士说，革命制度党长期掌权导致腐败、选举舞弊和压制。但是，由于墨西哥在保守的国家行动党政府领导下经济凋敝、法治弛废，革命制度党近来在民众中的支持率增高。

国家行动党候选人莫塔的得票位居第三。

涅托对支持者讲话时说，墨西哥通过投票的方式选择了变革方向。他誓言要对贩毒集团施压。

Preliminary Results: Pena Nieto Wins Mexican Presidential Election

Preliminary results show voters in Mexico have chosen to bring the country's once dominant political party back into power by electing Enrique Pena Nieto as their next president.

Election officials said late Sunday that Pena Nieto had 38 percent of the vote to beat former Mexico City mayor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who had 31 percent.

Lopez Obrador said he was not ready to concede.

Pena Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party ruled Mexico for 71 years until 2000, when voters elected National Action Party (PAN) candidate Vicente Fox. Outgoing President Felipe Calderon, also from PAN, followed in 2006, but his tenure has been plagued by economic stagnation and rampant drug violence.

Mr. Calderon deployed the military to fight the drug cartels shortly after he took office. More than 50,000 people have been killed in drug violence since then.

Pena Nieto said in an address to his supporters that Mexicans have voted for a change in direction, but he vowed to keep pressure on the cartels.


**欧洲四国外长寻求控制武器交易**

英国、法国、德国和瑞典敦促联合国成员国支持对常规武器贸易进行监管的决定性努力。

来自150多个国家的代表星期一开始在纽约召开为期一个月的会议，起草全球武器贸易协定。

在这次会议开始之前，英国外交大臣黑格、法国外长法比尤斯和德国外长韦斯特韦勒在一份联合声明中说，非法武器走私活动对人类构成越来越严重的威胁。

声明表示，全世界每年都有数以百万计的人因武器交易未受到有效控制而受到危害。

签署这份声明的还有瑞典贸易大臣。声明呼吁建立一个强有力和全面的国际统一标准构架，防止正当的武器交易落入非法走私网络之中。

这些外交官员还提到，他们的国家是欧洲出口大量武器的国家，这意味着，他们的国家对确保这些武器的用途不违背人道目的或国际法负有特殊责任。

European Foreign Ministers Want 'Decisive' Effort to Regulate Arms Trade

Britain, France, Germany and Sweden are urging United Nations members to support a "decisive effort" to regulate conventional weapons trade.

Delegates from more than 150 countries are gathering in New York Monday to begin a month-long meeting to draft a global arms trade treaty.

Ahead of the conference, British Foreign Secretary William Hague, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle published a joint statement saying illicit arms trafficking poses a "growing threat to humanity."

They say each year millions of people around the world suffer the effects of poorly regulated arms trade.

The statement, also joined by Sweden's trade minister, calls for a "strong and comprehensive framework of common international standards" to prevent legitimate arms sales from being diverted to trafficking networks.

The diplomats note their countries are some of the largest arms exporters in Europe, and say that means they have a special responsibility to ensure the weapons are not used in a way that violates humanitarian aims or international law.
