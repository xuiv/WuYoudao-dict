**欧盟在布鲁塞尔举行峰会**

星期五上午，欧盟领导人在布鲁塞尔举行的峰会上经过数小时讨论后做出了这项决定。协议还决定为使用欧元的17国集团成立一个联合金融监管机构，并容许使用救助基金购买处于困境的借贷国家的债券。欧盟领导人最后还决定满足西班牙和意大利的要求，帮助降低其借贷成本。


欧洲理事会主席范龙佩在会后举行的记者会中对这项协议表示赞扬。

** EU Leaders Agree on Bank Rescue Fund, Bond Support for Italy and Spain **

Leaders of the European Union have reached an agreement to use its permanent rescue fund to directly boost struggling banks across the continent, and to seek a tighter long-term budgetary and political union.

The decision was reached early Friday morning after hours of discussions at the EU summit in Brussels. The agreement also establishes a joint banking supervisory body for the 17-nation bloc that uses the euro currency, and allows the rescue fund to buy the bonds of distressed sovereign borrowers. The last part was reached to satisfy the demands of Spain and Italy, who wanted help to ease their rising borrowing costs.

European Council President Herman van Rompuy hailed the agreement during a press briefing after the meeting.

**埃及当选总统穆尔西将在宪法法院外宣誓就职**


埃及当选总统穆尔西星期六将在宪法法院外面宣誓就职，看来穆尔西已经同意接受执政的军事委员会安排的权力移交程序。

埃及官方媒体中东通讯社星期四晚间报道说，穆尔西将于当地时间星期六上午11点在宪法法院外宣誓就任总统。

穆尔西曾经誓言在要议会宣誓就任总统。但埃及军事委员会说，由于最近解散了议会下院，穆尔西将在宪法法院外面宣誓就职。

一些观察人士说，穆尔西与军方的意见分歧可能是穆斯林兄弟会与军方权力斗争的第一阶段。

埃及中东通讯社还说，穆尔西星期五将在开罗的解放广场对民众发表讲话。


**Egypt's New President to Take Oath Before Court **


Egyptian President-Elect Mohamed Morsi will be sworn in Saturday before the nation's Constitutional Court, apparently acceding to the wishes of the ruling military council about details of the transfer of power.

Egypt's official MENA news agency reported late Thursday that Mr. Morsi will take the oath of office in front of the Constitutional Court at 11 a.m. local time Saturday.

Mr. Morsi had vowed to assume the presidency in front of parliament. But the military council said Mr. Morsi would take the oath in front of the Constitutional Court because of the recent dissolution of the lower house of parliament.

Some observers have said the disagreement could be the first phase of a prolonged power struggle between the Brotherhood and the military.

MENA also reported that Mr. Morsi will give a speech to crowds in Cairo's Tahrir Square Friday.
