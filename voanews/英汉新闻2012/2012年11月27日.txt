**埃及总统穆尔西保证将绝对权力限于主权事务**

埃及总统穆尔西对埃及的最高司法委员会的法官们保证，他将把最新给予自己的权力限制在主权事务上。

穆尔西的发言人阿里说，穆尔西星期一在和最高司法委员会举行的会议上做出这一承诺。关于穆尔西拥有绝对权力的主权事务，并没有任何定义。穆尔西在11月22号发布的政令规定，法院不得对总统的决定提出异议。

这位发言人说，穆尔西有关“主权事务”的说明并不构成对这项政令的改变。

反对派组织准备星期二在开罗解放广场举行一次民众集会，要求取消穆尔西的政令。他们谴责穆尔西试图取得如同其前任穆巴拉克那样的独裁权力。穆巴拉克2011年在深得民心的民众起义中被赶下台。

穆尔西为自己的举措进行辩护，声称这只是暂时性的措施，为了加快民主改革进程，目前的司法机构中有很多穆巴拉克任命的人员，民主改革由于法律上的挑战而推迟。穆尔西表示，他颁布的政令将维持到依照修改过的宪法选出新议会，而新宪法必须在全民公决中获得认可。

**Egypt's Morsi Pledges to Restrict Absolute Powers to 'Sovereign' Matters**

Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi has promised the country’s top judges that he will restrict his newly self-granted powers to sovereign matters.

Morsi spokesman Yasser Ali said the Islamist president made the pledge Monday during talks with the Supreme Judicial Council. There was no definition of the sovereign matters over which President Morsi will have absolute power. He granted himself that power in a November 22 decree that bars the judiciary from challenging his decisions.

The spokesman said Mr. Morsi’s clarification on the issue of "sovereign matters" does not constitute a change to the decree.

Opposition groups were preparing to hold a mass protest in Cairo's Tahrir Square on Tuesday to demand the cancellation of Mr. Morsi's decree. They accuse him of trying to assume dictatorial powers like those of his longtime predecessor Hosni Mubarak, who was ousted in a 2011 popular uprising.

Mr. Morsi has defended his move as a temporary measure to speed up democratic reforms delayed by legal challenges under a judicial system with many Mubarak-era appointees. He has said his decree will last until new parliamentary elections are held under a revised constitution that must be approved in a national referendum.

**卫星图像显示朝鲜准备试射导弹**

一家卫星图像公司说，新图像显示朝鲜导弹发射场的活动增加，朝鲜有可能在数星期内试射一枚远程导弹。

地球数据公司(DigitalGlobe)星期一发布的图像显示朝鲜西海卫星发射场的人员、卡车和其他设备的活动水平提高。

地球数据说，如果朝鲜有相关计划，就可以在未来三星期内试射一枚远程弹道导弹。该公司表示，西海发射场的活动类似朝鲜4月发射火箭之前的准备活动。

拥有核武器的朝鲜说，4月发射火箭是为了把一颗卫星送入轨道。但美国及其盟国说，这是一次掩盖的弹道导弹试射，而联合国的制裁决议禁止朝鲜试射弹道导弹。

**Satellite Images Suggest N. Korea Preparing for Missile Test**

A satellite operator says new images show increased activity at a North Korean launch site, suggesting a long-range missile test could take place in just weeks.

The image released Monday by DigitalGlobe shows an increased level of personnel, trucks and other equipment at North Korea's Sohae (West Sea) Satellite Launch Station.

DigitalGlobe says if North Korea desires, it could carry out a long-range ballistic missile test in the next three weeks. It says the activity is similar to preparations seen before North Korea's failed rocket launch in April.

Nuclear-armed North Korea said the April launch was meant to place a satellite into orbit. But the U.S. and its allies said it was a disguised ballistic missile test banned under U.N. sanctions.
