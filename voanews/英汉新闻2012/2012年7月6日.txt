**奥巴马宣布就中国对美国生产的汽车征收3关税一事向世贸组织提出了申诉**

美国总统奥巴马表示，美国政府将会继续努力，让中国为其损害美国汽车制造商的行为承担责任。

奥巴马在俄亥俄州的托莱多小镇附近做竞选演讲时表示，美国人民需要“一个公平竞争的环境”。星期四，奥巴马宣布就中国对美国生产的汽车征收30多亿美元新关税一事向世贸组织提出了申诉。

托莱多是一个大型汽车制造厂的所在地。奥巴马对听他演讲的民众说，以往美国曾经六次向世贸组织提出针对中国的申诉，都获得了成功。

奥巴马将于星期四和星期五在俄亥俄州和宾夕法尼亚州进行竞选活动，这两个州对11月的总统大选十分关键。

2008年大选中，奥巴马在这两个州都赢得了胜利，最近的民意测验显示，他在这两个州以微弱优势领先于他的共和党竞争对手罗姆尼。奥巴马意欲借助这次竞选巡访凸显他是普通民众和工薪阶层更理想的代言人并将自己与从政前就已是富商的罗姆尼进行对比。



** Obama Announces WTO Action Against China for US Car Duties**

U.S. President Barack Obama says his government will fight to hold China accountable for practices harming American automakers.

Speaking at a campaign stop near Toledo, Ohio Thursday, Mr. Obama said Americans need a "fair playing field." He announced a new complaint with the World Trade Organization on more than $3 billion in allegedly unfair Chinese duties on American-made cars.

Toledo is home to a big auto plant complex. Mr. Obama told the crowd that six previous WTO challenges to China have been successful.

Mr. Obama is spending Thursday and Friday in Ohio and Pennsylvania, two crucial states in the November general election.

He carried both in the 2008 election, and recent opinion polls show him holding a narrow lead over his Republican opponent, Mitt Romney. The president will use the campaign swing to portray himself as a champion of average, working-class Americans, and to portray Romney as a wealthy businessman before he entered politics.




**预计美国劳工部报告不会显示就业市场趋好**


美国劳工部星期五将公布今年6月份的就业市场报告，预计美国失业率仍然维持在8.2%。

但经济学家们相信，美国劳工部的报告可能显示雇主上个月增加的就业人数在九万到十万人之间，比5月份增加的六万九千人就业人数要多。

近来的报告展示出美国经济的一个发展程度不同的状态。美国供应管理协会本星期发表的两份报告显示，制造业的生产规模在6月份所有缩减，这是将近三年来首次出现这种情况，同时非制造业的经济活动在5月份小幅减少。

但是，美国劳工部星期四发布的报告显示，在截至6月30号的这个星期里，申请首次失业补助的人数减少了一万四千。同时，美国自动数据处理公司说，6月份就业人数增加17万六千。

由于欧盟目前的主权债务危机和华盛顿的政治僵持状态，美国经济复苏受到阻碍。

** No Improvement Expected in US Employment Report**

The unemployment rate in the United States is expected to remain stalled at 8.2 percent when the Labor Department releases its jobs report for June on Friday.

But economists believe the government report may show employers added anywhere between 90,000 and 100,000 jobs last month, better than the 69,000 jobs added in May.

Recent reports have presented a mixed picture for the US economy. The Institute for Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing managers, issued two separate reports this week showing manufacturing activity shrank in June, the first such decline in nearly three years, while non-manufacturing activity slightly declined in the previous month.

But the Labor Department reported Thursday that applications for first-time jobless benefits dropped by 14,000 in week ending June 30, while the payroll-processing firm ADP said that businesses added 176,000 new jobs last month.

The ongoing European sovereign debt crisis, as well as a political stalemate in Washington, has stalled the U.S. recovery from the global recession.
