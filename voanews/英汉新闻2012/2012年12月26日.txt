**财政悬崖逼近之际，奥巴马将返回华盛顿**

美国总统奥巴马将缩短在夏威夷的假期，返回华盛顿，再度与国会领袖们进行磋商，争取在年底之前就一项削减预算赤字方案达成协议。

白宫说，奥巴马将于星期三离开夏威夷，预计他将在星期四清晨返回华盛顿。

上星期初，奥巴马表示他和贝纳已经相对接近于就避免财政悬崖的妥协方案达成协议。所谓“财政悬崖”，就是从明年１月１日启动的削减５千亿美元开支以及对几乎所有美国工作人员增税。但截至上周末，由于国会议员们因圣诞度假而离开华盛顿，有关努力都没有结果。

**Obama to Return to Washington as Fiscal Cliff Looms**

U.S. President Barack Obama is cutting short his vacation in ((the Pacific state of)) Hawaii and will return to Washington to resume talks with congressional leaders aimed at reaching agreement on a deficit reduction package before the year ends.

The White House says Mr. Obama will leave Wednesday and is expected to arrive back in Washington early Thursday.

Early last week, the president said he and Republican House Speaker John Boehner were relatively close to an agreement on a compromise to avert what is being called a "fiscal cliff" -- $500 billion in mandated spending cuts and tax increases that would affect almost all American workers starting January 1. But by the end of last week, those efforts were in disarray as lawmakers fled Washington for their Christmas holiday break.

**阿富汗美国军事设施附近发生致命的爆炸**

一名自杀汽车爆炸手在阿富汗一个美国军事设施附近引爆炸药，3名平民被炸死。

塔利班宣称对这起袭击负责。星期三的这次袭击发生在一处被称做“查普曼前进行动基地”的设施附近。

2009年，一名与基地组织有联系的自杀爆炸手在该设施发动袭击，7名美国中央情报局雇员和一名约旦工人被炸死。

这个设施位于阿富汗东部城市霍斯特。霍斯特毗邻巴基斯坦边界，当地局势动荡。

目前没有关于星期三爆炸造成北约军人伤亡的报道。这次爆炸还造成7人受伤。

**Deadly Bombing Near US Facility in Afghanistan**

A suicide car bomber has detonated explosives near a U.S.-run military facility in Afghanistan, killing three civilians.

The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, which took place on Wednesday near the facility known as Forward Operating Base Chapman.

In 2009, seven ((U.S.)) Central Intelligence Agency employees and a Jordanian worker were killed at the base in a suicide bombing by an al-Qaida-linked agent.

The facility is located in the eastern city of Khost, a volatile region near the Pakistani border.

There were no reports of NATO casualties in Wednesday's blast, which also left seven people wounded.
