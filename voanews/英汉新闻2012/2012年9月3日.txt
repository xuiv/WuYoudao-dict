**美国：巴基斯坦爆炸袭击未造成美国人死亡**

美国驻伊斯兰堡大使馆否认巴基斯坦西北部星期一发生的一次致命爆炸造成美国人死亡。

巴基斯坦官员早些时候说，一名自杀汽车爆炸手在白沙瓦发动袭击，造成两名美国人死亡。白沙瓦靠近与阿富汗接壤的半自治部落区。有报道说，还有两名巴基斯坦人死于这次袭击。

这次袭击造成的死者是否超过两人，各方说法有出入。有关当局说，袭击还造成好几人受伤。

有关官员说，袭击者驾驶装满炸药的汽车撞入一辆美国政府的汽车。警方说，炸弹手的车内装有110公斤的爆炸物。

星期一的这次爆炸发生在白沙瓦市内驻有好几家外国救援组织和联合国机构的地段。

袭击者在美国汽车开出领事馆后向其撞去。

目前还没有人宣称对这起袭击事件负责。

巴基斯坦塔利班、阿富汗塔利班、基地组织以及相关激进团伙在部落地区扎根很深，他们利用巴基斯坦和阿富汗之间的边境漫长难守的特点，袭击阿富汗境内的北约和阿富汗部队。

US: No Americans Killed in Pakistan Blast

The U.S. embassy in Islamabad denies that any Americans were killed in a deadly blast Monday in northwest Pakistan.

Earlier, Pakistani officials said a suicide car bomber had killed two Americans in the explosion in the city of Peshawar, near Pakistan's semi-autonomous tribal region along the Afghan border. Some reports said two Pakistanis died.

There are conflicting reports on whether more than two people were killed in the attack, which authorities say left several people wounded.

Officials say the attacker rammed his explosive-laden vehicle into a U.S. government car. Police say the bomber's vehicle was loaded with 110 kilograms of explosives.

The explosion happened in an area of Peshawar that is home to several foreign aid organizations and the United Nations.

The bomber struck the vehicle after it left the U.S. consulate.

No one has claimed responsibility for the attack.

The Pakistani Taliban, the Afghan Taliban, al-Qaida and affiliated militant groups are entrenched in the tribal regions and take advantage of the porous border to launch attacks against NATO and Afghan forces in Afghanistan.

France: Chemical Weapons Would Bring 'Massive' Response to Syria

French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius says Western powers would have a "massive" response to any use of chemical or biological weapons by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces.

Fabius said in broadcast interviews Monday there is broad agreement about such a response, calling chemical weapons "a very big danger."

His comments come as the head of the International Red Cross travels to Syria for a three-day visit that will include meetings with Mr. Assad and other officials. The group says the talks will focus on the "rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation" in Syria and the challenges in reaching those impacted by the conflict.

Meanwhile, the new United Nations-Arab League envoy tasked with bringing a peaceful solution to the Syrian crisis says he has "no illusions" that his job will be easy.
