**利比亚国民大会选出临时政府新总理**

利比亚议员们选出一位新的临时政府总理。一星期前，利比亚议员们先前选出的临时政府总理未能组成一个可以接受的内阁，因此被投不信任票。

星期天，利比亚国民大会推选阿里·兹丹为临时政府总理。兹丹曾是职业外交官，他于上世纪80年代叛逃出国，直言不讳地批评前领导人卡扎菲。后来，兹丹成为倡导人权的活动人士。

兹丹誓言迅速展开工作，利比亚经过2011年结束卡扎菲40统治的内战后，目前处于高度分化状态。

兹丹星期天还表示，解决安全问题将是当务之急。

利比亚新政府面临的挑战是设法解除民兵的武装并予以遣散，民兵参加革命后，仍然控制着很多地区。

*Libyan Lawmakers Select New Interim Prime Minister*

Libyan lawmakers have selected a new interim prime minister, a week after giving a vote of no confidence to their former pick for failing to present an acceptable Cabinet.

Libya's General National Congress on Sunday elected Ali Zidan, a former career diplomat who defected in the 1980s and became an outspoken critic of former leader Moammar Gadhafi. He later became a human rights advocate.

Zidan pledged to begin working quickly in a nation that remains highly polarized after the 2011 civil war that ended Gadhafi's four-decade rule.

Zidan also said Sunday that security will be a priority.

A new Libyan government faces the challenge of trying to disarm and demobilize militias that maintain control over parts of the country following their participation in the revolution.
