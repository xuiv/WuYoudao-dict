**众议院延期税案表决 财政不确定性增加**

美国国会众议院共和党领袖贝纳议长说，现在取决于奥巴马总统是否与参议院领袖展开合作，研究避免年底出现财政悬崖危机的计划。分析人士说，财政悬崖有可能让美国经济陷入衰退。

星期四晚间，在众议院共和党领导人突然推迟就议长贝纳提出的税收案进行的表决后不久，贝纳议长发表声明。

按照贝纳的方案，收入100万美元以上的家庭税率将提高。贝纳说，他没有得到足够的支持以通过这一方案。而早些时候他曾预计方案能够得到通过。

投票表决主要具有的是象征意义。民主党主控的参议院领导人说，贝纳的方案没有任何可能性能够在参议院过关。

而奥巴马总统则誓言，即使参众两院均通过贝纳的方案，他也将否决此方案。奥巴马希望，减税只适用于家庭收入达40万美元以下的人。

参议院的民主党人已经通过一项议案，将收入高于25万美元的家庭税率提高。他们表示，这是他们希望众议院议长贝纳拿出的方案。

国会议员们将于12月25日开始圣诞节休假。直到他们归来之前，众议院不大可能采取任何其他行动。

本星期早些时候，奥巴马总统曾说，他和贝纳已经相对接近达成协议。如果双方无法达成妥协，美国在1月1日就要跌入所谓“财政悬崖”，也就是自动削减5000亿美元的政府开支，并使几乎所有工作的美国人都要多缴税。

**Tax Vote Delay Raises Fiscal Uncertainty**

The top Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives says it is now up to President Barack Obama to work with the Senate's leader on a plan to avert a year-end crisis that analysts say could plunge the economy into recession.

House Speaker John Boehner issued the statement late Thursday, shortly after House Republican leaders abruptly put off a vote on his proposal that would have let tax rates rise for those earning $1 million or more. Boehner said he did not have enough support to pass the measure, although earlier in the day he had predicted victory.

A vote would have been largely symbolic. Leaders in the Democratic-controlled Senate said Boehner's plan had no chance of passing in that chamber.

Also, President Barack Obama, who wants a tax break extended only up to the $400,000 income level, had vowed to veto the measure even if both houses of Congress passed it.

Senate Democrats have already passed a bill that raises taxes on income higher than $250,000. They have said this is the plan they want from Boehner in the House.

It is unlikely that there will be any more House action until lawmakers return from their break for the December 25 Christmas holiday.

Earlier in the week, the president said he and Boehner were relatively close to an agreement on a compromise to avert what Washington is calling a "fiscal cliff" -- $500 billion in mandated spending cuts and tax increases that would affect almost all American workers starting January 1.

**世界卫生组织：疟疾仍然是威胁**

世界卫生组织说，虽然很多疟疾流行的国家过去10年里在防治疟疾方面取得很大进展，但是资金短缺可能会导致疟疾卷土重来。

世界卫生组织发布的疟疾新年度报告说，防治疟疾的工作在2004年到2009年取得快速扩展后，全球对防治疟疾工作的支持在过去一年里陷入停滞。本周发布的这份报告说，其结果是，在过去两年里，向疟疾流行的撒哈拉南部国家发放防蚊处理蚊帐的数量下降了一半以上，从2010年的1亿4500万顶跌到2012年的6600万顶。

尼日利亚和刚果民主共和国是该地区受冲击最严重的国家。在亚洲，印度是受影响最大的国家。

世界卫生组织官员理查德.斯杜尔斯基斯说，在非洲10个疟疾流行最严重的国家里，估计有110万人避免死于疟疾。他说，另外50个国家正致力于在2015年将疟疾病例减少75%。

不过他说，减少提供药物、蚊帐和其他防治疟疾的工具等方面的资金，将导致疟疾感染卷土重来。

**WHO: Malaria Still Poses Threat **

The World Health Organization says that despite great progress in treating and preventing malaria in many affected countries over the past decade, a shortage of funds could lead to a resurgence of the disease.

The WHO's new annual report on malaria says global support for the fight against malaria has stalled in the past year after a rapid expansion between 2004 and 2009. The report issued this week says that as a result, the delivery of insecticide-treated mosquito nets delivered to endemic countries in sub-Saharan Africa dropped by more than one-half over the past two years -- from 145 million in 2010 to 66 million in 2012.

Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo are the hardest hit countries in that region. India is the most affected country in Asia.

WHO official Richard Cidulskis says an estimated 1.1 million deaths from malaria have been averted in 10 most affected countries in Africa. He said another 50 countries are on track to reduce malaria incidence by 75 percent by 2015.

But he says a decrease in funds for medication, nets and other means of fighting the disease could lead to its renewed spread.
