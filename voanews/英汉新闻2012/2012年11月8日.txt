**美国国会权力平衡状态维持不变**

星期二选举过后，美国国会席位的变动很小，国会的权力分配格局基本不变。民主党仍然控制参议院，共和党则继续保持在众议院的多数地位。

参议院多数党领袖里德说，选举已经结束，现在到了把政治分歧放在一边，为国家面临的问题寻找解决方案和妥协意见的时候了。

星期三，众议院议长贝纳在国会山对记者说，他祝贺奥巴马总统和拜登副总统获选连任。但贝纳警告说，目前的当务之急是解决美国的“财政悬崖”问题。6000亿美元自动增税和削减开支的方案将在明年1月1号开始生效。

贝纳说，选择共和党来领导众议院的美国人民表明了态度，委任政界人士齐心协力解决问题。

在参议员选举中，民主党在一些关键州取胜，将保持该党的微弱多数地位。民主党将占有53个席位，共和党占有45个席位。独立人士将在100个席位的参议院中占有两个席位。

目前的选举预测显示，众议院435个席位基本没有变化。共和党拥有233个席位，民主党到目前为止赢得192个席位。贝纳将继续担任众议院议长职务。

民调结果显示，很多美国人看到自己的日常生活几乎没有任何改善，同时政治动作和敌对状态则触目皆是，他们对此感到不满。但在星期二大选前的几个星期里，他们对国会议员们的看法似乎有所改善。

**Balance of Power Remains Unchanged in US Congress**

While a few congressional seats changed hands in U.S. elections Tuesday, the balance of power in Congress remains the same, with Democrats in control of the Senate, and Republicans keeping their majority in the House of Representatives.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said now that the election is over, it is time to put politics aside and find solutions and compromise to the problems facing the country.

Speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill Wednesday, House Speaker John Boehner congratulated President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden on their reelection victory. But he warned that urgent action is needed with the country's looming "fiscal cliff" -- $600 billion in automatic tax increases and spending cuts that are set to take effect January 1.

Boehner said the American people, who have elected Republicans to lead the House, have spoken and given politicians a mandate to work together.

In the Senate, Democrats took a number of key Senate races and will keep their slim majority. They will have 53 seats, while Republicans will have 45 seats. Independents will have two spots in the 100-member chamber.

With nearly all the House races called, projections indicate little will change in the 435-seat chamber. Republicans have 233 seats, while Democrats so far have won 192. Boehner will retain his post.
Polls have shown many Americans have been frustrated by what they see as rampant politicking and animosity, while seeing little improvement in their day-to-day lives. But their views of lawmakers appeared to improve in the weeks preceding Tuesday's election.

**阿萨德誓言不离开叙利亚**

叙利亚总统阿萨德说，他不会离开自己的国家，并警告其它国家不要对叙利亚进行军事干预。

阿萨德在接受“今日俄罗斯”电视节目的采访时说，军事干预将会产生多米诺骨牌效应，波及全世界。

他还说，他不是傀儡，无论生死都会留在叙利亚。

“今日俄罗斯”星期四在网站上发表了采访阿萨德的节选，没有说什么时候进行的采访，但是说将于星期五播出完整的采访。

英国首相卡梅伦本星期早些时候建议，如果能保证结束叙利亚的内战，将允许阿萨德安全离开叙利亚。

叙利亚反政府派系星期四在卡塔尔会谈，商讨建立由反政府力量和政界人士组成的更广泛、更统一的委员会，把阿萨德赶下台。

这个拟议建立的委员会将组建叙利亚临时政府，协调各派反政府武装派系。委员会中三分之一的席位将留给流亡海外的最大反政府组织叙利亚国民委员会。

星期四的会谈之前，叙利亚国民委员会选出了它的40人领导委员会。但是该组织的官员说，成员数量很可能将增加，因为已选出的成员中没有女性。

*Assad Vows to Remain in Syria*

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad says he will not leave his country, and warned against foreign military intervention in Syria.

In an interview with Russia Today television, Mr. Assad said intervention would have a "domino effect" with implications for the rest of the world.

He also said he is "not a puppet" and would live and die in Syria.

Russia Today posted the excerpts from an interview with Mr. Assad on its website Thursday. It did not say when the conversation took place, but that it would broadcast the full interview on Friday.

British Prime Minister David Cameron suggested earlier this week that Mr. Assad could be allowed safe passage out of Syria if that would guarantee an end to the country's civil war.

Syrian opposition members are holding talks Thursday in Qatar on a plan to create a broader, more unified council of rebels and political figures pushing to oust Mr. Assad.

The proposed group would later choose a temporary government for Syria and coordinate with the revolt's military wing. The plan would give about a third of the seats to members of the Syrian National Council, the main opposition group in exile.

Ahead of the Thursday meeting, the SNC elected its own 40-person leadership body, but officials said more members would likely be added because no women were selected.
