罗姆尼的一名发言人表示，罗姆尼准备在摇摆州爱奥华发表的演说，这将是他最后阶段的陈述，着重强调他和奥巴马总统两人在经济问题立场上的差异。

过去40个小时在美国进行旋风式竞选活动的奥巴马总统，星期五则将待在白宫，接受一些媒体采访。

投票即将于11月6日举行。竞选最后阶段的民意调查显示，两位总统候选人的支持度基本不分轩轾。

**Romney to Give 'Major' Economic Speech; Obama Rests from Campaign Trail**

U.S. President Barack Obama is taking a break from the campaign trail Friday, while his Republican challenger Mitt Romney makes what his aides say is a major economic address.

A campaign spokesperson says Mr. Romney's speech in the so-called swing state of Iowa is the candidate's "closing argument" and will highlight differences in economic policy with the president.

Mr. Obama, who is coming off a 40-hour campaign blitz across the country, is spending most of Friday at the White House, where he will participate in several media interviews.

Polls have showed that the presidential race is virtually tied as the campaign enters its final stages before the November 6 election.



**中国开放新建核电站禁令**

中国说，它的能源消耗近年来增长过快，对能源供应和环境都造成压力。

中国国务院星期三公布的能源状况与政策白皮书说，对化石能源资源的大量开发和使用加大了环境保护的压力。为了创造一个“安全、稳定和洁净”的能源产业，中国将终止对新建核电站的禁令，同时鼓励私营领域向能源领域更多投资，以开发出更多可持续能源的技术。

剑桥能源研究协会负责中国问题研究的周锡舟说，中国政府的能源政策面临重大障碍。他说：“由于需求迅速增长，中国必须找到能满足未来需求的能源供应，而减少对煤炭的依赖以及寻求能源资源多样化将是对中国的严峻挑战。”

*新能源政策*

中国的能源状况与政策白皮书公布之际，中国即将进行每十年一次的最高领导层换届。预计换届后中国的新领导人将宣布能源政策的改变。

中国是世界上最大的能源生产国和消费国，主要依靠对环境造成严重污染的煤和进口的石油。已经成为世界工厂的的中国一直在努力改善能源效率和寻求可持续的国内能源资源，其中包括核能发电。核电只占中国目前总发电量的1.8%。

**China Seeks More Nuclear Power in Energy Reform**

China says its energy consumption has been growing too quickly in recent years, putting a strain on the country's energy supply as well as on the environment.

"Fossil energy resources have been exploited on a large scale, causing a certain amount of damage to the eco-environment," read the White Paper on China's Energy Policy released Wednesday by the country's Cabinet.

To create an energy industry that is "secure, stable and clean," the statement said authorities are ending a ban on new nuclear plants, encouraging more private investment in the energy sector, and developing more sustainable-energy technology.

Zhou Xizhou, who heads the China team of the Cambridge Energy Research Associates, says the government's energy policy faces major obstacles. "They have to find enough supply to meet the future demand, because of how fast the demand is growing," he says. He says reducing the country's heavy dependence on coal and diversifying its energy resources will be a big challenge.

The "white paper" statement was released before November's once-in-a-decade leadership reshuffle, when a new group of senior officials is expected to announce policy changes.

China, which is the world's biggest consumer and producer of energy, relies mostly on heavily polluting coal, as well as oil imports for energy production.

But as the center of global manufacturing, the country has been trying to improve energy efficiency and improve sustainable, domestic energy sources. That includes more nuclear power, which makes up just 1.8 percent of the country's total energy production.

China's State Council decided Wednesday to resume construction of "a small number" of new nuclear power plants, after a suspension following Fukushima's disaster in March 2011.

This week's decision shows that, although concerned with safety, leaders in Beijing believe China's energy development cannot be sustained without tapping into nuclear energy.

Yang Fuqiang, senior advisor on energy, environment and climate change at the Natural Resources Defense Council in Beijing, says the safety guidelines governing nuclear-plant construction have been greatly strengthened since the Fukushima disaster.

He said the new measures are reassuring, but the government could still go further in ensuring the plants' safety.

"It was definitely correct to highlight nuclear safety," Li says, "But we also think that it is very important to establish a professional, effective management system for nuclear power that is managed by the central government," says Yang, "this was not mentioned by the China policy on energy in 2012."

Wednesday's white paper also pushed for a restructuring of the energy industry now dominated by state-owned enterprises.

"The Chinese government encourages private capital to participate in the exploration and development of energy resources, oil- and natural-gas-pipeline network construction and the electric-power industry," the document said.
"The energy sector is still backwards, when compared to other sectors in China," says Yang Fuqiang. "In recent years reform in the energy sector has pretty much come to a halt, the pace of reform has been very slow and price has not substantially changed."

Wednesday's documents said that "proactive efforts will be made in the pricing mechanism of electricity to gradually let the market decide the price of electricity."

Yang believes by removing price caps and making it easier for private companies to enter the energy sector, there will be a greater effort toward creating energy efficiency and making technological innovations.

After becoming the world's biggest carbon-dioxide emitter, China has committed to reducing its carbon intensity by 45 percent by 2020.

Although coal is set to remain Beijing's main power source, this week's policy paper projects that energy produced by other renewable sources, like nuclear, solar and wind, will increase to 30 percent in the next three years.
