**与反穆斯林影片有关的美国男子被逮捕**

一名美国官员表示，警察已经逮捕了一名据称制作了一则数星期来引发穆斯林世界致命抗议示威活动的电影制作者。

洛杉矶的美国检察官办公室的莫若泽克星期四说，纳考拉已经被拘押，他在保释听证会前将很快在联邦法庭出庭。

纳考拉据称是影片《穆斯林的无知》化名导演萨姆•巴奇莱的真实身份。本月早些时候，纳考拉短暂地被拘押，并受到他的缓刑监督官的询问。

这部影片把穆斯林先知穆罕默德描写成一个杀人的异类，激怒了很多穆斯林并引发了一系列的反美抗议示威活动，导致多人丧生。暴徒们焚烧美国使馆、学校和商家。

出于安全考虑，美国已经暂时从驻利比亚首都的美国大使馆撤出更多的工作人员，但是美国表示希望能够在下星期初让这些工作人员重返的黎波里。

一名在纽约的美国高级官员拒绝说明美国从利比亚撤出了多少工作人员，也不愿意谈及详情。目前，美国国务卿克林顿正在纽约参加联合国大会。
** US Man Linked to Anti-Islam Film Arrested**
A U.S. official says police have arrested the alleged filmmaker behind the video that sparked weeks of deadly protests across the Muslim world.

Thom Mrozek of the United States Attorney's Office in Los Angeles said Thursday that Nakoula Basseley Nakoula was taken into custody and will immediately appear in federal court ahead of a bail hearing.

Nakoula - allegedly the real identity behind the pseudonym Sam Bacile, the director of "Innocence of Muslims" - was briefly taken into custody earlier this month for questioning by his probation officer.

The film depicting the Prophet Muhammad as a thuggish deviant offended many Muslims and sparked a wave of anti-American protests that have cost several lives and saw mobs burn U.S. missions, schools and businesses.

The developments came as the United States temporarily withdrew more staff from its embassy in the Libyan capital for security reasons, but said it hopes to return them to Tripoli early next week.

A senior U.S. official, speaking in New York where Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is attending the U.N. General Assembly, declined to say how many staff were being withdrawn or discuss specifics.

美国国务院一位高级官员说，这次会议将作为联合国大会的场外活动举行，重点讨论支持叙利亚反对派、人道协助和国际社会对叙利亚政权施压问题。

这位官员说，还将讨论可能对叙利亚政权采取的单边措施，包括可能的制裁。

在一天之前，联合国难民署表示，有多达70万的叙利亚人可能在年底前从战祸肆虐之地逃走。
**Clinton to Host Talks on Syria**

Officials from several Western nations and their allies will meet to discuss coordination efforts among Syria's fractured opposition.

Friday's ad-hoc meeting of selected members of the Friends of Syria group, is hosted by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and will include ministers from more than 20 nations and representatives from local revolutionary councils.

A senior State Department official said the meeting, which takes place on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, will focus on support to the Syrian opposition, humanitarian assistance and international pressure on the Syrian regime.

The official says the discussions will include unilateral measures which can be taken on the regime including the possibility of sanctions.

The meeting comes a day after the U.N. Refugee agency said up to 700,000 Syrians could flee the conflict-ravaged country by the end of the year.
