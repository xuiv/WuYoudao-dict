**谷开来案庭审结束未宣判**

备受瞩目的前中共重庆市委书记薄熙来的妻子谷开来涉嫌谋杀案星期四庭审一天便宣告结束。

合肥的一名法院官员说，目前还没有宣判。他说，谷开来对被控罪名没有抗辩，而且“情况不错，精神状况稳定。”

谷开来及其勤务员张晓军被控去年11月在重庆市谋杀了英国商人海伍德，当时薄熙来担任中共重庆市委书记。

这桩案件是中国近年来政治上最敏感的案件，已经使谷开来的丈夫薄熙来落马。薄熙来一度被认为是中国政治中的一颗正在上升的新星。

观察人士说，谷开来案可能已经未审先定。谷开来如果被定罪的话，可能被判处死刑。不过，她丈夫的命运则不得而知。薄熙来正因腐败罪名受到调查。

**Gu Kailai Trial Ends Without Verdict**

The high-profile murder trial of the wife of disgraced Chinese politician Bo Xilai has ended after just one day.

A court official in the eastern city of Hefei said Thursday a verdict has not been delivered in the case. He said the defendant, Gu Kailai, did not object to the charges and is in "good shape and mentally stable."

Gu and her butler are charged with murdering British businessman Neil Heywood in November in the southwestern city Chongqing, where Bo was Communist Party leader.

The case is China's most politically sensitive in recent memory and has already brought down Gu's husband, Bo Xilai, who was once considered a rising star in Chinese politics.

The son of a famous revolutionary leader, the charismatic Bo had been a top contender for the Politburo Standing Committee, China's top decision-making body, before he was stripped of his political posts earlier this year.

Observers say the outcome of Gu's trial was likely decided beforehand. If convicted, Gu faces a possible death penalty. But the fate of her husband, who is being investigated for corruption, is not known.

** 人权组织敦促克林顿向尼日利亚领导人施压**

美国国务卿克林顿星期四短暂访问尼日利亚首都阿布贾，会见总统乔纳森和其他官员。

总部设在美国的人权组织“人权观察”说，克林顿应该鼓励乔纳森总统打击伊斯兰激进组织“博科圣地”所从事的暴力活动，并制止他属下安全部队践踏人权和腐败的行为。美国政府已经宣称三个博科圣地组织的领导人为恐怖分子。

克林顿在结束尼日利亚的短暂访问之后，还预定在星期四稍后前往加纳同该国总统马哈马举行会谈

** Clinton Urged to Press Nigerian Leader to Address Violence**

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is making a brief visit to Nigeria Thursday for meetings with President Goodluck Jonathan and other leaders.

She is traveling to the capital, Abuja, amid calls to urge Mr. Jonathan to address rising sectarian violence in Nigeria. Northern Nigeria is mostly Muslim. The south is mainly Christian.

U.S.-based Human Rights Watch says Clinton should encourage Mr. Jonathan to confront violence committed by the Islamist militant group, Boko Haram, as well as abuses and corruption by his own security forces. The U.S. government has declared three Boko Haram leaders as terrorists.

From Nigeria, Clinton is scheduled to travel to Ghana later Thursday for talks with President John Mahama.
