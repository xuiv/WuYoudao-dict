**奥巴马争取民众支持其避免“财政悬崖”计划**

美国总统奥巴马星期五将做一次竞选式出行，争取民众支持他的计划，以避免潜在的财政危机。

奥巴马将访问宾夕法尼亚州的一家玩具工厂，这是一系列公共活动的组成部分，争取美国民众支持他的战略，以避免在明年1月1号生效的削减6千亿美元开支和增税。

共和党议员说，围绕如何避免所谓“财政悬崖”的问题，共和党和民主党在打破僵持局面上几乎没有取得进展。

众议院议长贝纳说，他星期三晚间与奥巴马举行会谈以及星期四会晤财政部长盖特纳后，感到失望。

共和党人控制着众议院。众议院共和党领袖贝纳指责奥巴马总统本星期召集那些支持其税收主张的纳税人开会。奥巴马主张停止对富有的美国人实行减税政策。

强制性的削减开支将影响到重要的国防和国内计划。在减税方面的问题是，减税政策是否应该延长到12月31号之后。

参议院民主党领袖里德说：“我们仍然在等待共和党人给我们一个严肃的提议。”

**Obama Campaigns for Plan to Avoid Fiscal Cliff**

U.S. President Barack Obama is making a campaign-style trip Friday aimed at winning public support for his plan to avert a potential fiscal crisis.

Mr. Obama's visit to a toy factory in Pennsylvania is part of a series of public events to sell the nation on his strategy to avoid the $600 billion in spending cuts and tax increases set to take effect January 1.

Congressional Republicans say there is little progress in resolving the partisan stalemate over how to avoid the so-called "fiscal cliff."

House Speaker John Boehner said he was "disappointed" after speaking with the president late Wednesday and meeting with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on Thursday.

Boehner, the leader of the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, criticized the president for staging gatherings of taxpayers this week who support his call for eliminating tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.

The forced spending cuts would affect important defense and domestic programs, while the question on the tax cuts is whether they should be extended beyond their scheduled December 31 expiration.

The Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid, said, "We are still waiting for a serious offer from Republicans."

**埃及委员会批准宪法草案**

由伊斯兰主义者主导的委员会已经批准了埃及的新宪法草案，这一草案现在必须交付全民公决。

这个委员会遭到几名基督徒和自由派成员的抵制，但委员会仍把伊斯兰法规的原则作为主要立法来源。该委员会从星期四下午开始举行会议，会议持续到星期五凌晨，匆忙批准了宪法草案的234项条文。

该委员会将宪法草案表决日期提前，以便在埃及最高宪法法院预期周日裁定是否解散该委员会之前通过宪法草案。

在过去几天中，大约30名自由派人士和基督教成员退出了宪法起草委员会，以抗议他们所说的效忠于埃及总统穆尔西的伊斯兰主义者强行操纵宪法起草过程。

埃及总统穆尔西上星期颁发政令，赋予自己广泛的新权力，因而引发了国内政治动荡局势。穆尔西星期四接受埃及国家电视台采访时说，选民就新宪法投票后，他颁布的政令将立即失效。

穆尔西总统的扩权政令引发了埃及民众持续一个多星期的抗议。在全国范围的示威活动中，两人被打死，数百人受伤。

**Egyptian Panel Approves Draft Constitution**

An Islamist-dominated panel has approved Egypt's new draft constitution that must now be voted on in a nationwide referendum.

The panel, boycotted by several Christian and liberal members, has retained the principles of Islamic law as the main source of legislation. The group hastily rushed through the approval of the 234 articles in a meeting that lasted from Thursday afternoon until early Friday.

The assembly moved up the vote in order to pass the draft before Sunday, when Egypt's highest judicial power is expected to rule on whether to dissolve the panel.

Over the past few days, about 30 liberal and Christian members pulled out of the panel to protest what they called the hijacking of the process by Islamists loyal to President Mohamed Morsi.

The Egyptian leader caused a political uproar last week when he granted himself sweeping new powers. Mr. Morsi told state television Thursday the decree will end immediately after people vote on the constitution.

Egyptians angered by the president's power grab have protested for more than a week. Two people have been killed and hundreds injured in the nationwide demonstrations.
