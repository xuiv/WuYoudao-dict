**Peace Envoy Calls for Transition in Syria**

As diplomacy to end the Syria crisis escalates, peace envoy Lakhar Brahimi on Thursday called for the installation of a transitional government in Syria that would run the country until elections could be held.

Brahimi's comments come as a Syrian envoy was in Moscow where Russia said Thursday that it was intensifying its efforts to end bloodshed in Syria.

Brahimi, who plans to be in Russia on Saturday for talks on Syria, told reporters in Damascus that a transition period must not lead to a collapse of the state or state institutions.

Brahimi commented as he wrapped up his latest trip to Syria, which included talks with President Bashar al-Assad.

**印度轮奸事件受害女子送往新加坡治疗**
本月早些时候在新德里惨遭轮奸和毒打的一名印度女子已被飞机送往新加坡做进一步治疗，与此同时，印度总理誓言一定要关心妇女安全问题。

新加坡伊丽莎白山医院说，这名23岁的受害女子已在星期四早晨抵达医院，她的情况“极度危急”。

同天早些时候，治疗受害女子的印度医院的医务总监B.D.阿塔尼说，受害人已经接受了三次手术，但情况仍处在危急状态。

他说，新加坡的这家医院有着先进的多种器官移植设施，而且有关方面还做出安排，让女子的家人随行。

印度内政部长辛德发表声明说，“虽然我们的医生进了最大努力，但受害者仍处在危急状态，她的身体状况仍然不稳定，这让我们所有的人都感到担心。”

12月16日，这名女子搭乘一辆包租大巴时遭到车上一群男子的轮奸，他们还用一根铁棒打她，然后把她扔出车外。

警方逮捕了六名据称参与袭击的人，他们被控强奸和谋杀未遂。

印度总理辛格在星期四的一次发展会议上说，针对妇女的袭击发生在“所有的邦和地区”，国家和地方官员必须加大关注力度。

他说：“妇女的安全是我们政府的最高关注。目前正在组建一个调查委员会，就是要查看首都的这些问题。”

他说，如果没有女性的积极参与，如果她们的安全得不到保障，印度就谈不上什么真正的发展。

轮奸事件在新德里激起了数日的大规模抗议。星期四，数百名示威者试图游行走到新德里的政府建筑，但被配备着催泪瓦斯和高压水龙头的防暴警察拦住。

与此同时，印度总统普拉纳布·慕克吉的儿子阿比吉特的一番讲话星期四激起众怒。他说，抗议者不是学生，而是“脸上有坑被涂抹”的女人，她们浓妆艳抹，把抗议当时髦。他说，示威“一定是某政党不可告人目的的一部分”。

活动人士、政界领袖和阿比吉特·慕克吉的姐姐都表态反对他的讲话，他随后为自己的言论做了道歉。

**India Gang-Rape Victim Flown to Singapore**

A Indian woman who was the victim of a gang rape and brutal beating earlier this month in New Delhi has been flown to Singapore for further treatment, while the Indian prime minister is pledging to focus on the issue of women's safety.

Singapore's Mount Elizabeth Hospital said the 23-year-old victim arrived at the facility early Thursday in "extremely critical condition."

Earlier in the day, B.D. Athani, medical superintendent at the Indian hospital where she had been treated, said the woman has already undergone three operations and remains in critical condition.

He said the hospital in Singapore has an advanced multi-organ transplant facility, and that arrangements have been made for the woman's family to accompany her there.

Indian Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde said in a statement that "despite the best efforts of our doctors, the victim continues to be critical and her fluctuating health remains a big cause of concern for all of us."

The woman was traveling on a charter bus on December 16 when a group of men on board raped and beat her with an iron rod and then threw her from the bus.

Police have arrested six alleged attackers, who are accused of rape and attempted murder.

Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told a development conference Thursday that attacks against women happen "in all states and regions" and require greater attention from national and local officials.

"The safety and security of women is of the highest concern to our government. A commission of inquiry is being set up to look into precisely these issues in the capital."

He said India cannot have meaningful development without the active participation of women, and that their security must be assured.

The government on Wednesday announced a commission that will review police response to the attack, while another panel is tasked with suggesting ways to make the capital safer for women as well as changes to the law to create stiffer penalties for such crimes.

The gang rape has sparked days of widespread protests in New Delhi urging the government to address crimes against women. On Thursday, hundreds of demonstrators tried to march to government buildings in the capital but were stopped by riot police armed with tear gas and water cannons.

Meanwhile, Indian President Pranab Mukherjee's son, Abhijit, was sharply criticized Thursday for saying the protesters were not students but "dented and painted" women who wear heavy makeup and think it is fashionable to protest. He said the demonstrations "must be part of some hidden agenda of some political party."

Mukherjee later apologized after activists, political leaders and his sister came out against his remarks.
