**Attacks Kill 91 Across Iraq **

Iraqi officials say a wave of bombings and shootings has killed at least 103 people and wounded 200 others on the deadliest day in Iraq this year.

Authorities said the attacks Monday included gunmen killing at least 15 Iraqi soldiers at a military base in northeastern Iraq as well as a series of explosions in the northern city of Kirkuk. A car bomb also exploded in Baghdad, while other deadly attacks targeted Taji, just north of the capital.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility.

The violence comes after jihadist websites posted a message Saturday, purportedly from the leader of al-Qaida's affiliate in Iraq, saying the group is starting a "new phase." The audio message from a speaker identified as Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi says the Islamic State of Iraq is planning to attack court officials, and to free prisoners.
