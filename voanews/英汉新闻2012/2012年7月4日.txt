**据称缅甸总统考虑改组内阁以加速改革**

据报道，缅甸总统吴登盛计划改组内阁，新任命一名副总统，作为加快改革速度的步骤之一。

媒体星期三援引缅甸政府高层官员的话说，吴登盛不久将罢免几名持强硬立场、反对缅甸最近政治改革的部长。

这些官员还说，缅甸政府已经证实副总统丁昂敏吴辞职的消息。丁昂敏吴曾是高级将领，与退休的军政权领导人丹瑞关系密切。

吴登盛去年执政以来，面对着来自政府内部一些人士的批评，他们不愿放弃以往将近五十年代军事独裁政权所享有的那种权力。

缅甸议会重新开会议事，被视为缅甸是否继续实行改革的重要考验，因为有少数但是重要的议员来自曾被取缔的全国民主联盟。

**Burma President Said to Be Considering Cabinet Reshuffle to Accelerate Change**

Burmese President Thein Sein is reported to be planning to reshuffle his cabinet and appoint a new vice president as part of an effort to push for quicker reforms in Burma.

Senior government officials were quoted in reports Wednesday as saying the president will soon drop several hardliner government ministers who were opposed to the recent political reforms in Burma.

Officials also say the government has confirmed the resignation of Vice President Tin Aung Myint Oo, a former top general who is close to retired military leader Than Shwe.

Since taking power last year, President Thein Sein has faced criticism from some in his government who are reluctant to give up the powers enjoyed by the military dictatorship that ruled the country for nearly half a century.


The reconvening of the National Assembly is seen as a key test of continued reform in Burma, because it will now include a small but important minority of lawmakers from the once-banned National League for Democracy.

The foreign secretaries of India and Pakistan have opened a round of talks partly aimed at strengthening a peace deal shaken by fresh tensions linked to the 2008 terror attacks that killed 166 people in India's financial capital, Mumbai.

India's Ranjan Mathai and Pakistan's Jalil Abbas Jilani met in New Delhi, days after India repeated charges of Pakistani involvement in the Mumbai attacks.

Jilani arrived Tuesday in New Delhi, promising India support in its fight against terrorism. He also urged India to share information about a key suspect who Indian officials say has revealed the Mumbai attacks were coordinated in Pakistan with state support.

Pakistan has denied involvement in the Mumbai attacks.

During talks this week, Indian and Pakistani officials will also discuss trade, confidence-building measures and the disputed region of Kashmir.
