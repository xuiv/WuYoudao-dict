**US Condemns 'Heavy-Handed' Crackdown on Sudan Protests**

The United States has condemned Sudan's "heavy-handed" crackdown against anti-government protests that have spread through several parts of the East African nation.

The protests began in the capital, Khartoum, nearly two weeks ago as isolated student protests over planned government austerity measures and sharp price increases.

The unrest has quickly spread into larger and more volatile demonstrations throughout the capital and several other parts of the country. Sudanese security forces have responded harshly, using tear gas and batons on protesters, who have responded by throwing rocks and burning tires in the streets.

U.S. State Department spokesperson Nuland said the crackdown on protesters will not solve Sudan's economic crisis. She called for Sudan to immediately release all of those detained.
