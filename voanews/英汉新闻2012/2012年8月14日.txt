美国国防部长帕内塔说，他深信不疑美国可在叙利亚上空设立禁飞区，但尚未就需要授权执行这项使命做出“重大决策”。

帕内塔对美联社说，美国计划应对叙利亚可能出现的一些事态。他表示，设立禁飞区有难度，而且并非当务之急。

联合国人道事务负责人星期二将开始对叙利亚和黎巴嫩进行为期三天的访问，讨论如何为陷于战火的平民紧急提供救援。

星期一，叙利亚反对派在互联网上传一段录像，录像画面显示了据称是被击落的一架叙利亚政府军战机以及被俘获的飞行员。叙利亚反对派上传录像的真实性不能得到独立消息来源的证实。

叙利亚国家媒体说，一架战机星期一在叙利亚东部执行例行训练任务时出现技术故障后，飞行员跳伞，目前有关当局正在寻找他。

*Panetta: Syria No-Fly Zone Possible*

U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta says he is confident the United States could enforce a no-fly zone over Syria, but that a "major decision" needed to authorize such a mission has not been made.

Panetta told the Associated Press the United States has planned for a number of possible events in Syria. He says a no-fly zone is difficult to implement, and is not a top priority.

Meanwhile, foreign ministers of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation are holding a summit in Mecca Tuesday, after agreeing to recommend suspending Syria from the group.

The move by the 57-member OIC could lead to a diplomatic dispute during the summit between Syrian ally Iran and pro-opposition Saudi Arabia.

Also Tuesday, the United Nations humanitarian chief begins a three-day visit to Syria and Lebanon to discuss ways to urgently boost relief efforts to civilians caught up in the conflict.

Syrian rebels on Monday circulated video of what they claim is the downing of a Syrian plane and the captured pilot. The rebel video cannot be independently verified.

State media say a pilot ejected Monday after suffering technical problems during a "routine training mission" in eastern Syria, and that authorities are searching for him.
