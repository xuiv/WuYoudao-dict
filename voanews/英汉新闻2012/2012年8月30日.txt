**美国共和党副总统候选人瑞安承诺解决经济问题**

获得美国共和党副总统候选人提名的保罗·瑞安承诺，如果美国选民在今年11月大选中选举共和党候选人罗姆尼担任总统，就将结束经济领域的所有“借口和空话”。

星期三晚上，瑞安在共和党全国大会上接受副总统候选人提名后，发表了措辞有力的演讲。

瑞安在共和党全国大会上说，民主党只留下了“畏惧和分裂”。他严厉批评奥巴马总统和其他民主党人四年来一直在诿过于人，而不是努力解决问题。

瑞安说，他和罗姆尼将“以严肃的方式面对严重的挑战”，但他同时警告说，美国的经济问题是如此之大而没有太多的时间来解决这些问题。

现年42岁的瑞安是来自威斯康辛州的国会众议员，虽然他由于主张大幅削减社会福利项目而受到抨击，但他使保守派活动人士感到振奋。

** Republican VP Candidate Ryan Promises Fixes, Not Excuses**


U.S. Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan has promised an end to "excuses and idle words" when it comes to the economy if voters elect the party's presidential candidate Mitt Romney in November election.

Ryan gave a strongly-worded acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention Wednesday night.

Ryan told the convention that "fear and division" is all the Democratic party has left, chastising U.S. President Barack Obama and his fellow Democrats for spending the past four years blaming others for problems instead of finding solutions.

Ryan said he and Mr. Romney will "meet serious challenges in a serious way" but warned the country's economic problems are so big that there is not much time to fix them.

The 42-year-old lawmaker from Wisconsin has energized conservative activists, even though he has come under fire for his proposals to impose deep cuts in social programs.

**美国取消对缅甸总统吴登盛的签证限制**

美国总统奥巴马取消了对缅甸总统吴登盛的入境签证限制，以便他在下月纽约举行联合国大会期间访问美国。

奥巴马星期三下令取消签证禁令，允许吴登盛在联合国大会期间自由旅行。否则，按照美国对缅甸领导人的旅行限制，吴登盛只能在联合国总部周围很小区域内活动。


美国官员说，奥巴马这一决定显示美国愿意与缅甸政府进行更密切的接触。缅甸政府正在脱离数十年来的专制统治轨道。

美国国会2008年通过立法，禁止美国在缅甸投资，并禁止从缅甸进口某些商品，此外还对参与侵犯人权的缅甸军政官员的签证加以限制。

**US Waives Visa Restrictions For Burma's Leader**

U.S. President Barack Obama has waived visa restrictions for Burma's president, Thein Sein, to allow him to visit the United States during next month's United Nations General Assembly in New York.

President Obama Wednesday ordered an exception in a visa ban to let Thein Sein travel freely during the U.N. General Assembly. Otherwise, Thein Sein would be confined to a narrow area around the U.N. headquarters due to a U.S. travel ban on Burmese leaders.

U.S. officials say Mr. Obama's decision signals U.S. interest in closer engagement with Burma's government, which is shifting away from decades of authoritarian rule.

U.S. legislation from 2008 bans U.S. investment in Burma and the import of certain goods from the country. It also restricts visas for government and military officials who have been involved in human rights abuses.
