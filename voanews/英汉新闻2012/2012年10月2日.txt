**韩国两核反应堆因故障关闭**

韩国两座核反应堆先后出现看来是互不关联的故障后关闭。韩国官员说，没有核辐射泄漏的危险。

韩国操作核反应堆的人员说，釜山附近的新古里一号核反应堆的控制棒出现问题，于星期二早晨关闭。

稍后，有关官员说，首尔以南260公里处的灵光核电厂5号反应堆也出现和新古里的核反应堆不关联的故障。

韩国的核电厂提供全国所需电力的三分之一以上。尽管去年日本发生了核泄漏事故，但是资源贫乏的韩国仍然大力推动核能发电。

** Two S. Korean Nuclear Reactors Shut Down by Malfunctions **

Two South Korean nuclear power reactors have been shut down following apparently unrelated malfunctions. Officials say there is no danger of a radiation leak.

South Korean nuclear operators say the Shingori-1 reactor, near the city of Busan, was shut down early Tuesday following a control rod malfunction.

A short time later, the number 5 reactor at the Yeonggwang facility, 260 kilometers south of Seoul, also suffered what officials say appears to be an unrelated malfunction.

South Korea depends on atomic plants to generate more than one-third of its electricity. The resource-poor country has vowed to push forward with nuclear power, despite last year's nuclear disaster in Japan.

**美对柬严判活动人士“深感关注”**

美国对柬埔寨对一位知名土地维权人士定罪表示“深感关注”。活动人士索那多被以煽动叛乱罪判处20年徒刑。

美国国务院星期一针对索那多被严判发表声明，敦促柬埔寨政府立即释放71岁的索那多。

星期一柬埔寨一家法庭判定索那多有罪，指控他今年早些时候在柬埔寨东部地区发生一场土地纠纷后，煽动村民自行建国。

索那多否认犯有被指控的罪行。他拥有的蜂窝独立广播电台有时播出批评1985年以来一直在柬埔寨执政的洪森总理的消息。

**US Slams 'Harsh' Sentence against Cambodia Gov't Critic **

The United States says it is "deeply concerned" at the conviction of a prominent Cambodian land rights campaigner who was sentenced to 20 years in prison on insurrection charges.

In a statement Monday, the State Department characterized the sentence against Mam Sonando as "harsh" and called on the Cambodian government to immediately release the 71-year-old.

A Cambodian court on Monday convicted Sonando of inciting villagers to try to form their own state following a land dispute in eastern Cambodia earlier this year.

Sonando denied the charges. His radio station, known as Beehive Radio, sometimes broadcasts material critical of Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has ruled Cambodia since 1985.
