**Giant Storm Floods New York, Kills 14 in North America**

The massive storm named Sandy has brought torrential rain, high winds and dangerous tidal surges to one of the nation's most densely populated regions and killing at least 14 people.

Sandy - with winds still reaching 120 kilometers per hour - came ashore Monday with hurricane-strength winds some 200 kilometers south of New York, bringing a storm surge of four meters to lower Manhattan. The usually bustling city was brought to a halt. More than 1 million people in the area of the nation's largest city are without power. More than 6 million homes and businesses along the U.S. east coast and farther inland are without power. The center of the storm moved inland early Tuesday.

A New Jersey nuclear power plant declared an alert after waters rose to a designated high-level mark. Officials said there were no safety concerns at the plant, which was shut off for maintenance.

The deaths were reported across the affected region, from the U.S. state of Maryland to the Canadian city of Toronto. Most of the fatalities resulted from falling trees or traffic accidents.

Tunnels and streets in low-lying areas of New York City were flooded, including the construction site where the World Trade Center once stood. Some residents were ordered to evacuate. Cars in low-lying areas have been seen floating down the streets.

Other U.S. cities along the Eastern seaboard, including Washington, were also at a standstill, with public transit systems suspended, airports closed.

奥巴马和罗姆尼都取消了原订的星期二竞选计划，集中精力面对风暴受灾民众，并呼吁为救援组织捐款。

这场风暴的波及范围包括几个成为政治战场的州，包括维吉尼亚、北卡罗来纳、宾夕法尼亚、纽约和俄亥俄。分析人士说，这几个州对于11月6号大选的结果具有关键意义。

在维吉尼亚州和北卡罗来纳州，几个早期投票站因风暴侵袭而关闭，华盛顿的投票站星期二继续关闭。
