瓦莱丽·阿莫斯星期一宣布，这次为期三天的访问将于星期二开始，访问的目的是为了让人们关注叙利亚不断恶化的人道主义局势，以及这种局势对仍在那里的老百姓以及那些已经逃出叙利亚、包括逃到黎巴嫩的叙利亚人的影响。

The United Nations humanitarian chief Valerie Amos says she will travel to Syria and Lebanon this week to discuss ways of increasing aid to civilians caught up in the Syrian conflict.

Valerie Amos announced Monday that the three-day visit, beginning Tuesday, is aimed at drawing attention to the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Syria, and the impact on people who are still in the country and those who have fled to other countries, including Lebanon.

The Arab League postponed a meeting of foreign ministers that had been scheduled for Sunday in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to discuss the Syrian situation and a replacement for peace envoy Kofi Annan, who resigned earlier this month.

**联合国秘书长潘基文敦促朝鲜半岛南北双方缓和紧张局势**

联合国秘书长潘基文敦促朝鲜半岛南北双方缓和半岛的紧张局势。

潘基文星期一在首尔会晤韩国外交通商部长官金星焕时做出上述评论。

最近几个月来，朝鲜半岛局势恶化。朝鲜威胁要对韩国保守派政府发动一场它所称的“神圣战争”，因为朝鲜指责韩国保守派政府诬蔑并阴谋推翻朝鲜政府。

平壤正在设法应对水灾带来的巨大破坏，水灾已经导致至少169人丧生，数以百计的人失踪和被大水冲走，并淹没了6万5千多公顷的农田。潘基文曾经担任过韩国外交通商部长官。他说，联合国承诺将继续向朝鲜提供紧急救援。

联合国和其他国际组织向朝鲜提供帐篷等紧急物资，但是朝鲜官员表示，这些物资难以送达某些水灾地区，因为通往那里的公路和铁路还没有修复。

**UN Chief Urges North, South Korea to Ease Tensions**

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has urged North and South Korea to ease tensions on the peninsula.

Mr. Ban's comments came during a meeting Monday with South Korean Foreign Minister Kim Sung-hwan in Seoul.

Cross-border relations have worsened in recent months. The North has threatened what it calls a "sacred war" against the South's conservative government for alleged insults to, and plots against, its government.

Pyongyang is also struggling with the devastation of floods that killed at least 169 people, left hundreds missing and washed away or inundated more than 65 thousand hectares of cropland. Mr. Ban, a former South Korean foreign minister, said the United Nations was committed to continue its emergency aid to the North.

The world body and other international organizations are providing emergency items, such as tents. But North Korean officials say they are not reaching people in some flooded areas because access to roads and railways has not been restored.
