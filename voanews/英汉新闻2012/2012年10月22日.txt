**黎巴嫩首都冲突造成6人受伤**

黎巴嫩安全官员说， 一名安全部门高级官员的遇刺使黎巴嫩的紧张局势不断升级，在贝鲁特南部发生的冲突中至少有6人受伤。

星期一，当局在首都喀斯卡斯区逊尼派和什叶派社区之间布署了军队和坦克，试图平息该地区势态。

另外在黎巴嫩北部城市的黎波里发生的冲突中至少有一人丧生，10人受伤。与此同时一群抗议人士在黎巴嫩总理米卡提办公室外搭起帐篷，誓言要坚持到总理辞职为止。

这次发生在贝鲁特市中心的静坐行动从星期日晚上开始。在此之前，黎巴嫩安全部队向空中开枪，并使用了催泪弹试图驱散聚集到这一办公楼外的抗议人群。

抗议者要求总理米卡提就高层情报官员哈桑准将遇刺一事引咎辞职。哈桑是高级情报官员，在上星期五的一次汽车爆炸事件中，他和其他七人遇难。很多人指责制造这一事件的是邻国叙利亚政府。

黎巴嫩前总理哈里里和反对派领导人琼布拉特都指责叙利亚总统阿萨德是爆炸事件的幕后指使者。总理米卡提的政府受到亲叙利亚的黎巴嫩真主党武装的支持。

Clashes Wound 6 in Lebanese Capital

Lebanese security officials say at least six people have been wounded in clashes in southern Beirut, amid rising tensions following the assassination of a top security official.

Soldiers and tanks were deployed between Sunni and Shi'ite neighborhoods in the capital's Kaskas district Monday, trying to bring calm to the area.

Separate fighting in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli killed at least one person and wounded 10 others.

Meanwhile, a group of protesters has set up tents outside Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati's office, vowing to remain there until he resigns.

The sit-in began late Sunday outside the building in central Beirut. Earlier Sunday, Lebanese security forces fired their weapons into the air and used tear gas to disperse protesters who were trying to storm the building.

The demonstrators are demanding Mr. Mikati quit over the assassination of Brig. Gen. Wissam al-Hassan, a top intelligence official who died along with seven others in a car bombing Friday that many blame on the government in neighboring Syria.

Former Lebanese prime minister Saad Hariri and opposition leader Walid Jumblatt have both accused Syrian President Bashar al-Assad of being behind the blast. Prime Minister Mikati's government is supported by Lebanon's pro-Syrian Hezbollah militia.


**卡斯特罗驳斥有关其濒死传言**

古巴前领导人卡斯特罗在国有媒体上撰写文章，驳斥有关他即将死亡的说法。这篇文章星期一早上刊登在cubadebate.cu网站上，同时还刊登了几张这位86岁前领导人的照片。照片上显示卡斯特罗拄着拐杖站在户外，阅读一份上星期五的报纸。

委内瑞拉前副总统埃利亚斯星期天说，他与这名年迈的革命领袖星期六会晤了5个小时。埃利亚斯说，会晤结束后，卡斯特罗亲自陪同他回到了他在哈瓦那下塌的国宾馆。埃利亚斯向媒体展示了他和这位古巴前领导人会面的照片。

卡斯特罗最后一次公开露面是今年3月会见到访的教皇本笃16世。上个星期，有很多传言说卡斯特罗病入膏肓，生命危在旦夕。

卡斯特罗在1959年古巴革命后执掌了政权，他目前依然受到很多古巴人的喜爱。前一段时间他因未公开露面而引发很多有关他健康的疑问。2006年卡斯特罗因肠胃疾病而暂时将权力交给他的弟弟劳尔.卡斯特罗，并于2008年将权力全部移交给劳尔。

Castro Disputes Ill-Health Rumors

Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro has written an article in state media disputing claims he is on his death bed. It was posted on the cubadebate.cu Internet website early Monday, accompanied by several photographs of the 86-year-old former leader, showing him standing outside while leaning on a cane and reading a newspaper from Friday.

On Sunday former Venezuelan Vice President Elias Jaua said he met with the aging revolutionary icon for five hours.

Jaua said Mr. Castro personally accompanied him back to the Hotel Nacional in Havana after their meeting Saturday. Jaua showed the media photographs of his encounter with the former Cuban leader.

Mr. Castro's last public appearance was in March with visiting Pope Benedict. Last week there was a flurry of rumors that Mr. Castro was seriously ill.

Mr. Castro rose to power after the 1959 revolution. He remains popular to many in Cuba, where previous absences have fueled questions about his health. He temporarily ceded power to his brother, Raul, in 2006 while suffering from an intestinal illness, before fully transferring power in 2008.
