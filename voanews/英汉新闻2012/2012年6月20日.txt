**Asia Number One Home of World's Millionaires**

Asia's population of millionaires outpaced that of North America for the first time last year, but the total net worth of the world's wealthiest people declined in the face of global economic uncertainty.

The newest World Wealth Report says the Asia-Pacific region was home to 3.37 million people having $1 million or more to invest, a 1.6 percent increase from the year before. North America was in second place with 3.35 million millionaires, a drop of just over one percent, while Europe was home to 3.17 million of the wealthiest people.

The annual report found that the world's total number of millionaires remained steady at 11 million people, but their combined net worth dropped 1.7 percent in 2011 .

**联合国监督人员将留在叙利亚**

联合国驻叙利亚监督团队负责人穆德少将星期二对联合国安理会说，监督团队屡次遭到火力袭击，但仍将坚持留在这个饱受战火蹂躏的国家。

穆德星期二说，现在谈论取消在叙利亚的监督使命还为时过早，并说叙利亚人民遭受的痛苦正在不断加深。

穆德对联合国安理会说，由300人组成的联合国监督团队几星期来数次遭到袭击，至少九辆联合国的汽车被毁。

穆德表示，由于叙利亚的暴力不断加剧，联合国监督团队上星期六暂停执行任务，但并未离开叙利亚。暂停执行任务的决定清楚表明，国际特使安南斡旋达成的和平计划已经失败。

**Mood: UN Team Will Stay in Syria**

The head of the United Nations monitoring mission in Syria told the Security Council Tuesday his team has been repeatedly targeted by gunfire but is committed to staying in the war-torn country.

Major General Robert Mood of Norway said Tuesday that questions about canceling the mission were premature, and that the "suffering of the Syrian people" is getting worse.


General Mood told the council his 300-strong unarmed observer team has been targeted several times over the last few weeks. He said at least nine U.N. vehicles have been damaged.

Mood said the U.N. mission in Syria was suspended on Saturday due to escalating violence, but team members did not leave the country. The decision was the clearest sign yet that a peace plan brokered by international envoy Kofi Annan has collapsed.
