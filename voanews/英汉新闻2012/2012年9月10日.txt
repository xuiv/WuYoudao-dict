UN Chief Slams Syrian Government, Rebels

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has condemned the Syrian government and rebel groups for choosing violence and force rather than dialogue.

In an opening speech Monday to a three-week session of the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, Mr. Ban also rebuked the U.N. Security Council for failing to take a unified stance to end the Syrian crisis.

He told delegates he is "deeply troubled by the aerial bombardments of civilians by government forces" in Syria and expressed concern at increasing sectarian tensions and the deteriorating humanitarian situation.

Mr. Ban urged nations and Syrians to unite behind the diplomatic efforts of the new U.N.-Arab League envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi.

The new envoy met with Egyptian and Arab League officials in Cairo Monday.


**美国将巴格拉姆监狱移交阿富汗**

尽管围绕如何处置某些囚犯的问题仍然存在分歧，美国已正式将一座有争议的监狱交由阿富汗政府控制。

星期一，在巴格拉姆监狱举行的小型交接仪式上，三千多名在押犯被移交给阿富汗官员。阿富汗总统卡尔扎伊赞扬这一举措，称其为阿富汗维护主权的胜利。

美国军方官员之前曾经表示，他们已经将大部分囚犯移交给了阿富汗，但是由于对阿富汗政府履行3月签署的备忘录的意愿感到担忧，所以停止了进一步移交囚犯。

目前还不清楚联军的担忧究竟是什么，但联军方面的顾虑看上来是上星期六阿富汗总统卡尔扎伊和美国与北约驻阿富汗联军司令艾伦将军举行会谈后出现的。

US AFGHANISTAN PRISON

The United States has formally handed over control of a controversial prison to the Afghan government, despite a disagreement about the fate of some of the inmates.

More than 3,000 prisoners were transferred to Afghan officials in a small ceremony Monday at the Bagram prison. The transfer of authority over the prison and its inmates has been hailed by Afghan President Hamid Karzai as a victory for sovereignty.

U.S. military officials said earlier they had already handed over most of the detainees. However, officials said they had suspended additional transfers because of concerns about the intentions of the Afghan government to fulfill the terms of a memorandum of understanding signed in March.

It was not immediately clear what those concerns are, but they seem to have emerged after a meeting Saturday between President Karzai and General John Allen, the top commander of American and NATO forces in Afghanistan.
