**前美国总统克林顿严厉抨击共和党**

在星期三晚上向美国全国电视转播的演讲中，前美国总统克林顿正式向民主党全国大会提名奥巴马为总统候选人。

在北卡罗来纳州夏洛特举行的民主党全国大会重要时段发表演讲时，克林顿严厉抨击共和党，认为共和党的观点与现实世界脱节。

克林顿仍然受到很多美国人的欢迎，他们还记得克林顿在上世纪90年代当政八年期间的经济繁荣。

民主党全国大会要把罗姆尼塑造成一个商人的形像。克林顿今年早些时候说，罗姆尼的记录显示他是纯粹的商人。

在星期三的演讲者中，有三名曾被贝恩资本公司控制的公司解雇的雇员。贝恩是一家资产管理公司，罗姆尼是该公司的共同创建者，并担任了几年首席执行官。其中一人说，美国经受不起罗姆尼的经济模式。他表示，这种经济模式把利润置于劳动者之上。
**Clinton Blames Republicans for 'Total Mess'**


Former U.S. president Bill Clinton has formally placed President Barack Obama's name up for the Democratic nomination during a nationally televised address Wednesday.

Mr. Clinton fired at the Republican party during his prime time speech at the Democratic National Convention, calling the Republican narrative an "alternative universe."


Mr. Clinton remains a popular figure among many Americans who recall the economic prosperity during his two terms in office in the 1990s.

The DNC aimed to strike at Mr. Romney's record as a businessman, which Mr. Clinton called "sterling" earlier this year.

Among the speakers Wednesday were three employees that were fired from companies controled by Bain Capital, an asset management firm that Mr. Romney co-founded and ran as CEO for several years. One of the employees said America cannot afford "Romney economics," which he said was "putting profits before working people."

**人权组织谴责中国强行遣返缅甸难民**

人权观察致信中国，指责中国违反国际法，强迫数千名缅甸人返回饱受冲突蹂躏的祖国。

人权观察说，北京最近遣返了至少4千名逃到中国云南省的缅甸克钦人。人权观察说，这些难民8月底被送回缅甸，此前当局简单地宣布他们不是难民。

自从2011年6月以来，数万人逃离缅甸北部的战火，当时缅甸军方和克钦族独立军之间持续17个月的停火归于失败。

中国否认强行遣返克钦人，声称他们在战火平息后自愿离开中国。但人权观察说，克钦邦的暴力仍在继续，又有数千人失去家园。

** Rights Group Slams China for Forcibly Returning Burma Refugees**

Human Rights Watch has sent a letter to China accusing it of violating international law by forcing thousands of Burmese to return to their conflict-torn homeland.

The group says Beijing recently returned at least 4,000 ethnic Kachins who had fled to China's Yunnan province. It says they were sent home in late August after the government "summarily declared" they were not refugees.

Tens of thousands of people have fled fighting in northern Burma since June 2011, when a 17-year cease-fire between the military and the Kachin Independence Army collapsed.

China has denied forcibly returning the Kachins, saying they voluntarily eturned to Burma when the fighting ended. But Human Rights Watch says the violence continues in Kachin state and that thousands more are being displaced.
