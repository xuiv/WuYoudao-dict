**世行预测亚太地区经济增长放缓**

世界银行发布了一份报告，预计今年亚洲经济增长将放缓。

这份星期一发布的报告说，亚太地区今年的经济增长率将下跌一个百分点，从2011年的8.2%下降到7.2%，但将于2013年反弹到7.6%。

世行新公布的报告还说，出口疲软和投资增长放缓将使中国的GDP增长率从2011年的9.3%下降到今年的7.7%。不过世界银行说，随着中国的刺激经济增长措施见效，预计中国的经济增长将回升到8.1%。

世界银行说，东亚和太平洋地区的决策者仍将在一个不稳定的环境中继续努力推动经济增长和减少贫困。

**World Bank Predicts Slowdown for Asian Economies**

The World Bank has issued a report predicting an economic growth slowdown in Asia this year.

Monday's report said economic grown in the Asia - Pacific region may slow down by a full percentage point, from 8.2 percent in 2011 to 7.2 percent this year, before recovering to 7.6 percent in 2013.

The new report also says that weak exports and lower investment growth will cut China's GDP growth from 9.3 percent in 2011 to 7.7 percent this year. However, the bank said it expects China's growth to rebound to 8.1 percent as the impact of stimulus measures kicks in.

The World Bank said policy makers in the East Asia and Pacific region will have to continue managing growth and reducing poverty in an environment that will remain volatile.

**罗姆尼要就外交政策发表首次重要讲话**

共和党总统候选人罗姆尼星期一首次就外交政策发表重要竞选演说。

罗姆尼将在维吉尼亚州的莱克星敦美国历史最悠久的军校维吉尼亚军校向学生讲演。

迄今为止，罗姆尼关注的焦点集中在经济问题和他推翻奥巴马总统医疗保险改革的计划方面。但是他批评了奥巴马总统的中东政策，他说，奥巴马任由美国被动地应付事态，而没有积极引导事态发展的方向。

罗姆尼上个月在华尔街日报撰文写道，事态的发展使得美国无力保护其人民和盟友。

奥巴马星期一将在加利福尼亚州参加“农场工人联合会”的已故领袖查维兹的纪念碑落成典礼。然后他将在旧金山参加募款晚餐会。

**Romney to Make First Major Foreign Policy Speech**

Republican U.S. presidential candidate Mitt Romney makes his first major campaign speech on foreign policy Monday.

Mr. Romney will speak to students at the Virginia Military Institute in the town of Lexington - the country's oldest military academy.

So far, he has focused mostly on the economy and his plans to repeal President Barack Obama's health care reforms. But he has criticized the president's Middle East policy, saying Mr. Obama is letting the United States be at the mercy of events rather than shaping them.

Mr. Romney wrote in The Wall Street Journal last month that events are moving the country away from being able to protect its people and allies.

President Obama is in California, where on Monday he will dedicate a monument to the late leader of the United Farm Workers union, Cesar Chavez. Later, he will attend a fundraising dinner in San Francisco.
