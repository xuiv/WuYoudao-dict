**联合国人权专员：必须避免叙利亚进一步的军事化**

联合国人权事务高级专员皮莱说，继续为叙利亚政府军和反政府武装提供武器助长了叙利亚的暴力，必须不惜一切代价予以制止。

皮莱星期一在纽约说，叙利亚政府和反对派要对大量侵犯人权行为负责。她谴责叙利亚总统阿萨德的军队向平民和医院开火以及强奸、折磨反对派支持者。

皮莱说，叙利亚那些试图去除阿萨德的反对派谋杀被怀疑为当局提供情报的人以及被指称的当局合作者，并使用土制炸弹杀害平民。

阿萨德将暴力行为和平民死亡归咎于恐怖分子。皮莱要求叙利亚政府允许独立调查人员进入叙利亚，对这一指称加以核实。

俄罗斯和中国是阿萨德的主要支持者，同时联合国官员说，卡塔尔和沙特阿拉伯一直为叙利亚反对派提供武器。

** UN Human Rights Chief: Further Militarization of Syria Must Be Avoided**

The United Nations human rights chief says the continued arming of both sides in Syria is fueling violence and must be halted at all costs.

Navi Pillay said Monday in New York that both the Syrian government and the opposition are responsible for numerous human rights violations. She accused President Bashar al-Assad's forces of indiscriminately firing on civilians and hospitals, along with rape, torture and targeting of opposition supporters for death.

Pillay said those trying to rid Syria of the Assad government have murdered suspected informers and alleged collaborators, and are using improvised bombs that have killed civilians.

President Assad blames the violence and civilian deaths on terrorists. Pillay is asking the Syrian government to let independent investigators into the country to verify that claim.

Russia and China have been major backers of President Assad while U.N. officials say Qatar and Saudi Arabia are supplying arms to the opposition.

**缅甸释放46名犯人**

缅甸国家媒体说，当局释放了46名囚犯，以此作为促进“民族团结”的特赦的组成部分。

官方媒体缅甸新光报说，遵照吴登盛总统的政令，37名男子和九名女子星期二获释。报道还说，34名外国犯人被递解出境。

但是，缅甸新光报在报道中没有说明这些获释犯人中是否包括政治犯。目前缅甸当局还关押着数百名政治犯。

自从名义上的缅甸文官政府去年执政以来，已有数百名政治犯获释。

作为对缅甸实行改革措施的回应，西方国家开始放松对缅甸的制裁。但很多西方国家仍然把无条件释放所有政治犯作为与缅甸全面恢复关系的关键条件。

**Burma Frees 46 Prisoners**

Burmese state media say 46 prisoners have been freed as part of a general amnesty aimed at promoting "national unity."

The state-run New Light of Myanmar says 37 men and nine women were freed Tuesday, under an order by President Thein Sein. It also says 34 foreign prisoners were deported.

But, it does not mention whether those released were among the hundreds of political prisoners still jailed by Burma's military-backed government.

Burma has released hundreds of political prisoners since a nominally civilian government came to power last year.

In response, many Western governments have begun relaxing sanctions against Burma. But the unconditional release of all remaining political prisoners remains a key condition for many to fully restore ties with Burma.
