**奥巴马罗姆尼在关键州旗鼓相当 **

决定由谁担任下届美国总统的持久而激烈的选战终于即将落幕，奥巴马总统和他的共和党竞争对手罗姆尼星期一将分别到几个州做最后冲刺，民调显示两人目前的支持率几乎不相上下。

在美国50个州中，俄亥俄、佛罗里达、威斯康辛、维吉尼亚、科罗拉多和艾奥华等几个州的选情胶着。小州新罕布什尔和这六个州一样，两位候选人在星期二的选举中都不占有明显优势。

星期一，现任总统奥巴马将返回威斯康辛、艾奥华和俄亥俄等州，进行竞选活动，随后将前往他的家乡芝加哥，并于选举夜在那里停留。

共和党总统候选人罗姆尼星期一上午将前往佛罗里达州，然后再到维吉尼亚、俄亥俄和新罕布什尔等州。他将在马萨诸塞州的波士顿度过选举夜。

在星期二的选举中，除选出总统外，选民们还将选举所有435名美国国会众议员和100名美国国会参议员中的33名。分析人士一般认为，共和党将继续保持在众议院的多数地位，而奥巴马总统的民主党则可能继续维持在参议院的微弱多数。

** Obama, Romney Tied In Key States **

The long, hard-fought campaign to be president of the United States for the next four years finally comes to an end with the two viable candidates visiting several states Monday for one last attempt to break what polls indicate is a nearly deadlocked race.

Only a handful of the country's 50 states are considered to be virtually tied, led by Ohio, Florida and Wisconsin, along with Virginia, Colorado and Iowa. The small state of New Hampshire joins those six as states where neither candidate is considered to have a clear lead ahead of Tuesday's election.

On Monday, incumbent President Barack Obama returns to Wisconsin, Iowa and Ohio to hold political events, before heading to his hometown of Chicago, ((Illinois)) where he will be on election night.

Republican challenger Mitt Romney's agenda for Monday includes a morning stop in Florida before trips back to Virginia, Ohio and New Hampshire. He will spend election night in Boston, in his home state of Massachusetts.

Along with the race for president, all 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and 33 of the 100 Senate seats are being contested in Tuesday's election. Analysts generally say Republicans will continue to hold their majority in the House, while members of the president's Democratic party could maintain their slim majority in the Senate.

** US Soldier to Appear in Court for Afghan Massacre **

A U.S. Army soldier accused of an Afghan village massacre is due to appear in a military courtroom Monday, where prosecutors will for the first time lay out their case against him.

Staff Sergeant Robert Bales, who is 39 years old and the father of two, is alleged to have walked out of his southern Afghanistan military base under the cover of darkness March 11, gunning down 16 people, including nine children, in nearby villages. Some of the bodies were set afire.

U.S. forces have paid compensation to families of the dead and to those wounded in the attack.
