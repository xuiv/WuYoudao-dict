**中国经济增长率第三季度降至7.4%**

中国经济今年第三季度的增长率为7.4%，没有达到政府的预定目标，而且是自全球金融危机爆发以来的最低点。

中国国家统计局星期四发布的数据显示，作为世界第二大经济体的中国连续第七个季度经济增长速度下降。

虽然7.4%的经济增长率在很多经济衰退国家会被视为增长强劲，但在中国则是低速增长，几十年来，中国经济平均年增长率为10%。

然而，中国总理温家宝仍然持乐观态度，认为中国经济增长率今年能达到7.5%的目标。温家宝星期三说，中国经济正在趋于稳定，而且在以往三个月内相对良好。

**China's Economy Slows to 7.4 Percent in Q3**

China's economy grew by 7.4 percent in the third quarter, missing the government's target and falling to its slowest rate of growth since the global financial crisis.

The figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Thursday represent the seventh straight quarter of easing for the world's second largest economy.

Although 7.4 percent growth would be considered strong in many recession-struck countries, the figure is low for China, which has averaged annual growth rates of 10 percent for decades.

But Premier Wen Jabot is still optimistic China can reach its target of 7.5 percent growth for this year, saying on Wednesday the economy is stabilizing and has been "relatively good" the past three months.

**前美国驻华大使洪博培称北京取消其入境签证**

前美国驻中国大使洪博培说，他原计划上月到中国发表一次演讲，但由于他以往谈论人权问题，北京取消了他的入境签证。

洪博培星期三接受“外交政策研究所”采访时说，中国下月开始敏感的权力交接，这很可能是中共领导人禁止他入境的原因。中国方面没有对此正式发表评论。

洪博培从2009年至2011年任美国驻华大使。他说，中国领导人知道他“在人权和美国价值观方面说得太多”。洪博培表示，中国领导人不想让前美国大使说出一些话，使得他们不得不进行反驳。

洪博培2011年4月辞去驻华大使职务，以角逐美国共和党总统候选人的提名，但未获成功。他有时以不同寻常的坦率态度批评中国的人权记录。

** Former US Ambassador to China Says His Visa Was Denied by Beijing**

Former U.S. Ambassador to China Jon Huntsman says Beijing cancelled a visa for him to visit the country last month to give a speech because of his record of bringing up human rights.

In a Wednesday interview with Foreign Policy, Huntsman said China's sensitive leadership transition that begins next month is likely the reason China's Communist leaders barred his visit. There has been no official Chinese comment.

Huntsman, who served as ambassador from 2009 until 2011, said Chinese leaders know that he "talks too much about human rights and American values." He said they "didn't want the former ambassador saying stuff that might create a narrative that they would have to fight."

The Mandarin-speaking Huntsman, who resigned as ambassador in April 2011 to unsuccessfully attempt a run at the Republican nomination for president, was at times an unusually outspoken critic of China's human rights record.
