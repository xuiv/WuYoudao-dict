**日本首相野田佳彦欢迎美国将重心转向亚太**

星期二，日本首相野田佳彦在柬埔寨召开的一次地区峰会期间会晤了美国总统奥巴马，他警告说，亚太地区的安全局势正在恶化。

野田佳彦对奥巴马说，他欢迎华盛顿近来将重心转向亚太地区，目前中国与包括日本在内的几个美国盟国之间的领土纠纷日趋激化。

奥巴马说，这次会晤是证实美日两国“特殊的盟友关系”的又一个机会。

华盛顿否认在中国与其他国家的主权争端中偏袒任何一方，但北京怀疑美国将重心转向亚太地区是为了遏制中国的发展。

奥巴马与野田佳彦公开谈话以及随后会晤中国总理温家宝时，都没有提及领土争端问题。

**During Meeting With Obama, Japan's Noda Welcomes US 'Pivot'**

Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned of a worsening security situation in the Asia-Pacific, as he met with U.S. President Barack Obama Tuesday on the sidelines of a regional summit in Cambodia.

Prime Minister Noda told President Obama that he welcomes Washington's recent "pivot" toward the region, which comes amid worsening territorial disputes between China and several U.S. allies, including Tokyo.

President Obama said the meeting was another opportunity to affirm what he called the "extraordinary alliance" between the U.S. and Japan.

Washington denies taking sides in the sovereignty disputes between China and its rival claimants, though Beijing suspects the U.S. rebalance toward the region is aimed at containing its rise.

President Obama did not mention the territorial disputes in his public remarks with Mr. Noda, or in his later meeting with outgoing Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao.

**美国国务卿克林顿前往中东争取化解以巴冲突**

美国总统奥巴马派遣国务卿希拉里·克林顿前往以色列、拉马拉和开罗，在以色列与加沙地带巴勒斯坦激进分子的越界冲突进入第七天之际会晤地区领导人。

克林顿星期二将启程前往耶路撒冷，会晤以色列总理内塔尼亚胡。此外，克林顿此行期间还将会晤巴勒斯坦领导人和埃及官员。白宫说，克林顿这次中东之行的重点在于和平解决这场冲突符合美国的利益。

到目前为止，外交活动没有能够制止以巴之间的越界袭击。星期一晚间，联合国安理会就有关局势举行了一次会议，但未能达成一致立场。

与此同时，加沙城内冒起浓烟，以色列继续对哈马斯激进分子发动空袭，激进分子则一直向以色列居民区发射火箭弹。

有关官员说，这场冲突已经造成100多名巴勒斯坦人和3名以色列人死亡。

联合国秘书长潘基文星期二呼吁立即停火。潘基文星期一抵达开罗，为调停努力提供支持。

**Israel Pounds Gaza as Clinton Plans Mid East Diplomacy Trip**

U.S. President Barack Obama is sending Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to Israel, Ramallah and Cairo to meet with regional leaders as the cross border conflict between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza enters its seventh day.

Clinton is leaving Tuesday to go to Jerusalem, where she will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. She will also meet with Palestinian leaders and Egyptian officials on the trip, which the White House says will focus on U.S interest in a peaceful outcome to the conflict.

Diplomacy has so-far failed to stop the cross-border attacks, with the latest U.N. Security Council meeting on the situation ending late Monday without reaching an agreement.

Meanwhile, smoke is rising from Gaza City Tuesday as Israel pushed ahead with its air campaign against Hamas militants, who have been firing rockets toward Israeli communities.

Officials say the death toll has risen to more than 100 Palestinians and three Israelis.

United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on Tuesday for an immediate cease-fire. He arrived in Cairo Monday to support mediation efforts.
