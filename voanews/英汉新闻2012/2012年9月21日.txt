**王立军案星期一宣判**

中国将于星期一宣判重庆前公安局长王立军案件。王立军案件引发的政治丑闻曾震撼中共，打垮了高级官员薄熙来。

成都的法院官员星期五公布了这个宣判日期。王立军是在本星期早些时候以涉嫌徇私枉法、叛逃、滥用职权和受贿犯罪的罪名接受审判的。

王立军在今年2月逃入美国驻成都总领事馆，他告诉美国外交官，薄熙来的妻子谷开来因为商业纠纷杀害了一名英国商人。后来谷开来被判杀人罪，而薄熙来失去了一切党内职务。

官方的新华社说，王立军在两天的庭审中没有对检方的指控提出异议。这次庭审经过了严密组织，也不对外国媒体开放。观察人士说，王立军大概在所有罪名上都被判有罪。

** Ex-Police Chief in China Scandal to Receive Verdict Monday**
China will announce a judgement on Monday in the case against an ex-police chief who set off a political scandal that riled the Communist Party and brought down top politician Bo Xilai.

Court officials in the central city of Chengdu on Friday announced the verdict date for Wang Lijun, who was tried earlier this week on charges of defection, abuse of power, bribe-taking, and bending the law for selfish ends.

Wang fled to the U.S. consulate in Chengdu in February, where he told American diplomats that Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, had murdered a British businessman over a business dispute. Gu was later convicted of the murder, while Bo was stripped of his party posts.

The official Xinhua news agency says Wang did not object to the charges during the tightly-orchestrated two-day trial, which was closed to foreign media. Observers say Wang is likely to be found guilty on all charges.

** Aung San Suu Kyi Seeks Support From Burmese Diaspora**

Burma's democratic leader Aung San Suu Kyi has called on the Burmese community in the United States to support the democratic movement in their native land.

The Nobel Laureate on Thursday addressed her compatriots, including a group of Buddhist monks, at American University in Washington. She said:" In this day and age there are very, very few happy endings and very few success stories. So much seems to be happening that is disappointing, that is disillusioning all around the world. I want Burma to be the exception."

Earlier Thursday, Aung San Suu Kyi urged human-rights activists to continue their efforts aimed at ending the plight of political prisoners. She told members of the Amnesty International rights group and other supporters in Washington that hatred and fear often prompt officials to detain individuals with different viewpoints.

Burma's opposition leader spent 14 years in detention under Burma's former military rulers, and is on a 17-day U.S. visit that marks her first trip to America since being freed from house arrest in 2010.

Wednesday, she received the Congressional Gold Medal in a ceremony attended by the U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and leading lawmakers in Washington. Afterwards she met privately with President Barack Obama at the White House.
