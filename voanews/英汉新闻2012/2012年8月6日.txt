**7 Killed in US Sikh Temple Shooting**

Authorities in the northern U.S. state of Wisconsin say a shooting at a Sikh temple Sunday morning in the city of Oak Creek, in the suburbs of Milwaukee, left seven people dead, including the gunman. Three people were wounded in the attack.

Police have described the suspect as a white male in his 40s, but have given no details or mentioned a possible motive. The local police chief said an officer exchanged fire with the gunman outside the temple and killed him.

Sunday evening, law enforcement officers extended their investigation of the shooting to a neighborhood in nearby Cudahy. They surrounded a duplex and evacuated several homes.

Officials say the Federal Bureau of Investigation is involved in the investigation because the shooting might be an act of domestic terrorism.

President Barack Obama said he was "deeply saddened" to learn of the shooting. He called the governor of Wisconsin, the mayor of the town and the trustee of the Sikh temple to express his condolences.

The Indian embassy in Washington says it has dispatched an Indian diplomat to visit the temple.

Syrian state media say a bomb has exploded at the state television building in Damascus, wounding several people.

The station remained on the air Monday following the blast, which ripped through the third floor of the building.

Syrian opposition activists are reporting continued attacks by government forces in the northern city of Aleppo Monday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the army is shelling several neighborhoods in Aleppo, and that at least two civilians have been killed.

The country's biggest city has become a key battleground in the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad's rule, as government forces are reported to have massed for what is expected to be a strong offensive against the opposition.

Meanwhile, U.S. senators John McCain, Joseph Lieberman and Lindsey Graham say the United States should provide direct assistance to the opposition, including weapons, intelligence and training.
