**克林顿 表示美国正采取大胆措施保护外交人员**

美国国务卿克林顿表示，美国正在采取大胆的步骤保护在全世界各地的美国外交人员。目前，抗议一部在美国制作的反穆斯林影片的示威活动在继续蔓延之中。

星期二，克林顿说，美国官员正在审核每个岗位的安全情况；如有需要，将进一步增加安全措施。

国务卿克林顿说，对于上个星期发生的对利比亚班加西的美国领馆的攻击事件是否是事先策划的，或是事先知道即将发生，美国国务院没有任何可以采取行动的情报。克林顿表示，利比亚政府正在协助美国调查人员进行调查；不把那些在幕后操纵袭击事件的人揪出来并绳之以法，美国誓不罢休。

星期二，抗议那部反穆斯林影片的示威活动蔓延到泰国、巴基斯坦西北部以及印控克什米尔地区。基地组织北非分支威胁要袭击在阿尔及利亚、突尼斯、摩洛哥和毛里塔尼亚的美国外交人员。

** Clinton Says US Taking Aggressive Steps to Protect Diplomats**

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton says the United States is taking aggressive steps to protect diplomats worldwide, as protests against an anti-Islam film produced in the United States spread.

Clinton said Tuesday that officials are reviewing security at every post and adding to it when necessary.

The secretary said the State Department had no actionable intelligence that last week's attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya was planned or imminent. U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other diplomats were killed. Clinton said the Libyan government is helping American investigators and that the United States will not rest until those behind the attack are found and punished.

Protests against the anti-Islam film spread to Thailand, northwest Pakistan and Indian-controlled Kashmir Tuesday. Al-Qaida's North Africa branch threatened to attack U.S. diplomats in Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, and Mauritania.

**帕内塔会见正在等待成为中国最高领导人的习近平**

正在等待成为中国最高领导人的习近平会见了到访的美国国防部长帕内塔，这是习近平从公众视野中神秘失踪十几天以来第一次会见外国贵宾。

习近平和帕内塔星期三在北京人民大会堂握手和拍照的时候，看来习近平身体健康，轻松自如。

再过一些星期，中共领导层就要交班换届了，在这敏感时期，59岁的习近平近来有两个星期没有从事公开活动，直到上星期六才公开露面，官方没有说明原因。这引起外界对他健康情况的揣测。

星期三，面带微笑、精力充沛的习近平说，他希望帕内塔的访问将有助于推动中美两国之间和两军之间的关系。

帕内塔正在从事为期一周的亚洲之旅。他告诉习近平，他期待加强美中这两个太平洋大国之间的安全关系，并且改善双方的对话。

美中两国的国防部长星期二举行了一整天的会晤。帕内塔说，扩大军事联系是防止华盛顿和北京之间发生对抗的关键因素。过去双方都对对方在亚太地区扩展势力越来越有疑虑。

美国国防部长访华之际，正值中国和美国的盟国日本就东中国海上的一组岛屿发生激烈的领土争端。帕内塔敦促双方保持克制，他重申华盛顿不在这场争端中选边站的立场。

但是中共中央机关报旗下的环球时报星期四表示，华盛顿显然偏向日本。这家经常反映官方思想的报纸说，北京应该利用帕内塔来访的机会让美国知道，中国将采取一切必要手段来包围自己的岛屿。中国人把该岛屿称作钓鱼岛，日本人称作尖阁诸岛。

星期二中国各地发生的激烈的反日示威，也部分地针对美国。美国国务院声明说，在美国驻北京大使馆外面，大约50名示威者包围了美国驻华大使骆家辉的汽车，汽车有轻微损伤。声明还说，骆家辉没有受伤，那些抗议者被中国安全人员驱散。

** Panetta Meets With China's Leader-in-Waiting**

China's leader-in-waiting Xi Jinping has met with U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, in the first public meeting with a visiting foreign dignitary since his mysterious disappearance from public life.

Xi appeared healthy and relaxed as he shook hands with Panetta and posed for photographs in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing Wednesday.

The 59-year-old had not been seen in public for two weeks before re-emerging Saturday. The unexplained absence, which came just weeks before a sensitive political transition, led to speculation about Xi's health.

On Wednesday, a smiling and energetic Xi said he hoped Panetta's visit will help advance "state-to-state and military-to-military" ties between Washington and Beijing.

Panetta, who is on a week-long tour of Asia, told Xi he looked forward to promoting security ties and improving dialogue between the two "great Pacific nations."

During Tuesday meetings with his Chinese counterpart, Panetta said greater military ties are key to avoiding confrontation between Washington and Beijing, who have grown suspicious of each other's expanding roles in the Asia-Pacific.

The Pentagon chief's visit comes as China and Japan, an American ally, are involved in a bitter territorial dispute about a group of islands in the East China Sea. Panetta urged both sides to exercise restraint and repeated Washington's insistence that it does not take sides in the dispute.

But an article in the Communist Party-controlled Global Times on Wednesday says it is "obvious" that Washington is partial to Japan. The newspaper, which often reflects official thinking, says Beijing should use Panetta's visit to let the United States know it will take all necessary steps to safeguard the islands, known in Chinese as Diaoyu and in Japanese as Senkaku.

Boisterous anti-Japan protests that spread across China on Tuesday were also partly focused on the United States. The U.S. State Department issued a statement that a car carrying U.S. Ambassador to China Gary Locke was mildly damaged after about 50 protesters surrounded it outside the U.S. embassy in Beijing. The statement says the ambassador was not hurt and the protesters were dispersed by Chinese security personnel.
