**俄罗斯敦促叙利亚政府与反对派对话**

俄罗斯敦促叙利亚政府履行承诺，与反对派进行谈判。俄罗斯正在为争取结束叙利亚21个月冲突加紧进行外交努力。

俄罗斯外交部长拉夫罗夫星期五说，他在本星期早些时候的会谈中敦促叙利亚高级官员展示就撟罟惴旱囊樘鈹进行讨论的意愿。

俄罗斯一直是叙利亚总统阿萨德的坚定支持者，但近几个星期看来开始对叙利亚政府在冲突中的作用失去耐心，这场冲突已经导致大约4万5千人死亡。

星期五早些时候，俄罗斯外交部副部长波格达诺夫对俄罗斯国际文传通讯社说，莫斯科已经向叙利亚全国联盟发出会谈邀请。很多国家已经承认这个主要的叙利亚流亡反对派组织是叙利亚人民的合法代表。

Russia Urges Syria to Dialogue with Opposition

Russia is urging the Syrian government to follow through on its pledge to hold talks with the opposition, as Moscow intensifies diplomatic efforts to bring an end to 21 months of conflict in Syria.

Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Friday he urged senior Syrian officials during meetings earlier this week to demonstrate they are open to discussing the "widest possible range of issues."

Russia has been a staunch defender of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, but has in recent weeks seemingly grown impatient with the government's role in the conflict that has left an estimated 45,000 people dead.

Earlier Friday, Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov told the RIA Novosti news agency Moscow has sent an invitation for talks to the Syrian National Council, the main exiled opposition group recognized by many as the legitimate government of Syria.


**中国要求网络用户实名登记**

中国官方通讯社报道，政府通过要求网民实名注册加强了对互联网用户的控制。

官方的新华社说，历时五天的全国人大常委会在星期五的闭幕会议上通过了这项措施。

中国官方说，这项规定是为了加强保护网络用户的个人信息，并打击垃圾邮件等滥用行为。然而，实名登记制还将限制人们在网上举报官员腐败和滥用职权，这些举报通常是匿名进行的。

中国境内很多网络用户使用“虚拟个人网络”(VPN)登陆被中国审查人员封锁的网站。不过，在北京的咨询商、同时担任斯坦福大学商学研究生院高级顾问的邓肯·克拉克对美国之音记者贝蒂说，中国当局也在限制人们获取VPN的途径，这可能会伤害到公司企业。

克拉克说：“一方面，我们有很多跨国公司，包括那些想要走向全球的中国跨国公司，它们必须能够登陆境外网站并以安全方式交换数据。可是，我们还有一些中小型企业，它们利用计算机云技术或者谷歌的Google Drive这样的途径来获取财务共享或者账单共享等软件。而一旦这条途径被封，人们就转向这些VPN，而如果VPN也不灵了，那你就倒霉了。”

北京推动商务或教育性的互联网使用，但禁止被视为具有颠覆性的内容，并封锁了许多网站。


China Requires Real-Name Internet Registration

China's official news agency says the government has tightened controls on Internet users by enacting rules requiring them to register their real names.

The state Xinhua news agency said lawmakers approved the measures Friday at the closing meeting of a five-day session of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

Beijing says the regulation is aimed at protecting the personal information of Web users and cracking down on abuses such as junk e-mail.

However real-name registration will also curtail people's ability to report, often anonymously, corruption and official abuses.

Many Internet users in China have turned to so-called virtual private networks (VPNs) to gain access to websites that are otherwise blocked by China's Internet censorship, but Duncan Clark, a Beijing-based consultant who is also a senior adviser to Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, tells VOA's Victor Beattie Chinese authorities are limiting access to those, too, and that could hurt business:

"On the one hand we have a lot of multi-national companies who depend on, and that includes Chinese multi-nationals who are trying to go global, who depend on access to sites outside and secure ways of exchanging data. But also we have a number of small to medium size enterprises who use cloud computing or things like Google Drive to access say you know shared accounting or invoicing software, and once that's blocked, of course people have been shifting to these VPNs, but if the VPNs aren't working, then you're out of luck."

Beijing promotes Internet use for business and education but bans material deemed subversive and blocks many Web sites.
