**中国领导人祝贺奥巴马总统连任成功**

中国领导人向美国总统奥巴马发出贺电,祝贺他连任成功。

即便北京本星期正在把注意力转向中国自己的领导层交接，但是中国的共产党领导人还是对美国总统奥巴马连任成功表示祝贺。

中国外交部发言人洪磊对记者说，胡锦涛主席和即将接任的习近平副主席，期待和奥巴马总统合作推进中美关系。

洪磊说：“正如胡主席在贺电中指出，近四年来，在双方共同努力下，中美关系取得了积极进展。保持中美关系持续健康稳定发展，符合两国人民的根本利益，也有利于亚太地区乃至世界的和平、稳定与发展。中方愿与美方一道，放眼未来，继续努力，推动中美合作伙伴关系建设取得更大的进展，更好造福两国人民和世界人民。”

中国领导人之前并没有公开表态支持奥巴马或他的共和党挑战者罗姆尼。奥巴马和罗姆尼在竞选期间都曾誓言，一旦当选将对中国采取强硬立场。

新华社在星期二发布的一篇评论中表示，希望随着美国总统竞选的落幕，结束两位候选人“拿中国说事的游戏”。

一篇刊登在另外一份中国共产党控制的报纸《环球时报》上的文章则批评美式选举的缺点。这篇评论表示，中国人民应该“提防民主所带来的民粹主义”。文章说，美国的政治人物更感兴趣的是赢得选票，而不是服务人民。

美国这次大选在中共18大之前举行，正好凸显出中国非常不同的政治权力交接。在幕后操作的神秘的18大，将于星期四在戒备森严的首都北京开幕。

18大期间，胡锦涛将把其共产党总书记职位传给副主席习近平。习近平将于明年初接掌未来十年的中国国家主席职位。

中国共产党一名发言人星期三表示，党的18大将于星期四上午开始，到11月14日结束。

**China Congratulates Obama on Election Victory**

China's Communist leaders have congratulated U.S. President Barack Obama on his re-election victory, even as Beijing turns its focus toward its own political transition that gets underway this week.

Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hong Lei told reporters that President Hu Jintao and his soon-to-be-successor, Vice President Xi Jinping, look forward to working with Mr. Obama to advance Sino-American relations.

"Maintaining a steady, healthy and stable development of China-U.S. relations serves the fundamental interests of the two countries and the two peoples as well as peace, stability and development of the Asia Pacific region and beyond. China is ready to work with the U.S. side, look to the future and make continuous efforts for fresh and greater progress in the building of China-U.S. cooperative partnership and deliver greater benefits to the two peoples and people of the world."

China's leaders did not publicly support either Mr. Obama or his Republican challenger Mitt Romney, both of whom vowed during the campaign to get tough on China if elected.

An editorial in the official Xinhua news agency on Tuesday expressed hope that the end of the campaign would also bring an end to what it called the "China-bashing game" of each candidate.

Another article in the Communist Party-controlled Global Times lectured Washington on the shortcomings of its electoral process. The editorial says Chinese citizens should "be wary of populism led by democracy," warning that U.S. politicians are more interested in winning votes than working for the people.

The timing of the U.S. election has highlighted China's very different political transition. The secretive, behind-the-scenes process begins Thursday with the 18th Party Congress in the heavily guarded capital, Beijing.

During the meeting, President Hu Jintao is set to transfer the position of secretary general of the Communist Party to Vice President Xi Jinping. Mr. Xi will take over early next year as president for the next decade.

A party spokesperson said Wednesday that the congress will begin early Thursday and last until November 14th.

**中国人模拟投票体验美国大选程序**

大约200名中国人星期三在美国驻北京大使馆参加了模拟投票，体验美国选举过程。而一天之后，也就是星期四，中国将开始一个全然不同的权力交接程序。

参加这次活动的中国人大都投票支持奥巴马总统，而不是他的竞争对手罗姆尼。按照传统，每次美国总统大选投票的时候，美国驻北京大使馆都会举行一个观看大选的聚会。大约600人参加了今年的聚会，其中100人参加了模拟投票。

美国驻北京大使馆的发言人对美国之音说，这项活动是为了向包括中国人在内的外国人介绍美国的选举程序。活动安排在美国大选投票日11月6日。一天之后，中共中央将在北京举行十八大。这是一次闭门会议，会议将产生中共中央下一届领导人。

参加模拟投票的许多人都注意到美国大选与僵硬的、非民主化的中国领导层权力移交这两者之间的不同。他们对外国记者说，希望他们有一天能够选择自己的领导人。

茶国家网 Tea Leaf Nation 的编辑 Rachel 鲁告诉美国之音，中国网民也在网上表示更喜欢美国的选举程序。茶国家网主要是监督中国的社交网站。

她说，在投票前的24小时内，新浪网上就有大约300万条有关选举的微博。新浪微博是中国最大的社交网站。

她说，中国的微博大都欢迎奥巴马连任。她例举了新浪微博所作的一个并不科学的调查，调查显示，75%接受调查的人支持现任总统奥巴马。

但是她说，中国的政治程序并没有引起广大网民的热情，很多网民觉得自己和国家政治程序没有什么关系。

皮尤研究中心上星期进行的一次调查显示，在一党执政的中国，超过半数的人口对美国的民主理念持积极看法。

**Chinese Get Taste of U.S. Electoral Process With Mock Vote**

About 200 Chinese citizens got a taste of the U.S. electoral process when they took part in a mock vote hosted by the U.S. Embassy in Beijing on Wednesday, just a day before China begins its own very different handover of power.

Chinese voters at the event overhwelmingly voted for President Barack Obama over his Republican rival Mitt Romney. The voters were part of a larger group of about 600 guests who attended the election-watching party that has become a tradition at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.

A U.S. embassy spokesperson told VOA the event was meant to teach foreigners, including Chinese, about the details of the American electoral process. The event was held to coincide with the November 6th U.S. election. The mock vote occurred just one day before the 18th Party Congress in Beijing -- a secretive meeting that will usher in China's next generation of Communist leaders.

Many of the mock voters did not ignore the contrast between the U.S. election and the rigid, non-democratic Chinese leadership transition, telling foreign reporters they wish to be able to someday choose their own leaders in China.

Rachel Lu, the editor of Tea Leaf Nation, a website that monitors Chinese social media, tells VOA that Chinese web users are also expressing their preference for the U.S. electoral process online.

"(They) expressed a lot of admiration for the electoral process in the U.S. and the fact that people can exercise their right to vote. We just wrote an article on this on our website and quoted someone who tweeted that he actually felt happy that Obama was elected, but that he had no similar feelings about the 18th Party Congress."

Lu says more than 3 million U.S. election-related microblog messages were posted on Sina Weibo, China's largest social media outlet, in a 24-hour period leading up to the vote.

She said Mr. Obama's re-election was well-received on Chinese microblogs, citing an unscientific survey by Sina Weibo that found more than 75 percent of respondents supporting the incumbent U.S. president.

But she said the Chinese political process has failed to generate similar excitement among many web users, saying that many feel disconnected from the country's political process.

A survey last month for Pew Research Center suggests more than half of the people in the single-party state have a positive opinion of American ideas about democracy.
