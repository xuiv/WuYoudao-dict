*New Somali Parliament to Hold First Session *

Somalia's new parliament begins its work Monday, as the country moves closer to completing a complex plan to establish a stable, permanent government.

A selection committee has named about 220 lawmakers for the 275-seat body, but officials say that is enough for the parliament to convene.

The lawmakers are expected to vote for a new Somali president within the coming days.

Monday is the deadline for the election of a speaker of parliament and a president under a United Nations-backed roadmap to end the country's 8-year transitional government.

U.N. officials and international partners issued a joint statement Sunday, saying Somalia has an "unprecedented opportunity for greater peace and stability."

*South African Mine Owner Warns Striking Workers to Return *

The owner of a South African mine where police killed 34 people last week says striking workers must return to the job Monday or face being fired.

Lonmin PLC said in a statement Sunday that the deadline is a "final ultimatum."

About 3,000 people have joined the strike since August 10 to demand higher wages.

The protest turned violent last Thursday when police opened fire on striking workers. The national police chief says police forces shot in self-defense.

President Jacob Zuma has ordered a national week of mourning beginning Monday to remember the lives of all South Africans who died violently.
