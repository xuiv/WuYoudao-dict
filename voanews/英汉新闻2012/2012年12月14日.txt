**朝鲜誓言要发射更多卫星**

朝鲜领导人金正恩誓言要将更多卫星送入太空。几天前，朝鲜刚刚成功试射远程火箭，引发国际谴责。

官方朝中社说，金正恩强调了继续发射卫星以“发展朝鲜的科学、技术和经济”的必要性。

联合国安理会谴责朝鲜星期三的发射是“明显违反”禁止平壤进行导弹或核试验的制裁。

朝鲜数以十万计的朝鲜民众和军人星期五举行集会，庆祝朝鲜成功发射卫星。

**North Korea Vows More Satellite Launches**

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is vowing to send more satellites to space, just days after the country's successful long-range rocket launch provoked international condemnation.

The official Korean Central News Agency said that Mr. Kim "stressed the need" to continue the satellite launches "to develop the country's science, technology, and economy."

The United Nations Security Council condemned Wednesday's launch as a "clear violation" of sanctions barring Pyongyang from carrying out missile or nuclear tests.

But in North Korea hundreds of thousands of civilians and soldiers gathered Friday to celebrate the success of the mission.

**俄罗斯否认改变叙利亚政策**

俄罗斯外交部说，莫斯科的叙利亚政策没有改变。此前媒体援引一名俄罗斯高级外交官的话说，叙利亚反政府武装可能会打败总统阿萨德。

俄罗斯外交部星期五说，过去几天来，副外长波丹诺夫没有就叙利亚问题发表任何声明，也没接受任何记者的专访。

星期四，俄罗斯媒体引述这位副外长的话说，阿萨德正逐渐失去对国家的控制，不能排除反对派取得最终胜利的可能性。这个说法被解读为，叙利亚的这个强大盟友首次承认，叙利亚政府在接近两年的打击反政府武装的交战中已经开始崩溃。

但是俄罗斯外交部说，波丹诺夫所指的是叙利亚反对派及其外国支持者所预测的他们迅速战胜大马士革政权的说法。俄罗斯外交部说，波丹诺夫是对讨论中东和北非问题的克里姆林宫一个顾问团说这番话的。

莫斯科和北京曾不断阻止联合国安理会解决叙利亚危机的努力。

**Russia Denies Change in Stance on Syria **

Russia's foreign ministry says Moscow's policy on Syria has not changed, after a top diplomat was quoted as saying Syria's opposition may win its battles against President Bashar al-Assad.

The ministry, on Friday, said Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov had not made any statements or conducted "special interviews" with journalists over the past few days regarding Syria.

On Thursday, Russian media quoted him as saying Mr. Assad was increasingly losing control of his country's territory, and that an opposition victory could not be ruled out. It was seen as the first time Russia, a powerful Syrian ally, had acknowledged the Syrian government was beginning to crumble in its nearly two-year battle against anti-government forces.

But Russia's foreign ministry said Bogdanov was referring to the claims of the ``Syrian opposition and its foreign sponsors forecasting their quick victory over the regime in Damascus." It said Bogdanov made the remark to a Kremlin advisory body that was discussing issues in the Middle East and North Africa.

Moscow and Beijing have repeatedly blocked efforts by the United Nations Security Council to address the Syrian crisis.
