**昂山素季将探望缅甸铜矿抗议民众**

星期四黎明前，缅甸安全部队突袭西北偏远地区一座有争议的铜矿外面搭起帐篷的抗议者，对他们发射催泪弹和水炮。

美国之音缅甸语组记者报道说，乘坐卡车的警察于当地时间凌晨3点进入莱比塘矿区，拆除并焚烧帐篷，至少七名村民被打伤，其中包括几名佛教僧侣。

缅甸当局下令停止持续10天的抗议，而数百名缅甸村民和僧侣对此不予理会。抗议者反对扩建蒙育瓦镇附近的一座铜矿。当局开始镇压后，很多抗议者逃到附近一个村庄避难，同时考虑下一步的行动。

星期四，缅甸反对派领袖昂山素季将前往该地区，倾听抗议者的诉求。

分析人士说，得到中国资助的这座铜矿的扩建项目耗资10亿美元，将带来环境、社会和健康等方面的问题。他们还指责当局为实施这一项目而非法侵占土地。

**Aung San Suu Kyi to Visit Mine Protesters**

Burmese security forces fired tear gas and water cannons in a pre-dawn raid against protesters camped outside a controversial copper mine in a remote area of northwest Burma on Thursday.

A reporter for the VOA Burmese Service says at least seven villagers, including several monks, were injured after truckloads of police moved in to dismantle and burn the camps at the Letpadaung mine around 3 a.m. local time.

Hundreds of villagers had defied government orders to end the 10-day protest against the expansion of the copper mine located near the town of Monywa. Following the crackdown, many fled to a nearby village for refuge and to contemplate their next move.

Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi is set to visit the area Thursday to hear protesters' grievances.

Activists say the $1 billion expansion of the China-backed mine will cause environmental, social and health problems. They also accuse authorities of unlawfully seizing land for the project.

**埃及总统穆尔西将对全国发表讲话**

埃及总统穆尔西计划星期四向全国发表讲话。与此同时，一个处于分裂状态的委员会将就宪法草案进行表决，而该委员会遭到基督徒和自由派人士的抵制。

穆尔西将起草宪法的最后期限从今年12月推迟到明年2月，但埃及议会议长说，没有必要延长时间。批评人士说，由伊斯兰主义者主导的宪法起草委员会迅速完成宪法起草工作可能使目前的政治动乱更趋恶化。自从穆尔西11月22号发布有关禁止司法机构挑战总统决定的政令以来，埃及陷于政治动乱状态。

埃及民众连续第七天在开罗解放广场举行示威，指责穆尔西的做法像独裁者。投掷石块的抗议者与发射催泪弹的警察继续发生冲突，一直持续到深夜。

穆尔西的支持者誓言在星期六举行示威。

星期三，埃及最高法院停止办公，以抗议穆尔西颁布的政令，并誓言最高法院将一直停止运作，直到宪法法院对穆尔西有关将自己凌驾于司法监督之上的权力做出裁决。

** Egypt President To Address Nation**

Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi plans to address the nation Thursday, as a divisive panel boycotted by Christians and liberals was set to vote on a draft constitution.

Mr. Morsi extended the deadline to write the constitution from December to February, but the assembly's speaker said the extra time was unnecessary. Critics say the Islamist-dominated panel's move to finish the constitution quickly could worsen the political turmoil that has gripped the nation since Mr. Morsi issued a November 22 decree barring the judiciary from challenging his decisions.

Egyptians continued protests in Tahrir Square against President Morsi for a seventh straight day, accusing him of acting like a dictator. Clashes between stone-throwing protesters and police launching tear gas canisters also continued overnight.

Supporters of the president have vowed to demonstrate on Saturday.

Egypt's highest courts went on strike Wednesday in protest of the president's decrees, vowing to stop their work until the a constitutional court rules on Mr. Morsi's order granting himself immunity from judicial review.
