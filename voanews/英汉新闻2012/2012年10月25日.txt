**奥巴马顾问批罗姆尼对中国说硬话不负责任**

美国共和党总统候选人罗姆尼曾经承诺，他如果当选总统，上任第一天就会将中国列为货币操纵国。奥巴马总统的一位外交政策顾问表示，这是不负责任的表现，并会威胁到美中关系。

星期三在约翰斯.霍普金斯大学举行的辩论会上，奥巴马总统的前任高级亚洲政策顾问巴德说，如果罗姆尼在北京权力交接的敏感时期采取这一行动将会“令人震惊”。中国的18大将在美国大选两天后举行。

巴德目前效力于奥巴马总统竞选连任委员会。他说，中共新领导人不会消极对待美国的威胁，不会被逼到没有退路的角落。他说，他可以肯定，中国领导人会进行报复。

罗姆尼竞选班子的国家安全事务顾问弗里德伯格表示，美国不应该因为害怕世界上两个最大的经济体爆发贸易战而“陷入瘫痪”。他坚称，将中国列为货币操纵国不会导致世界末日，因为中国对美国的依赖大于美国对中国的依赖。

Obama Aide Slams Romney's Tough Talk on China as 'Irresponsible'

A foreign policy adviser to President Barack Obama says Republican candidate Mitt Romney's pledge to label China a currency manipulator on his first day in office is irresponsible and risks upsetting U.S.-China relations.

At a debate Wednesday at Johns Hopkins University, Mr. Obama's former senior Asia policy aide Jeff Bader said it is "astonishing" Mr. Romney would take the step during Beijing's sensitive leadership transition, which begins two days after the November 6 election.

Bader, who serves on the president's re-election committee, said China's new Communist Party leaders will "not be in a passive mood for threats and being backed into corners." He said he guarantees they will "retaliate."

Romney campaign national security adviser Aaron Friedberg said the U.S. should not "be paralyzed" because of fears of sparking a trade war between the world's two largest economies. He insists the move would not "trigger Armageddon," arguing that "China is more dependent on the United States than we are on them."


**说话大胆的东京都知事石原辞职组建新政党**


东京都知事石原慎太郎表示，他将辞去他的职务，并将在日本大选前组建新的政党。石原直言不讳的民族主义经常激怒邻国中国。

石原星期四在记者会上说，他计划竞选国会议员。日本国会选举必须在8月底之前举行。石原曾经代表自由民主党担任过国会议员，后来担任了日本最大都市东京都知事将近14年。

今年80岁的石原从政前是一位作家，是日本著名的极右派政治人物。他的极右派观点包括反对日本二战后的和平宪法。

今年早些时候，石原威胁要购买并开发一个日本和中国都声称拥有主权的群岛，让中国大为光火。分析人士认为，石原的做法迫使野田佳彦首相将其中一些岛屿国有化，导致中日关系的严重恶化。

Tokyo's Fiery Governor Quits to Form New Party

Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara, whose outspoken nationalism has often angered neighboring China, says he is resigning to form a new political party ahead of a general election.

Ishihara told a news conference Thursday he plans to run for parliament in the elections, which must be called by August. He was a parliamentarian for the Liberal Democratic Party before serving nearly 14 years as governor of Japan's largest city.

The 80-year-old novelist-turned-politician is known for his far-right political views, including his opposition to Japan's pacifist World War II-era constitution.

Earlier this year, he angered Beijing by threatening to buy and develop a group of islands claimed by both Japan and China. Analysts say the move forced Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda to nationalize some of the islands, which led to a serious deterioration in China-Japan relations.
