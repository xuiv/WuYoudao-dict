**Obama Meets with Aung San Suu Kyi in Rangoon**

U.S. President Barack Obama has met with Burmese President Thein Sein and democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi in the country's main city of Rangoon, in the first visit to the country by a serving U.S. president.

After an hour-long meeting Monday, Mr. Obama, with President Thein Sein at his side, told reporters that the process of democratic and economic reform in the Southeast Asian nation can lead to incredible development opportunities. He added that he is looking forward to visiting again "sometime in the future."

Mr. Obama later met with Aung San Suu Kyi, the nation's leading democracy activist, at her home in Rangoon. The two Nobel Peace laureates held a news conference after the meeting, and Mr. Obama told reporters he has seen encouraging signs in the country in the past year, including Aung San Suu Kyi's release from house arrest and her election to parliament.

However, the Burmese democracy leader warned about the risk of what she called a "mirage of success." She said the most difficult time in any transition is when the people think success is in sight.

Mr. Obama delivers a speech at the University of Rangoon before traveling on to Cambodia for meetings with Southeast Asian leaders at the annual ASEAN summit.

President Obama has said his trip to Burma does not represent an endorsement of the government, but is rather an acknowledgement of the political reform process under way in the country.

The president said there has been a stated commitment to further political reform in Burma, which he says deserves encouragement.

He said the goal of his visit is to highlight the progress that has been made, and also to address the steps Burma needs to take in the future.

Mr. Obama spoke in Bangkok during a news conference with Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra Sunday. Thailand was the first stop on a three-nation Asian visit in his first overseas trip since winning re-election nearly two weeks ago.

自从上一轮谈判于2002年破裂以来，双方的首轮和谈上月在挪威正式启动。

哥伦比亚政府官员说，他们希望在几个月、而不是几年内与反政府武装力量达成一项协议。

有报道说，谈判代表们的主要议题是五点日程，即土地改革、签订和平协议后反政府武装的潜在政治权益、非法毒品交易、解除武装以及对冲突受难者的赔偿。

** Colombia, FARC Seek End to Conflict **

Colombia and the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, sit down together Monday in Havana for talks aimed at ending Latin America's longest running insurgency.

The peace talks, the first since the last round of negotiations collapsed in 2002, formally began last month in Norway.

Colombian government officials say they want to reach an agreement with the rebels in a matter of months, not years.

Negotiators are reported to be focusing on a five-point agenda - land reform, the potential political rights of the rebel group once a peace agenda is signed, the illegal drug trade, disarmament, and compensation for conflict victims.
