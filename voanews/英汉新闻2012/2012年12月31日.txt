华盛顿 — **美国议员将就财政悬崖问题做最后一刻谈判**

美国国会议员们星期一将继续开会，就避免财政悬崖进行最后一刻的谈判。所谓“财政悬崖”，就是从明年1月1号开始生效的大幅增税和削减开支。

任何协议都很可能首先在参议院获得通过。参议院在中午前开始举行会议，此前于星期天进行了广泛的讨论，但几乎没有取得任何进展。

美国副总统拜登与参议院少数党领袖麦康奈尔进行了谈判，与此同时，民主党人和共和党人试图解决彼此之间围绕富人增税以及削减联邦政府开支问题的分歧。

参议院多数党领袖里德星期天说，双方存在重大分歧，而麦康奈尔则表示，主要问题在于议员们是否具有达成协议的意愿、兴趣和勇气。

如果民主党控制的参议院表决通过一项妥协方案，该方案还需要在共和党控制的众议院获得通过。随后，奥巴马总统就可以在星期一晚间签署，以避免星期二自动开始对几乎所有美国人增税。

**US Lawmakers Hold Last-Minute Fiscal Talks**

U.S. lawmakers reconvene Monday for last-minute talks to avoid the so-called "fiscal cliff" of sharp tax increases and spending cuts that would take effect January 1.

Any agreement would likely first pass through the Senate, which goes into session just before midday, after extensive talks Sunday yielded little progress.

Vice President Joe Biden held negotiations with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, as Democrats and Republicans tried to resolve their differences over tax rates for the rich and federal spending cuts.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Sunday the divide was "significant," while McConnell said the sticking point appeared to be "a willingness, an interest or courage" among lawmakers to arrive at an agreement.

If the Democrat-controlled Senate votes for a compromise deal, the Republican-led House would have to approve the measure. The president could then sign it late Monday, avoiding having automatic tax increases on nearly all Americans kick in Tuesday.

**卜拉希米:如无外交努力叙利亚明年或有10万人丧生**

国际和平特使卜拉希米警告说，除非世界各强国迫使叙利亚政府和反政府武装组织进行谈判来结束持续21个月的冲突，否则明年可能有10万叙利亚人丧生。

卜拉希米星期天在开罗发表讲话时说，尽管他最近加紧外交努力，推进世界和地区强国6月在日内瓦达成的一项和平方案，叙利亚冲突双方并未进行对话。联合国-阿盟特使卜拉希米说，需要外界的帮助才能展开基于这项和平方案的叙利亚全国对话。

卜拉希米说，叙利亚局势正在恶化，如果内战继续下去，叙利亚可能成为由军阀统治的索马里式国家。

日内瓦和平方案呼吁叙利亚各方结束敌对行动，展开全国对话，并组建一个过渡政府来安排新的选举。这项方案没有涉及阿萨德总统的命运，看来这一点阻碍了和平方案的实施。

** Brahimi: Without Diplomacy, Syria Conflict May Kill 100,000**

International peace envoy Lakhdar Brahimi has warned 100,000 people could die in Syria in the next year unless world powers press the Syrian government and rebels to negotiate an end to their 21-month conflict.

Speaking Sunday in Cairo, Brahimi said the warring sides are not speaking to each other, despite his recent intensified diplomatic efforts to promote a peace plan approved by world and regional powers last June in Geneva. The U.N.-Arab League envoy said "help is needed from the outside" to start a Syrian national dialogue based on that plan.

The Brahimi says the situation in Syria is deteriorating and if the civil war continues, Syria will turn into a Somalia-style failed state ruled by warlords.

The Geneva plan calls for all sides in Syria to end hostilities, enter a national dialogue, and form a transitional government leading to new elections. It says nothing about the fate of President Bashar al-Assad, an omission that appears to have stalled its progress.
