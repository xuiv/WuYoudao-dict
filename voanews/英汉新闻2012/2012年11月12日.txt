**Karzai in India to Push for Investment **

Afghan President Hamid Karzai is in India where he held talks Monday with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to appeal for increased investment in war-torn Afghanistan.

Indian officials say Mr. Karzai and Mr. Singh will review a strategic partnership agreement their two countries signed last year designed to deepen security and economic ties. India has already invested more than $2 billion dollars on Afghanistan's infrastructure.

Before holding talks in New Delhi with Mr. Singh Monday, President Karzai met with other high-level Indian officials and visited Mahatma Gandhi's memorial.

**温和派叙利亚教长哈提卜任反对派联盟领袖**

叙利亚反对派组织选举温和派教长哈提卜为新联盟的首位领袖。新联盟团结了为结束阿萨德总统统治而战的各不同反对派系。

哈提卜曾经是大马士革乌马亚德清真寺的教长。在他今年离开叙利亚之前，曾因批评阿萨德的统治而数次入狱。

星期天，反对派成员还在多哈推选企业家里亚德-赛义夫和著名女性活动人士苏海尔-阿塔西为联盟副主席。

赛义夫提出了美国支持的计划，即建立一个包括叙利亚境内外反对派系的统一组织。在美国外交官和卡塔尔官员的压力下，叙利亚反对派人士努力团结起来。从去年起义开始以来，美国和阿盟都一直支持叙利亚反对派的活动。

美国国务院星期天晚间发表声明说，在团结一致的叙利亚反对派努力结束阿萨德血腥统治以及争取叙利亚的和平民主未来的过程中，美国愿意提供支持。

星期天在多哈达成协议之前，叙利亚全国委员会在阿拉伯联盟和西方的压力下，同意组建一个接纳一直不愿与叙利亚全国委员会为伍的各反对派的新机构。叙利亚全国委员会曾被认为是反对派的主要代表。

**Moderate Syrian Cleric to Lead Opposition**

Syrian opposition groups have elected a moderate cleric, Maath al-Khatib, to lead a new coalition uniting the disparate factions fighting to oust President Bashar al-Assad.

Khatib is a former imam at the Umayyad mosque in Damascus and was imprisoned several times for criticizing Mr. Assad's rule before leaving Syria this year.

Opposition members also voted Sunday in Doha to elect businessman Riad Seif and well-known female activist Suhair al-Attasi as vice presidents.

Seif proposed the U.S.-backed initiative to establish an umbrella organization for the opposition both inside Syria and abroad. Anti-Assad figures had struggled to achieve unity under pressure from U.S. diplomats and officials from Qatar, which have supported Syrian opposition activity since an uprising began last year.

The U.S. State Department said in a statement late Sunday that it looks forward to supporting the united opposition as it works "toward the end of Assad's bloody rule" and a peaceful, democratic future in Syria.

The agreement Sunday came after the group formerly seen as the main representative of the opposition, the Syrian National Council, heeded Arab and Western pressure to agree to a new structure embracing those who had been unwilling to join its ranks.
