**叙利亚政府军轰炸大马士革35人丧生**

叙利亚政府军再次在首都大马士革展开攻势，至少35人死于地面炮火和空袭。

设在英国的叙利亚人权了望台对美国之音说，星期三的死亡事件都发生在反政府武装活动的大马士革南部城区。

当地居民说，这次炮轰和空袭在政府军再次向反政力量控制地区发动的攻势中是最猛烈的军事行动之一。居民说，上个月在残酷的军事攻势下离开大马士革的反政府武装先前曾开始返回当地。

在纽约，联合国政治事务负责人费尔特曼对安理会说，联合国对叙利亚急剧恶化的人道局势越来越感到忧虑。他表示，大约250万人需要人道救援，同时叙利亚流离失所的人以及逃往邻国的叙利亚人都在增加。

联合国紧急救援事务协调员阿莫斯上星期曾前往叙利亚。她说，联合国各机构上月为82万多叙利亚人提供了食品。阿莫斯还表示，自从她上次于3月访问叙利亚以来，叙利亚的人道局势更趋恶化。

** Syrian Forces Shell Damascus, 35 Killed**

Syrian government forces have renewed their attacks in the capital, Damascus, killing at least 35 people in a campaign of shelling and artillery fire.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told VOA that Wednesday's deaths occurred in southern districts where anti-government rebels operate.

Residents said the shelling and aerial bombardment were some of the fiercest since the army reasserted control over the opposition neighborhoods. They said rebels who left the city last month during a brutal army campaign had started to return.

In New York, United Nations political chief Jeffrey Feltman told the Security Council the U.N. views the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation in Syria "with growing alarm." He said about 2.5 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance while the number of displaced people in Syria and the flow of refugees to neighboring countries is growing.

The U.N. emergency relief coordinator, Valerie Amos, who was in Syria last week, said U.N. agencies last month provided food for more than 820,000 people across Syria. She said the humanitarian situation there has worsened since a previous visit in March.

**联合国秘书长将访问伊朗**

联合国秘书长潘基文计划下星期前往伊朗，出席不结盟国家的一次会议，同时美国和以色列都对此表示反对，认为潘基文的访问将发出一个错误的信息。

潘基文的发言人内西尔基星期三宣布了潘基文将前往伊朗的消息。他说，潘基文将传达国际社会对伊朗核项目、恐怖主义、人权以及叙利亚危机等问题的关注。

内西尔基说，潘基文了解此行的敏感性质，但如果拒绝出访，就将错过一个机会。

美国表示，担心伊朗会利用主持这次拥有120个成员国的不结盟运动峰会的机会，转移对其失败的注意力。

**UN Chief to Visit Iran**

United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon plans to travel to Iran next week for a meeting of non-aligned nations, amid objections from the United States and Israel which say the visit sends a bad signal.

Mr. Ban's spokesman, Martin Nesirky, announced the trip Wednesday. He says the U.N. chief will convey the international community's concerns and expectations about Iran's nuclear program, terrorism, human rights and the crisis in Syria.

Nesirky says Mr. Ban is aware of the sensitive nature of his visit, but that boycotting would be a "missed opportunity."

The United States says it is concerned Iran will use its turn to host the 120-member group to "deflect attention from its own failings."
