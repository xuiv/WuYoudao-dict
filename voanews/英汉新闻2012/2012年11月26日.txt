**中国战机首次完成在航母降落**

中国官方媒体说，中国海军首次成功地完成了在航母上的战机降落，这是中国军事和经济实力不断增强的最新迹象。

中国官方媒体星期天说，中国自行研制的舰载机歼-15上星期在辽宁号航母上完成了几次降落。报道说，战机还成功地从舰上起飞。

一名资深中国军事问题研究人员对中国日报说，舰载机日间起降是中国海军发展中国第一艘航母辽宁号作战能力的一个“里程碑”。

但这位专家表示，必须进行更多测试，歼-15才能用于实战。他说，歼-15飞行员还没有在夜间或复杂情况下做过起降。

中国1998年从乌克兰购买了这艘前苏联海军未建造完成的航母，并用了数年的时间重新装备。这艘被命名为辽宁号的中国航母今年9月25日开始服役。

** China Lands Fighter Jet on Aircraft Carrier for First Time**

Chinese state media say the country's navy has successfully landed a fighter jet on an aircraft carrier for the first time, in the latest sign of China's growing military and economic power.

In reports published Sunday, state-run news agencies said the navy landed several Chinese-made J-15 jets on the carrier Liaoning in the past week. The reports said the warplanes also took off successfully.

A senior Chinese military researcher told the China Daily newspaper that the daytime landings and take-offs are a "landmark" in the navy's efforts to develop the combat capability of the Liaoning, China's first aircraft carrier.

But this researcher also said more tests must be done before the carrier-based J-15 jets are ready for combat. He said the J-15 pilots have not yet performed landings and take-offs at night or in complex situations.

China bought the vessel as an unfinished Soviet aircraft carrier from Ukraine in 1998 and spent years refurbishing it. The Liaoning entered military service on September 25.

**联合国气候变化会议重点讨论京都议定书及新的全球气候协议**

来自将近200个国家的代表开始举行为期两天的会议，旨在就如何限制温室效应气体排放量达成协议。

各国代表在卡塔尔城市多哈举行联合国气候变化会议，重点在于解决京都议定书延长期效问题。京都议定书将在今年期满失效，该议定书规定发达国家要将温室效应气体排放量从上世纪90年代水平削减5%。

美国和中国等温室效应气体排放大国没有签署京都议定书，而俄罗斯、日本和加拿大表示，不打算签署延长期效的京都议定书。这将使延长期效的京都议定书只涵盖全球温室效应气体排放量的大约15%。

本次会议还将讨论制定一项新的全球气候协议，该协议将在2015年最后敲定，于2020年生效。

**UN Climate Talks Focus on Kyoto, New Global Pact**
Representatives from nearly 200 nations have begun two weeks of talks aimed at agreements on how to limit greenhouse gas emissions.

Delegates at the U.N. climate change conference in Doha, Qatar will chiefly tackle extending the Kyoto Protocol. The pact, which expires this year, binds developed countries to cut emissions by 5 percent below 1990 levels.

Major greenhouse gas emitters like the United States and China are not part of the deal, while Russia, Japan and Canada say they do not want to be part of an extension to the Kyoto agreement. That would leave only about 15 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions covered under a continuation of the pact.

The conference will also include talks on crafting a new global climate deal that would be finalized by 2015 and go into effect in 2020.
