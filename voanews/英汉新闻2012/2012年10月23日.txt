**叙利亚停火前景渺茫**

叙利亚政府军星期二继续发动攻势，与反叛力量作战激烈进行。看来本星期穆斯林节日期间实现停火的希望越来越渺茫。

叙利亚反政府组织人权了望台表示，叙利亚政府军的战斗机袭击了北部城市阿勒颇的居民区。与此同时，据报道，反政府武装在几个地方同时与政府军作战。

人权了望台说，一名反政府武装人员在阿勒颇的战斗中丧生。法新社报道说，至少有两名反叛力量人员在大马士革郊外的战斗中丧生。有报道说，首都大马士革听到枪声。

据报道，在东部的代尔祖尔省和南部的德拉省也发生了战斗。

Scant Hopes for Cease-fire in Syria

Government attacks and fierce fighting continued in Syria Tuesday as hopes grew slimmer for a cease-fire during this week's Muslim holiday.

The opposition Syrian Observatory of Human Rights said that Syrian warplanes raided a neighborhood in the northern city of Aleppo and rebels forces were reported battling government forces in several parts of the country.

The Observatory said one rebel was killed in fighting in Aleppo and the French News Agency said at least two rebels were killed in skirmishes outside Damascus. There were reports of gunfire in the capital.

Clashes were also reported in the eastern province of Deir Ezzor and in Daraa, southern Syria.


**奥巴马罗姆尼就中国贸易行为激辩**

美国总统奥巴马与共和党挑战者罗姆尼利用在佛罗里达举行的外交政策辩论的机会对中国表达了强硬立场。

奥巴马总统把中国描述为“对手”，但是他说，只要中国遵守国际贸易规则，他就会和这个崛起的亚洲大国合作。

他说：“中国是个对手，但如果它遵守规则，也是国际社会中的潜在合作伙伴。所以我当时上任时的态度是，我们要坚持让中国像任何国家一样遵守同样的规则。”

奥巴马说，他的政府提出的有关中国违反贸易规则的投诉案比前两届政府加起来的都要多。

在竞选期间一直对中国说硬话的罗姆尼在辩论中说，北京“不是非要成为对手”，但他警告说，中国不能“从我们身上压过去并偷走我们的就业机会”。

罗姆尼说：“我年复一年地看到公司关门、人们丢掉自己的工作，原因是中国没有遵守同样的规则，包括人为压低本国货币的币值。这压低了他们的产品的价格，使我们的产品减少竞争性，让我们损失就业机会。这种现象一定要止住。”

罗姆尼重申，他上任第一天就要宣布中国是货币操纵国。如果这样定性，美国将对中国产品施加高额关税。

这次辩论有15分钟的小节专门讨论“中国的崛起与明日之世界”。在这一小节中，两位候选人都没有谈到中国的人权问题、不断加剧的海事纠纷以及即将展开的中共权力交接。

Obama, Romney Tangle over China's Trade Practices

U.S. President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger Mitt Romney used a foreign policy debate Monday in ((the southeastern state of)) Florida to get tough on China.
President Obama described China as an "adversary" but said he looked forward to partnering with the rising Asian power as long as it follows international trade rules.

"China's an adversary, and also a potential partner in the international community if it's following the rules. So my attitude coming into office was that we are going to insist that China plays by the same rules as everybody else."

Mr. Obama said his administration has brought more trade violation cases against China than the previous administration did in two terms.

Mr. Romney, who has used harsh rhetoric on China throughout the campaign, said Beijing "doesn't have to be an adversary," but warned that it cannot "roll all over us and steal our jobs."

"I've watched year in and year out as companies have shut down and people have lost their jobs because China has not played by the same rules, in part by holding down artificially the value of their currency. It holds down the prices of their goods. It means our goods aren't as competitive and we lose jobs. That's got to end."

Mr. Romney repeated his promise to label China a currency manipulator on his first day in office, a designation that would allow for steeper tariffs on Chinese goods.

During the 15-minute segment set aside for discussing "The Rise of China and Tomorrow's World," neither candidate mentioned China's human rights situation, intensifying maritime disputes, or upcoming leadership transition.
