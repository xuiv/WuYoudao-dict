据报从7月底至8月中旬，几个地方发生至少四起事件，几名外国记者遭到攻击，他们的设备被没收，并被强制拘留。

*Report: Foreign Journalists Beaten, Harassed in China*

A group of foreign journalists is complaining about a recent series of threats, harassment and beatings against international news reporters working in China.

In a statement Tuesday, the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China (FCCC) says it is alarmed by the nature and frequency of the incidents, some of which are reported to have involved state security forces.

Several international journalists are said to have been assaulted, had equipment confiscated and been forcibly detained during at least four separate incidents in various locations from late July until mid-August.

The Beijing-based FCCC, along with its sister organizations in Hong Kong and Shanghai, says the incidents represent a "clear risk of serious physical harm to journalists merely carrying out there professional duties in China."

Foreign journalists have long complained of official interference in their reporting in the Communist country, where local authorities have attempted to retain tight control of the flow of information.
