**飓风过后美国总统竞选开足马力**

美国总统奥巴马在战场州“科罗拉多州”对支持者说，美国人民在危机时刻团结一致，他指的是本星期早些时候的桑迪飓风和火灾侵袭以及科罗拉多州今年早些时候发生的枪击屠杀事件。

经过几天处理桑迪风暴事宜后，奥巴马恢复了竞选活动，他星期四说，无论前进还是遇到挫折，美国人民都是团结一致的。

奥巴马还说，他不怕做出不受欢迎的选择，例如他就任总统几个月后采取政府救助汽车工业的举措。

奥巴马的共和党竞选对手、前麻萨诸塞州州长罗姆尼星期四在维吉尼亚州进行竞选活动，该州也是11月6号选举中一个至关重要的州。

罗姆尼在罗阿诺克对支持者说，美国中产家庭在奥巴马第一个四年总统任期内受到财政“挤压”。罗姆尼说，人们的收入水平下降，同时汽油价格和健康保险等必需费用都在上升。

星期四，纽约市长布隆伯格表示支持奥巴马连任。布隆伯格最初是共和党人，后来变成独立派人士。布隆伯格赞扬奥巴马为解决汽车和工厂产生的污染问题做出努力。很多科学家说，二氧化碳的排放导致全球气候变暖，并可能催生出更多威力巨大的象飓风桑迪这样的大风暴。

** US Presidential Race Back at Full Speed After Superstorm **


U.S. President Barack Obama has told supporters in the "battleground state" of Colorado that Americans unify during times of crisis, referencing the onslaught of Hurricane Sandy earlier this week and a mass shooting that took place in Colorado earlier this year.

Having resumed campaigning after several days off to deal with storm recovery, Mr. Obama said Thursday in Boulder that America rises or falls as "one nation, one people."

He also said he is not afraid to make unpopular choices, such as the government bailout for the auto industry during the early months of his presidency.

Mr. Obama's Republican rival, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, campained in Virginia Thursday, another crucial state in the November 6 election.

Mr. Romney told supporters in Roanoke that middle income Americans have been "squeezed" financially during Mr. Obama's first term in office. He says incomes have dropped while necessities such as gasoline and health insurance have gone up.

Thursday, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Mr. Obama for a second term. The mayor, a former Republican turned Independent, cited the president's efforts to fight pollution from cars and factories. Many scientists say carbon emissions contribute to global warming and possibly more powerful storms like Sandy.

**桑迪飓风死亡人数增加 纽约马拉松如期举行**

侵袭美国东部沿海地区的桑迪飓风在美国造成的死亡人数超过了90人，而且随着紧急工作人员在遭受洪灾和火灾破坏的街区搜寻，死亡人数还在增加，但纽约市长布隆伯格说，纽约将于星期天举办世界知名的年度马拉松比赛。

警方说，桑迪飓风在纽约市和新泽西州造成至少59人死亡。

但纽约市长布隆伯格保证，星期天的马拉松比赛将如期举行。他说，由于比赛时间是在星期天，街道上车辆较少，因此不会给警方造成过大负担。这项著名的赛事吸引着众多选手和观众，并为纽约带来巨额收入，如果取消赛事，将给已经遭受打击商家造成更大压力。

下曼哈顿和周边街道的大部分地区仍然停电。当地电力公司表示，几天后才能全面恢复供电。

桑迪飓风过后，关闭四天的纽约地铁和公车系统部分恢复运营。

目前紧急工作人员正在从隧道和建筑中排水，同时纽约市区和郊区努力从飓风打击下恢复过来。为了避免交通拥挤，乘坐人员少于三人的汽车不准进城。

纽约当局警告人们不要在市内河流及水湾游泳，以避免接触受到污染的水。


**Hurricane Death Toll Rising, NYC Marathon Still On**

The U.S. death toll from the powerful storm that ravaged the East Coast is above 90 and rising, as emergency workers canvass flood- and fire-ravaged neighborhoods, but New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg says the city will carry on Sunday with its annual, world-famous marathon.

Police say at least 59 people were killed as Sandy pummeled New York City and New Jersey.

But Mayor Bloomberg vowed that Sunday's event will go on as scheduled. He said the event should not overtax the police department because it is on a Sunday, when there is less street traffic. Canceling could also put more strain on already-strapped business owners, as the prestigious event draws thousands of runners and spectators, and millions of dollars, to the city.

Power is still out in much of lower Manhattan and surrounding boroughs. The local electricity company says it will be several more days before the grid is fully up and running again.

Subways and buses resumed limited service Thursday after a four-day shutdown.

Emergency workers are pumping out flooded tunnels and buildings as the city and its suburbs struggle to recover. To avoid traffic gridlock, cars with fewer than three people inside are not allowed into the city.

Schools remain closed, and hundreds of thousands still have no electricity -- a major hardship in a city where many live in high-rise apartment buildings with electric elevators.

New York authorities are warning people against swimming or boating in the city's rivers and bays to avoid polluted water.
