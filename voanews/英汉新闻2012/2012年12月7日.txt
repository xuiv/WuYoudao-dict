**朝鲜火箭试射可能因大雪而延迟**

一个美国智囊机构说，朝鲜为计划中的火箭试射所进行的准备工作可能由于大雪天气而延迟。

美国约翰•霍普金斯大学的美韩研究所星期五说，新的卫星图片显示，西海卫星发射场的准备工作进度“比以前报道的进度要慢”。

卫星图片分析专家汉森在美韩研究所的网站上写道，星期二拍摄的卫星图片显示，西海卫星发射场积雪很深，而雪上没有痕迹。

但汉森指出，尽管受到天气的拖延，朝鲜仍可能按预定计划完成准备工作。

** North Korea Rocket Launch Possibly Delayed by Snow**

An American think tank says North Korea's preparations for a planned rocket launch may have been delayed by heavy snow.

The US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University said Friday that new satellite imagery suggests preparations at the Sohai satellite launch station are proceeding "more slowly than previously reported."

Nick Hansen, an expert on imagery analysis, wrote on the institute's website that images taken on Tuesday showed no tracks in heavy snow at the launch site.

However, Hansen said that, even with weather delays, the North could finish its preparations on schedule.

**以色列军人开枪打死一名巴勒斯坦人**

以色列在加沙地带边界地区开枪，造成一名巴勒斯坦人死亡，自从以色列和哈马斯激进分子停止持续八天的致命冲突以来，这是第一次有人死亡。

巴勒斯坦医疗机构官员说，安瓦尔•克德伊赫星期五和一些巴勒斯坦人走进边界围栏时中弹身亡，在枪击中还有几人受伤。路透社援引克德伊赫一名亲属的话说，他当时试图把一面哈马斯旗帜插在边界围栏上。

以色列说，当一些人走进以色列边界时，以色列军人向空中鸣枪示警。目前哈马斯激进分子还没有做出反应。

埃及斡旋达成的停火于星期三晚间开始生效后，平静局势保持了一天多之际，发生了这起暴力事件。

加沙地带的哈马斯行政首脑赞扬当地各派激进组织遵守停火协议。

以色列总理内塔尼亚胡说，以色列政府“给停火一个机会”，但也为停火可能破裂做好了准备。

**Israeli Gunfire Kills Palestinian**

Israeli gunfire at the Gaza Strip border has killed a Palestinian--the first death since a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas militants halted eight days of deadly fighting.

Palestinian medical officials say Anwar Qdeih was shot as he approached the border fence Friday with a group of Palestinians. Several others were wounded in the violence. Reuters news agency quotes a relative of Qdeih as saying he was trying to place a Hamas flag on the fence.

Israel said troops fired warning shots in the air when a group approached the Israeli border. There was no immediate reaction from Hamas militants.

The violence comes amid more than a day of quiet skies, after an Egyptian-brokered truce went into effect late Wednesday.

Gaza's Hamas prime minister hailed the territory's multiple militant groups for respecting the cease-fire.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his government was "giving the truce a chance," but was prepared for its possible collapse.
