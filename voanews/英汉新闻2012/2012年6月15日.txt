**克林顿：金正恩如实行改革将载入史册**

美国国务卿希拉里·克林顿说，朝鲜新领导人金正恩如果帮助本国人民摆脱贫困和孤立，他的名字就将载入史册。

克林顿星期四说，希望29岁的金正恩会选择把朝鲜带入21世纪，并希望他把金钱用于粮食、教育和医疗保健，而不是用于战争武器。

克林顿表示，她相信朝鲜最终会改变，因为人民不能生活在压制之下，他们死于饥饿，被投入集中营，基本人权遭到剥夺。

金正恩在他的父亲金正日死后，于去年12月成为朝鲜领导人。

西方对金正恩几乎一无所知。到目前为止，金正恩没有显示出会给予朝鲜人民更多自由或放弃核武器项目。

** Clinton: North Korea's Kim Could Go Down in History if He Allows Change **


U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton says North Korea's new leader Kim Jong-un could go down in history if he helps his people emerge from poverty and isolation.

She said she hopes the 29-year-old Kim will choose to bring the North into the 21st century and spend money on food, education, and health care instead of implements of war.

Clinton said she believes North Korea will eventually change because people cannot live under oppressive conditions where they are starved to death, thrown into gulags, and have their basic human rights denied.

Kim Jong-un took over as North Korean leader in December, after the death of his father, Kim Jong-il.

The West knows almost nothing about the young Kim, who so far has shown little inclination to grant North Koreans more freedom or end the country's nuclear weapons program.

**法院裁定给埃及蒙上了困扰的阴云**

埃及前总统穆巴拉克任命的法官们解散了议会，并准许曾在穆巴拉克政府中担任总理的沙菲克参加总统决选。此后，埃及民众准备星期五举行抗议活动。

埃及最高宪法法院星期四做出以上裁决后，立即遭到穆斯林兄弟会高层人士的指责，他们说，这种裁决相当于让忠于穆巴拉克政府的人掌握权力。

埃及媒体援引军方统治者的话说，穆斯林兄弟会候选人穆尔西与沙菲克的决选将按照预定安排，在星期六开始举行。

穆尔西星期四说，他尊重最高宪法法院的裁决。但他对埃及电视台说，最高宪法法院的裁决推翻了人民议会上个月通过的一项禁止前穆巴拉克政府官员竞选公职的法律，他对此感到不满。


**Court Ruling Casts Cloud of Confusion over Egypt**

Egypt is bracing for protests Friday after judges appointed by former President Hosni Mubarak dissolved the parliament and allowed his former prime minister to compete in a presidential run-off election.

The ruling by Egypt's Supreme Constitutional Court was immediately denounced Thursday by senior Muslim Brotherhood officials, who said it amounted to a power grab by those loyal to the Mubarak government .

Egypt's interim military rulers were quoted in state media as saying the run-off between Mohamed Morsi and Ahmed Shafiq will begin as scheduled on Saturday.

Morsi said Thursday he respects the ruling. But he told Egyptian television that he was dissatisfied with the court's decision to strike down a law passed by parliament last month barring former Mubarak officials from running for office.
