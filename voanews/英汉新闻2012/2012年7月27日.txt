**罗姆尼评论伦敦奥运准备工作引发反弹**

星期四，美国总统候选人罗姆尼试图挽回他所做评论的影响，他发表的这一评论似乎是质疑英国主办奥运的能力。

星期三，罗姆尼抵达英国首都伦敦的几小时后，美国全国广播公司播放了对他的采访报导。罗姆尼在接受采访时说，在奥运开幕前的最后时刻，伦敦安保力量的情况令人不安。

但是，罗姆尼星期四会晤英国首相卡梅伦等官员后表示，他期待伦敦奥运获得极大成功，但完全不出错误是不可能的。

卡梅伦为伦敦筹备奥运的能力进行辩护，并声称在一个不为人所知的地方举办奥运的难度小于在伦敦举办奥运。卡梅伦显然是在暗指2002年犹他冬季奥运，罗姆尼是那届奥运的经办人。

罗姆尼预定将出席星期五在伦敦举行的奥运会的开幕式，然后将前往以色列和波兰访问
** Romney Responds to Olympics Comments on Overseas Tour**

U.S. presidential candidate Mitt Romney tried to backtrack Thursday from comments he made that seemed to question Britain's ability to host the Olympic Games.

Within hours of his arrival in the British capital Wednesday, NBC News aired an interview wih Romeny in which he said that last-minute concerns over London's security staffing for the games were "disconcerting."

But after meeting with top British officials including Prime Minister David Cameron Thursday, Romney said he expected the games to be "highly successful" and that it was "impossible for absolutely no mistakes to occur."

Mr. Cameron had defended London's preparations and said it was easier to hold the Olympics "in the middle of nowhere" than in London. The comment was apparently in reference to the 2002 Olympics in ((the U.S. state of)) Utah, which Romney managed.

Romney is expected to attend Friday's opening ceremonies for the Olympics. He then travels to Israel and Poland.
