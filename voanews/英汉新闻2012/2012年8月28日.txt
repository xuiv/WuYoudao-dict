**哥伦比亚政府与反政府武装展开新一轮和谈**

哥伦比亚总统桑托斯说，他已经开始与主要反政府武装组织“哥伦比亚革命武装力量”展开谈判，争取结束持续将近50年的内战。

桑托斯星期一发表全国电视讲话，宣布与哥伦比亚革命武装力量展开和平谈判。媒体星期一早些时候说，双方同意今年10月在挪威首都奥斯陆举行会谈。

桑托斯说，谈判必须达成一项和平协议，而军事行动在谈判期间将继续进行。桑托斯还说，哥伦比亚第二大反政府武装“民族解放军”表示了参加谈判的意愿。

哥伦比亚革命武装力量还没有对桑托斯的宣布做出反应。

哥伦比亚政府与哥伦比亚革命武装力量的上次谈判在2002年破裂，当时游击组织哥伦比亚革命武装力量扩充人员，并开始从事毒品走私活动。

**Colombian Government, Rebels to Begin New Round of Peace Talks **

Colombia's president says he has begun negotiations with the country's main rebel group to bring an end to nearly five decades of war.

Juan Manuel Santos announced the peace talks with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, better known as FARC, during a nationally televised address Monday. News outlets reported earlier Monday that the the two sides had agreed to begin holding talks in Oslo, Norway, in October.

Mr. Santos says the negotiations must lead to a peace deal and that military operations will continue during the talks. He also mentioned that Colombia's second-biggest rebel group, the National Liberation Army, or ELN, has expressed a desire to participate in the negotiations.

FARC has yet to react to the Santos announcement.

The last negotiations between the government and FARC collapsed in 2002, as the guerillas increased their ranks and turned to drug trafficking.

**阿富汗坎大哈发生致命汽车炸弹爆炸**

一枚汽车炸弹在阿富汗第二大城市坎大哈爆炸，造成至少一人死亡，至少14人受伤。

坎大哈当局说，星期一汽车炸弹爆炸的袭击目标看来是坎大哈警察局长拉扎克，他当时正驾驶汽车经过现场，但没有受伤。

在发生这次炸弹袭击之前，阿富汗南部官员说，塔利班叛乱分子将17名阿富汗平民斩首，其中包括两名妇女。阿富汗内政部长说，这些平民是星期天晚间在赫尔曼德省的卡贾基地区遇害的。

关于这起杀戮事件的起因有着不同的说法。阿富汗官员早些时候说，塔利班叛乱分子不容□c唱歌跳舞，因此袭击了晚间举行的聚会。但赫尔曼德省省长说，两名塔利班指挥官为争夺两名妇女而长期不和，这可能是袭击杀害的原因。

*Deadly Car Bomb Rocks Kandahar *

A car bomb has exploded in Afghanistan's second-largest city, Kandahar, killing at least one person and wounding at least 14 others.

Local authorities say Monday's car bomb appeared to target Kandahar's police chief, Abdul Razaq, who was driving by in his car at the time of the attack. He escaped unhurt.

The attack comes after officials in southern Afghanistan said Taliban insurgents beheaded 17 Afghan civilians, including two women. Afghanistan's Interior Ministry says the civilians were killed late Sunday in the Kajaki district of Helmand province.

There are conflicting reports about the reasons for the killings. Earlier, Afghan officials said the Taliban attacked a late-night party because insurgents disapprove of music and dancing. But Helmand's governor said the killings followed a long-standing feud between two Taliban commanders over the two women.
