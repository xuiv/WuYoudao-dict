**Eastern US Braces for 'Superstorm'**

Forecasters say conditions along the east coast of the United States will
deteriorate Monday as one of the biggest storms ever to hit the mainland
brings heavy rain and wind to a large section of the nation's most populated
region.

Hurricane Sandy has been moving up the coast and is expected to join with
two winter storm systems, creating a hybrid "superstorm" that could affect
up to 60 million residents. It is expected to make landfall late Monday.

Forecasters expect the storm to bring hurricane-force winds to portions
of the coast from Virginia to Massachusetts. The National Weather Service
is predicting a "life-threatening" storm surge that could reach more than
3 meters in New York Harbor.

The storm has forced major cities including Washington, Philadelphia and
New York to close schools and shut down their public transit systems. U.S.
stock markets are closed Monday, and the United Nations has canceled meetings
and closed its offices.

**韩国活动人士用气球向朝鲜发送传单**

韩国活动人士用气球越境向朝鲜发送了数万份反对平壤当局的传单，一星期前，首
尔曾对活动人士发出警告，同时平壤也曾扬言进行报复。

星期一，十多名活动人士把5万份传单装在七个气球上，随后气球飘过分隔朝鲜半岛
南北两方的非军事区。当地一些居民担心朝鲜当局会对那些活动人士的举动采取报
复行动。

这些气球是从边境城市坡州的京畿道旅游地放飞的，当地的韩国警察上星期一曾经
阻止了一次气球放飞。

朝鲜官方的朝中社在第一次尝试放飞气球之前说，如果传单进入朝鲜境内，朝鲜人
民军将不经警告就进行“无情的打击”。

但第一次放飞气球失败的几小时后，活动人士就从首尔以西的江华岛放飞气球，而
朝鲜并未做出军事反应。

**South Korean Activists Float Leaflets Into North Korea**

South Korean activists have sent tens of thousands of anti-Pyongyang leaflets
across the border by balloons into North Korea, one week after warnings
from Seoul and threats of retaliation from Pyongyang.

Around a dozen activists attached 50,000 leaflets to seven balloons Monday
and sent them floating over the Demilitarized Zone dividing the two countries.
Some local residents fearing reprisal from the North scuffled with the activists.


The balloons were launched from the Imjingak resort in the border city of
Paju, where South Korean police blocked an earlier launch attempt last Monday.


The North's official Korean Central News Agency said before the first attempt
that the Korean People's Army would conduct a "merciless strike" without
warning if the leaflets were sent.

However, just hours after the launch was aborted, the activists launched
balloons from Ganghwa Island, west of Seoul, with no military response from
the North.
