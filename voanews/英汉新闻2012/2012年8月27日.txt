**热带风暴“艾萨克”向美国墨西哥湾沿岸移动**

热带风暴“艾萨克”给佛罗里达州基斯岛礁群和迈阿密带来狂风暴雨后，于星期一清晨旋进墨西哥湾。

美国国家飓风中心说，预计“艾萨克”威力星期二将成为飓风，侵袭佛罗里达州和路易斯安那州之间的墨西哥湾沿岸某些地区。

阿拉巴马、佛罗里达、路易斯安那和密西西比等四州已宣布进入紧急状态，准备应对“艾萨克”带来的暴雨。

新奥尔良市市长兰德里欧宣布该市进入紧急状态，并通知居民做好准备，供水和供电可能在未来几天中断。他还敦促居民们一旦发布疏散令，就要撤离。

7年前“卡特里娜”飓风侵袭新奥尔良时，很多居民没有撤离。星期三是飓风“卡特里娜”灾害七周年。当时“卡特里娜”席卷新奥尔良和墨西哥湾沿岸大部分地区，造成1800多人死亡，数以千计的人无家可归。

**Tropical Storm Isaac Sets Sights on US Gulf Coast **

Tropical Storm Isaac swirled into the Gulf of Mexico early Monday, after lashing the Florida Keys and Miami area with wind and rain.

The National Hurricane Center says Isaac is expected to strengthen into a hurricane Tuesday, before hitting the Gulf Coast somewhere between Florida and Louisiana.

Four states -- Alabama, Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi -- have declared states of emergency as they brace for Isaac's deluge.

New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu has declared a state of emergency for his city, telling residents to be prepared to live without regular water or power supplies for several days. He also urged them to leave if an evacuation order is issued.

Many did not leave seven years ago when Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans. Wednesday marks Katrina's seventh anniversary. Katrina ravaged New Orleans and much of the Gulf Coast, killing more than 1,800 people and leaving thousands more homeless.
