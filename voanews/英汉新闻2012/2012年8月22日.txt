**日本驻韩大使将返回首尔**

日本驻韩国大使将重返首尔，一星期前，日本和韩国围绕有争议岛屿的争端激化，日本召回驻韩大使。

日本外务大臣玄叶光一郎星期三说，日本驻韩大使武藤正敏将返回首尔，协助处理有关有争议岛屿的问题。日本和韩国分别将这个岛屿称为“竹岛”和“独岛”。

东京上星期召回驻韩大使，以抗议韩国总统李明博登上这个岛屿。据信这个岛屿周围海域能源矿藏丰富。

韩国星期二拒绝了日本提出的将两国之间几十年来的岛屿主权争端交与国际法庭仲裁的提议。

** Japan's Ambassador Returns to S.Korea **

Japan's ambassador is back to South Korea, one week after recalling him in the wake of an intensifying island dispute between the two Asian neighbors.

Foreign Minister Koichiro Gemba said Wednesday the ambassador, Masatoshi Muto, will return to Seoul to help manage the dispute over the islands, known as Takeshima in Japan and Dokdo in Korea.

Tokyo recalled the ambassador last week to protest South Korean President Lee Myung-bak's visit to the strategic islands, which are thought to be surrounded by energy deposits.

On Tuesday, South Korea dismissed a proposal by Japan to take the decades-old dispute to the International Court of Justice.

**美国共和党通过反堕胎的竞选纲领**

准备下星期举行全国大会的美国共和党人通过了一项竞选纲领，其内容包括争取通过一项取缔堕胎的宪法修正案。

共和党反对堕胎的主张没有把因强奸和乱伦而施行的堕胎排除在外，因此与该党总统候选人罗姆尼的立场有所抵触。共和党的竞选纲领还要求通过一项宪法修正案，赋予未出生胎儿不可剥夺的生命权。共和党不要求本党总统候选人支持该党的纲领。

共和党是星期二通过这项竞选纲领的。同一天，共和党众议员埃金宣布，他将继续竞选密苏里州参议员。埃金本星期早些时候发表“法定强奸”并不会导致意外怀孕的言论之后，遭到严厉批评。

包括罗姆尼在内的很多共和党领导人要求埃金退出参议员竞选，他们担心埃金的言论引发的争论将危及共和党取得参议院控制权的机会。

** Republicans Approve Anti-Abortion Campaign Platform**

Republicans preparing for the party convention, next week, have adopted a platform, or statement of beliefs, that includes a call for a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion.

The party's anti-abortion pledge does not include exceptions in cases of rape or incest, putting it at odds with the views of likely Republican nominee Mitt Romney. The platform also calls for a constitutional amendment that would grant an unborn child a fundamental right to life that cannot be infringed. Candidates are not required to support their party's statement of beliefs

The platform was approved on Tuesday, the same day that Republican Congressman Todd Akin announced he would remain in the race for a Senate seat in (the midwestern state of) Missouri. Akin had come under harsh criticism for his remarks earlier this week that "legitimate rape" does not lead to an unwanted pregnancy.

Many Republican leaders, including Romney himself, demanded that Akin withdraw from the race, fearing the controversy would endanger the party's chances of taking control of the Senate.
