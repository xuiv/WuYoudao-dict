The U.S. Defense Department says seven members of an elite Navy SEAL team have been disciplined for disclosing classified information when they served as consultants to developers of a video game.

Officials said Thursday that the SEALs are alleged to have divulged the information and shown the designers specially-designed combat equipment without authorization from their superiors. The designers were developing a game known as Medal of Honor: Warfighter.
