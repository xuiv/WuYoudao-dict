**中国对欧盟光伏产品展开反倾销调查**

中国开始调查欧盟是否对其光伏产品提供不公平的补贴，这是中国与欧盟和美国之间一系列贸易争端中的最近举措。

中国商务部星期四说，这次反倾销调查将集中于欧盟是否以不正常的低价格在中国销售太阳能级多晶硅，这是生产太阳能电池的主要材料。

在中国采取这项举措之前，欧盟9月对中国公司展开了类似的调查，以确定这些公司是否以比实际成本低多达80%的价格向欧洲出口太阳能电池板。

本月早些时候，美国向中国制造的太阳能电池板征收最高达250%的关税，以抵消美国方面所说的不适当的政府补贴。

北京警告说，这些争端将在新能源市场引发更大规模的贸易摩擦。很多国家把这个领域看作越来越重要的就业机会来源。

**China Launches Anti-Dumping Probe into EU Solar Products**


China is starting an investigation into whether the European Union is unfairly subsidizing solar exports, the latest in a series of Beijing's trade disputes with Europe and the United States.

China's Commerce Ministry said Thursday the anti-dumping probe will focus on whether the EU sold solar-grade polysilicon, a key material in the production of solar cells, at artificially low prices in China.

The move comes after the EU launched a similar investigation in September into whether Chinese companies were selling panels in Europe at up to 80 percent below actual cost.

The U.S. earlier this month imposed final duties of up to 250 percent on imports of Chinese-made solar panels to counter what it said was improper government subsidies.

Beijing has warned that the disputes will provoke greater trade friction in the new energy market, which is seen by many governments as an increasingly important source of job growth.

**在严密保安状态下,中国准备领导层权力交接**

中国共产党高层领导人在严密保安状态下在北京举行闭门会议，为下周开始的十年一次的正式权力交接进行最后准备。

中国官方的新华社说，中共十七大最后一次会议于星期四开始举行。新华社的简讯说，会议将讨论修改党章以及其他提议。

预计这次会议将持续一周。会议很可能正式开除名誉扫地的前政治局委员薄熙来，预计薄熙来不久将因被控腐败和其他罪名受审。

这次会议也是中共领导人围绕党内领导职务进行角力的最后机会之一，最终结果将在下星期四开幕的中共十八大上揭晓。

**Amid Heavy Security, China Readies for Leadership Handover**

Senior Chinese Communist leaders have gathered amid heavy security for a closed-door meeting in Beijing, where they will put the finishing touches on a once-a-decade leadership handover that officially begins next week.

China's state-run Xinhua news agency said the final gathering of the Communist Party's 17th Central Committee opened Thursday. The short memo said that changes to the party's constitution and other proposals are being discussed.

The meeting, expected to last for a week, will likely result in the formal expulsion of disgraced politician and former Politburo member Bo Xilai, who is expected to soon stand trial for corruption and other charges.

It also represents one of the last chances for Communist leaders to haggle over party leadership positions to be unveiled at the 18th Party Congress beginning next Thursday.
