**国际红十字会：叙利亚内战范围扩大**

国际红十字会说，目前叙利亚更多地区处于内战状态，超出了早先确定的范围。

国际红十字会曾说，叙利亚政府军与反对派组织在霍姆斯、哈马和伊德利卜等地区发生冲突。

但国际国际红十字会发言人哈桑星期天说，武装冲突已经蔓延到叙利亚其他地区。活动人士和当地居民说，大马士革发生了自反抗阿萨德统治的起义16个月前爆发以来最激烈的战斗。

与此同时，叙利亚否认政府军上星期四对特雷姆萨村使用了重型武器和飞机。但是，曾于星期六和星期天到过特雷姆萨村的联合国监督人员发现了叙利亚政府军使用重武器的证据。

叙利亚外交部发言人说，在特雷姆萨村的军事行动是针对那里的武装分子。

**Red Cross Widens Area Involved in Syrian Civil War**

The International Red Cross says there is a state of civil war across more parts of Syria, widening its earlier designation.

The group had previously said such conflict existed between government forces and opposition groups in the flash-point areas of Homs, Hama and Idlib.

But ICRC spokesman Hicham Hassan said Sunday hostilities have spread to other parts of Syria. Activists and residents say Damascus was the scene of the heaviest fighting to hit the capital since the 16-month uprising against Mr. Assad's rule began.

The Red Cross finding comes as Syria denied its forces used heavy weapons and aircraft against the village of Tremseh last week, despite findings of the U.N. monitors who visited the area Saturday and Sunday.

A Syrian foreign ministry spokesman says the military operation in the village targeted armed fighters.
