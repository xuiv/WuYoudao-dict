**埃及总统扩权 反对派上街抗议**


埃及总统穆罕默德•穆尔西说，他希望把国家推向稳定与安全，并表示他不想大权独揽。

穆尔西星期五在开罗发表讲话时作出了这番表态。同时，他的支持者和反政府抗议者在开罗不同地段举行集会。穆尔西说，解散立法机构的决定不是他做的，他誓言要继续努力制定埃及新宪法。他说，埃及正在迈向自由与民主。

在他讲这番话的一天前，穆尔西让自己的职位不受监督，还宣布，法院或任何权威机构均无权受理针对他的决定所提出的申诉。

在他宣布扩大总统权力后，反对派支持者在开罗解放广场集会示威，并放火焚烧了苏伊士、赛义德港和伊斯梅利亚等好几座城市的穆斯林兄弟会办事处。

反对派领袖、诺贝尔和平奖得主穆罕默德•巴拉迪说，穆尔希等于是宣布自己是“新法老”。预计巴拉迪将参加开罗的抗议活动。这位自由派政治人物和前联合国原子能机构负责人说，穆尔西篡夺了所有国家权力。他警告说，这可能会有严重的后果。

穆尔西总统的发言人是在星期四宣布的总统令，理由是必须“保卫革命”。反对派成员称穆尔西此举是非法行为。

总统令禁止埃及法院解散议会上院以及负责起草新宪法的制宪大会。这两个机构都由穆尔西的伊斯兰主义盟友主导。此外，穆尔西还下令重新审判那些使用暴力镇压去年民众革命的前政府官员，包括长期执政的前总统穆巴拉克。他的支持者说，早就该下这样的命令了。

在穆尔西采取这些行动之前，国际社会正在赞扬他为调解加沙停火所做的努力。


Egyptian Opposition Protests After President Grants Himself Sweeping Powers


Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi says he wants to move Egypt forward as a stable and safe nation, and says he does not want sole control of the country.

He made the remarks in a speech Friday in Cairo, as supporters and anti-government protesters rallied in different parts of the city. Mr. Morsi said he was not behind the dissolving of the lawmaking body, and he vowed to continue the nation's work on a new constitution. He said Egypt is on a path to freedom and democracy.

His remarks come a day after he put himself above oversight and declared that his decisions cannot be appealed by the courts or any other authority.

In reponse, opposition supporters gathered to demonstrate in Cairo's Tahrir Square and set fire to Muslim Brotherhood offices in several other cities, including Suez, Port Said, and Ismailia.

Opposition leader and Nobel laureate Mohamed ElBaradai, who says Mr. Morsi has declared himself a "new pharaoh," is expected to attend the Cairo protests. The liberal politician and former chief of the U.N. nuclear energy agency says Mr. Morsi has usurped all state powers and warned that there could be dire consequences.

President Morsi's spokesman announced the decree Thursday, citing a need to "protect the revolution." Opposition members have called the move illegal.

The decree also bars Egypt's judiciary from dissolving the upper house of parliament and an assembly drafting a new constitution -- two bodies dominated by Mr. Morsi's Islamist allies.

In addition, Mr. Morsi has ordered retrials of former officials who used violence in efforts to suppress last year's popular revolution against longtime president Hosni Mubarak.

Mr. Morsi's supporters say his decree was long overdue.

The president's action comes after he received international praise for mediating a Gaze cease-fire.


**以色列开枪 一名巴勒斯坦人被打死**


在加沙地带边界，以色列枪弹打死了一名巴勒斯坦人，这是以色列和哈马斯激进分子停火并结束历时八天的冲突以来发生的第一起死亡事例。

巴勒斯坦医疗救护官员说，安瓦尔•库德赫星期五在和一群巴勒斯坦靠近边境围栏时被击中。还有几人在暴力中受伤。路透社援引库德赫的一名亲属的话说，他当时想把一面哈马斯旗帜竖在围栏上。

以色列说，在这群人靠近以色列边界之际，以军对空鸣枪示警。暂时还没有听到哈马斯激进分子方面的反应。

在发生这起暴力事件之际，当地天空已经有超过一天的时间平静无事。由埃及调解的停火已在星期三夜晚生效。

加沙的哈马斯总理哈尼耶赞扬加沙地带各个激进组织遵守停火。

以色列总理内塔尼亚胡说，以色列政府正在“给停火一次机会”，但同时为停火可能破裂做好了准备。

Israeli Gunfire Kills Palestinian

Israeli gunfire at the Gaza Strip border has killed a Palestinian--the first death since a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas militants halted eight days of deadly fighting.

Palestinian medical officials say Anwar Qdeih was shot as he approached the border fence Friday with a group of Palestinians. Several others were wounded in the violence. Reuters news agency quotes a relative of Qdeih as saying he was trying to place a Hamas flag on the fence.

Israel said troops fired warning shots in the air when a group approached the Israeli border. There was no immediate reaction from Hamas militants.

The violence comes amid more than a day of quiet skies, after an Egyptian-brokered truce went into effect late Wednesday.

Gaza's Hamas prime minister, Ismail Haniyeh, hailed the territory's multiple militant groups for respecting the cease-fire.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his government was "giving the truce a chance," but was prepared for its possible collapse.
