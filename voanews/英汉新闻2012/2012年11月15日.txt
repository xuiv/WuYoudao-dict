**以色列炸死哈马斯领导人后安理会为此召开的紧急会议结束**

以色列星期三的空袭炸死伊斯兰激进组织哈马斯下属的武装派别“卡桑旅”的领导人艾哈迈德.贾巴里后，联合国安理会夜间召开紧急会议，目前会议已经结束。

联合国安理会有15个理事国，担任本月安理会轮值主席、印度常驻联合国代表普里说，作为印度常驻联合国代表，他希望本次会议能够导致加沙地带暴力减少。这次安理会紧急会议是应埃及和安理会成员国摩洛哥以巴基斯坦人的名义要求召开的。

巴勒斯坦和埃及外交官早些时候警告说，他们可能派遣地面部队进入加沙地带。

以色列星期三发射的一枚导弹炸死了艾哈迈德.贾巴里，当时他驾驶的车辆行驶在加沙市。以色列警告其他哈马斯成员今后几天不要“在地上露面”。

这次空袭是以色列打击加沙巴勒斯坦激进分子行动的一部分。巴勒斯坦方面说，10人被炸死。这次空袭行动是对巴勒斯坦激进分子几乎每天对以色列进行火箭袭击做出的直接反应。

巴勒斯坦激进分子进行报复，发动新一轮火箭袭击。以色列的导弹防御系统拦截了13枚火箭，至少一枚火箭落在比尔谢巴镇，但没有造成伤亡。

**NSC Ends Emergency Meeting After Israeli Strike Kills Hamas Commander**

The United Nations Security Council has ended a late-night emergency meeting after an Israeli airstrike in Gaza killed the top military commander of Hamas Wednesday.

Indian Ambassador Hardeep Singh Puri, who heads the 15-nation council this month, said in his capacity as Indian ambassador that he hopes the meeting will lead to a de-escalation of violence in Gaza. Egypt and council member Morocco requested the emergency session on behalf of the Palestinians.

Palestinian and Egyptian diplomats has warned earlier that they may send ground forces into Gaza.

An Israeli missile killed Ahmed al-Jaabari Wednesday as he drove in a car in Gaza City. Israel is warning other Hamas members not to "show their faces above ground" in the next few days.

The attack was part of a wave of airstrikes against Islamic militants in Gaza which Palestinians say has killed at least 10 people. It was a direct response to almost daily Palestinian militant rocket strikes on Israel.

The militants retaliated with another barrage. Israel's missile defense system intercepted 13 rockets with at least one falling in the town of Beersheba. No one was hurt.
