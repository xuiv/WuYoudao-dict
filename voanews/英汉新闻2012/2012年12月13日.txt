**日本战机紧急升空应对有争议岛屿上空的中国飞机**

在一架中国飞机进入东海靠近有争议岛屿的上空后，日本F-15战机紧急升空。

日本内阁官方长官藤村树说，派遣战机升空是为了应对星期四早上在岛屿附近发现的一架中国海洋局的飞机。

日本首相办公室的一名发言人对美国之音证实，日本自卫队两架F-15战机和一架E-2C“鹰眼”预警机在冲绳那霸紧急升空。

他说，日本副外相河相周夫告诉他的办公室，就此要对中国政府提出正式抗议。

日本称为尖阁列岛、中国称为钓鱼岛的海岛无人居住，但却是这两个亚洲大国之间的主要紧张根源。

自从东京政府9月份从私人地主手中购买钓鱼岛以来，中国经常派出巡逻船在有争议海域巡逻。分析人士说，北京试图以此建立起一个它可以在该海域自由往来的事实。

日本海岸警卫队说，星期四早些时候，在靠近由日本管理的钓鱼岛海域看到4艘中国的海监船。

**Japan Scrambles fighter jets After Chinese Plane Enters Disputed Territory**

Japan has scrambled F-15 fighter jets after a Chinese plane entered disputed airspace near contested islands in the East China Sea.

Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura says the jets were sent in response to a Chinese Oceanic Administration airplane that was spotted near the islands on Thursday.

A spokesperson for the Japanese prime minister's office confirmed to VOA that two Japan Air Self Defense Force F-15 jets and a E-2C "Hawkeye" observation aircraft were scrambled from Naha, Okinawa.

He said Vice Foreign Minister Chikao Kawai told his office to lodge an official protest with the Chinese government in response.

The uninhabited islands, known in Japan as Senkaku and in China as Diaoyu, have been the source of major tension between the two Asian powers.

Since Tokyo purchased the islands from a private landowner in September, China has sent regular patrol missions to the disputed waters, in what analysts say is Beijing's attempt to establish the fact that it can come and go as its pleases.

The Japanese Coast Guard says four Chinese maritime surveillance vessels were seen near the Japan-administered islands earlier on Thursday.

**欧盟达成欧元区银行业监管协议**

欧洲联盟的财政部长们达成协议，建立一个欧元区银行业的统一监管机构，以图解决欧洲债务危机的一个关键组成问题。

这项星期四早上达成的协议授予欧洲央银行很大权力，监管欧元区17个国家的银行，以及欧盟国家中那些决定接受监管的非欧元区国家的银行。

法国财政部长莫斯柯维奇赞扬这项协议说，这将有助于提升外部对欧元区的信心。

欧盟领导人在6月份的峰会上原则上同意建立一个银行监管的中央机构，并保证年底前制定计划。监管将于明年3月开始实施，2014年初全面运行。

银行的困境极大影响了一些欧洲国家的经济，导致欧洲债务的蔓延，影响到政府，使得政府不得不介入，救助他们的银行。

新的监管机构最终将允许欧洲援助资金向受困银行直接注资，这也是向着建立银行业联盟的方向迈出的一步，银行业联盟将有权关闭受困的银行。

**EU Reaches Eurozone Bank Supervision Deal**

European Union finance ministers have reached a deal to create a single supervisor for eurozone banks, in a bid to address a key component of the continent's financial struggles.

The agreement reached early Thursday gives the European Central Bank broad powers to oversee banks in the 17 nations that use the euro currency, as well as institutions in other EU nations that opt in to the system.

French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici praised the agreement, saying it will help boost outside confidence in the eurozone.

EU leaders agreed on the principal of a central banking oversight body at a summit in June and promised a plan by the end of the year. The oversight is due to begin in March and be fully operational in early 2014.

Failing banks have drastically affected some European economies, spreading the debt crisis to governments that stepped in to save their banks.

The new oversight body will ultimately allow Europe's rescue fund to directly inject money into troubled banks. It is also the first step toward a banking union with the ability to close down failing banks.
