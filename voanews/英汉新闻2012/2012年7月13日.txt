**中国经济增长速度降至三年来最低点**

中国官员说，受到全球经济前景不确定的影响，中国的经济发展速度降至三年来的最低点。

中国国家统计局星期五发表的报告显示，中国2012年第二季度的经济增长率为7.6%，大大低于去年同期的9.7%。中国2009年第二季度的经济增长率为6.1%，今年第二季度的经济增长率是自那时以来的最低点。

其他国家对中国出口产品的需求减少以及内需市场疲软，是导致中国经济增长速度减慢的原因。

** China's Economic Growth Slows to 3-Year Low**

Chinese officials say economic growth has slumped to a three-year low, dragged down by global economic uncertainties.

The National Bureau of Statistics reported Friday that the economy grew by 7.6 percent in the second quarter of 2012, sharply slowing from a 9.7 percent growth rate in the same quarter of 2011.

The figure was the lowest recorded since the 6.1 percent increase seen in the second quarter of 2009.

Lower demand in other countries for Chinese exports as well as weak domestic demand has been blamed for weakened growth.

**泰国宪法法院将就修宪计划做出裁决**


泰国宪法法院星期五将裁定泰国政府的修宪计划是否合法。

目前的泰国宪法是由军方制定的。军方罢黜了前总理他信的职务。现任总理英拉·西瓦那的政党说，必须对宪法进行修正，以便泰国实现更大程度的民主化。英拉·西瓦那是他信的妹妹。

但反对党民主党说，修宪将对王室的地位构成威胁，并会允许流亡国外的他信在没有服刑的情况下返回泰国。他信被判犯有腐败罪。

无论泰国宪法法院做出何种裁决，都可能使泰国再度出现街头暴力。2010年4月和5月发生的暴力曾使曼谷陷于瘫痪状态。

** Thailand High Court to Rule on Constitutional Amendments**

Thailand's Constitutional Court will decide on Friday whether government plans to amend the constitution are legal.

The current constitution was drawn up by the military, which deposed former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, and the party of current prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra -- Thaksin's sister -- says the amendments are needed to bring more democracy to Thailand.

However, opposition Democrats say the changes would threaten the role of the revered monarchy and allow the exiled Thaksin Shinawatra back into the country without doing jail time for a conviction on corruption charges.

A ruling either way could spark a return to street violence that paralyzed Bangkok in April and May of 2010.
