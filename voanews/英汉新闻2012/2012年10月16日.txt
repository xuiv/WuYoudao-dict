**国务卿克林顿为美国外交人员安全承担责任**

美国国务卿希拉里·克林顿为美国驻利比亚领馆上月遭受致命袭击承担责任，并表示驻世界各地美国国务院人员的安全事务属于她的职责范围。

克林顿星期一访问秘鲁期间接受电视采访时说，奥巴马总统和拜登副总统不了解安全人员所做的具体决定。

克林顿还表示，有关9月11号导致美国驻利比亚大使以及其他三名美国人被杀害的袭击情况当时并不清楚。

那次袭击和奥巴马政府对此做出的反应成为总统竞选中的一个议题。共和党总统候选人罗姆尼批评奥巴马没有为美国驻班加西领馆提供更多的安全措施。

克林顿星期一说，她不想让那次袭击成为一场政治责难运动的一部分。

**Clinton Takes Responsibility for Diplomatic Security**

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is taking responsibility for a deadly attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya last month, saying it is her job to be in charge of security for State Department employees working around the world.

Clinton said in television interviews during a visit to Peru Monday that President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden would not know about specific decisions made by security personnel.

She also said circumstances surrounding attacks like the one on September 11 that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans are not always clear at the time.

The attack, and the Obama administration's response, have become an issue in the presidential campaign. Republican candidate Mitt Romney has criticized Mr. Obama for not providing more security at the consulate in Benghazi.

Clinton said Monday she did not want the attack to be part of a political "blame game."

**日本：七艘中国海军船只出现在日本一岛屿附近**

日本说，在一个日本岛屿附近发现七艘中国海军船只。目前中国和日本这两个亚洲大国之间的关系由于东海领土争端继续处于高度紧张状态。

日本防卫厅说，日本飞机星期二清晨在距离日本最西端岛屿与那国岛大约50公里的海域发现中国船只。

日本防卫厅说，这些中国船只的所处位置临近日本领海，依照国际法，日本在该海域拥有某些权利。

自9月以来，中国增派船只到日本控制的海域巡航，日本于9月将一些北京宣称拥有主权的岛屿收归国有。到目前为止，中日两国尚未发生冲突。

**Tokyo: Seven Chinese Navy Ships Near Japanese Island**

Japan says it has spotted seven Chinese naval ships near one of its islands, as tensions between the two Asian powers remain high over a territorial dispute in the East China Sea.

Japan's Defense Ministry says the Chinese ships were spotted early Tuesday by Japanese aircraft about 50 kilometers outside Yonaguni Island, Japan's westernmost island.

The ministry said the ships were in the contiguous zone, an area just outside Japan's territorial waters in which Japan has certain rights under international law.

China has increasingly sent ships to patrol Japanese-controlled areas since September, when Japan nationalized a group of islands claimed by Beijing. So far there have been no clashes.
