**埃及政府军在总统府部署坦克**

埃及政府军星期四在开罗总统府外面部署了坦克。在此之前，穆尔西总统的支持者和反对者之间爆发冲突，导致5人死亡。

在总统府外面政府军至少部署了5辆坦克和两辆其他装甲车。在埃及首都两天来的暴力冲突中，有350多人受伤。

在现场报道的美国之音记者阿洛特说，星期三的冲突是因为穆尔西的伊斯兰主义支持者攻击反对派示威者引起的。示威者因为穆尔西上个月发布独揽大权的政令而愤怒。

阿洛特说，大多数支持总统的人都留着胡子，而反对穆尔西总统的人都是年轻人和一些妇女。留胡子是伊斯兰主义穆斯林兄弟会成员的典型形象。

**Egypt Army Deploys Tanks at Presidential Palace**

The Egyptian army has deployed tanks outside the presidential palace in Cairo Thursday following clashes between opponents and supporters of President Mohamed Morsi that have killed five people.

The army has stationed at least five tanks and two other armored vehicles outside the presidential complex. More than 350 people have been injured in the Egyptian capital during the two days of violence.

Reporting from the scene, VOA correspondent Elizabeth Arrott said the violence started Wednesday when Mr. Morsi's Islamist supporters attacked opposition demonstrators angered by the president's decree issued last month.

Arrott said most of the presidential supporters were men with beards, typical of members of the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood, while opponents of the president appeared younger and included some women.

美国技术企业家约翰•迈卡菲因非法入境而在危地马拉被逮捕。迈卡菲逃到危地马拉，以避免在伯利兹就他的邻居遭到谋杀一案接受讯问。

危地马拉内政部长洛佩兹说，迈卡菲星期三在危地马拉城被拘留，随后被带到一处属于移民局的住所。

美国人格雷戈利•福尔遭到致命枪击后，现年67岁的迈卡菲上月逃离伯利兹。他本星期早些时候在危地马拉露面，并宣布他将在这个中美洲国家寻求避难。迈卡菲说，如果他被送回伯利兹，他将有生命危险。

**US Internet Security Pioneer Arrested in Guatemala**

U.S. technology entrepreneur John McAfee has been arrested in Guatemala for illegally entering the country. He fled there to avoid questioning in neighboring Belize about the murder of his neighbor.

Guatemala Interior Minister Mauricio Lopez Bonilla says McAfee was detained Wednesday in Guatemala City and taken to a residence belonging to the immigration department.

The 67-year-old McAfee fled Belize last month after the deadly shooting of fellow American Gregory Faull. He emerged in Guatemala earlier this week and announced he would seek asylum in the Central American country. He says his life will be in danger if he is sent back to Belize.
