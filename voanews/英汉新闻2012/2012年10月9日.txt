**朝鲜宣称导弹可以打击美国本土**

朝鲜警告说，它的导弹可以打到美国本土。两天前，韩国说，它与美国签署了一项协议，允许韩国增加其弹道导弹的射程。

朝鲜国防委员会的发言人星期二通过国家媒体说，平壤方面拥有的战略导弹部队不仅可以打击美国本土，而且还可以打击韩国、日本和关岛的美军基地。

朝鲜被认为正在研制洲际弹道导弹，但是还没有试验成功。专家说，朝鲜的导弹虽然具有打击韩国和其它附近邻国的能力，但是打不到美国。

这是自从美国和韩国星期天宣布达成增加韩国导弹射程的协议以来朝鲜第一次做出公开反应。美韩协议允许韩国把其导弹射程扩大将近三倍，以防御掌握核武器的朝鲜可能发动的攻击。

**North Korea Says Its Rockets Could Hit Continental US **

North Korea is warning that its rockets are capable of striking the continental United States, two days after Seoul said it signed a deal with Washington to allow South Korea to extend the range of its ballistic missiles.

A spokesperson for the North's National Defense Commission said in state media Tuesday Pyongyang has "strategic rocket forces" that can hit not only the mainland U.S., but also American military bases in South Korea, Japan and Guam.

North Korea is believed to be developing intercontinental ballistic missiles, but they have not been tested successfully. While Pyongyang does have the capability to strike South Korea and other nearby countries, experts say it could not strike the U.S. mainland.

It is Pyongyang's first public reaction to the deal announced Sunday in Seoul between the U.S. and South Korea, which nearly tripled the range of Seoul's missile system to protect against a possible attack from the nuclear-armed North.

**奥巴马罗姆尼争夺俄亥俄关键选票**

美国总统奥巴马和共和党总统竞选人罗姆尼星期二到选情尚不明了但对决定选举成败举足轻重的俄亥俄州竞选。美国大选4星期后举行。他们都希望在那之前争取更多选民的支持。

最新的民意调查显示，两位候选人在11月6号大选前的民众支持率基本不相上下。俄亥俄州是投票走向难以确定的几个州之一。这些州可能会决定哪个候选人会胜选。

奥巴马总统虽然上星期与罗姆尼进行国内政策辩论后民众调查的支持率有所下降，但是他星期一晚上在一个竞选筹款活动上对支持者说，他对赢得选举抱有相当大的信心。奥巴马呼吁支持者在投票日到来那一天之前丝毫不要松懈。

罗姆尼星期一指称奥巴马是一名软弱的领导人，特别是在中东问题上。

**Obama, Romney Vie for Key Ohio Votes **

U.S. President Barack Obama and Republican candidate Mitt Romney take their campaigns to the key political battleground state of Ohio Tuesday, as they seek to win over voters with four weeks left before the election.

The latest polls indicate the two candidates are virtually tied ahead of the November 6 vote. Ohio is one of the few so-called swing states that are expected to decide who wins.

Despite losing ground in the polls to Mr. Romney following a debate on domestic policy last week, Mr. Obama told supporters at a fundraising event Monday night that he "very much" intends to win the election. He urged his backers to be "almost obsessive" in their efforts until election day.

Earlier Monday, Mr. Romney accused the president of being a weak leader, especially with regard to the Middle East.
