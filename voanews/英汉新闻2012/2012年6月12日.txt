**联合国：对朝鲜提供人道援助经费严重不足**

联合国呼吁国际社会抛开政治分歧，加紧筹款，帮助解决朝鲜目前面临的严重人道需求问题。

联合国星期二说，虽然联合国2012年已经呼吁国际社会再提供1亿9800万美元，以解决这个贫困的共产主义国家最迫切的人道需求，但对朝鲜提供的人道援助目前仍然存在资金严重不足的问题。

2011年，联合国呼吁为朝鲜提供2亿1800万美元援助，但国际捐助者提供的捐款只略超过这个数额的三分之一。联合国表示，由于资金不足，不能有效地解决朝鲜的人道需求问题。

联合国发表朝鲜人道需求的严重情况的报告说，1600万朝鲜人继续受到长期粮食短缺、广泛的营养不良以及严重经济问题的影响。

联合国说，儿童营养不良的问题在朝鲜尤其严重，在五岁以下的朝鲜儿童中，将近三分之一发育不良，而且数以百计的儿童死于像是腹泻这类可预防的疾病。

**UN: Humanitarian Efforts in North Korea 'Seriously Underfunded' **

The United Nations is calling for the international community to put aside political differences and boost funding to help address what it says are the dire humanitarian needs of North Koreans.

The U.N. said Tuesday that aid efforts in North Korea remain "seriously underfunded," even as it unveiled a funding request for an additional $198 million to respond to "key humanitarian priorities" in the impoverished communist state in 2012.

International donors provided just over a third of the $218 million the U.N. requested for North Korean aid in 2011. Because of the lack of funds, the international body said it was unable to effectively address the humanitarian needs there.

The U.N. described serious humanitarian conditions in North Korea in its report, saying 16 million people continue to suffer from chronic food insecurity, high malnutrition rates, and deep-rooted economic problems.

It said undernourished children are particularly at risk, with nearly a third of children under five showing signs of stunting and hundreds more dying from preventable conditions such as diarrhea.

**潘基文、安南要求叙利亚准许监督员进入反政府的哈费镇**

联合国秘书长潘基文和国际特使安南要求叙利亚政府允许联合国监督人员进入反政府的叙利亚西北部城镇哈费。联合国担心，叙利亚安全部队正在计划对平民进行屠杀。

叙利亚活动人士和哈费居民说，叙利亚政府军的直升机和坦克对拉塔基亚省的这座城市进行轰袭，使很多平民困在城里。潘基文星期一晚间发表声明说，允许联合国观察员“不受阻碍地进入”哈费是非常重要的。早些时候，安南表示对哈费的局势深感担忧，并要求叙利亚当局允许监督人员立即进入哈费。

美国国务院发言人纽兰说，来自叙利亚的消息显示当局可能正在计划在哈费以及其他反对派控制的地区进行屠杀，包括大马士革郊区、达拉、代尔祖尔、哈马和霍姆斯，华盛顿方面对这些报道深表忧虑。

总部设在英国的叙利亚人权了望台说，叙利亚政府军和反政府武装星期一在全国范围的攻击造成至少63名平民和21名军人死亡。

**UN's Ban, Annan to Syria: Let Monitors Enter Rebel Town **

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and international envoy Kofi Annan have called on Syria to allow U.N. monitors to enter a rebellious northwestern town where the United States fears Syrian security forces are planning to massacre civilians.

Syrian activists and residents of Al-Haffeh say government helicopters and tanks have been attacking the town in Latakia province, trapping many civilians. In a statement released late Monday, Mr. Ban said it is important for U.N. observers to be granted "unimpeded access" to Al-Haffeh. Earlier, Mr. Annan had expressed "grave concern" about the situation in the town and "demanded" that the monitors be allowed to enter "immediately."

U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Washington is deeply alarmed about reports from inside Syria that government forces "may be organizing" massacres in Al-Haffeh and other opposition strongholds, including the Damascus suburbs, Daraa, Deir el-Zour, Hama and Homs.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said nationwide attacks by government and rebel forces killed at least 63 civilians and 21 troops on Monday.
