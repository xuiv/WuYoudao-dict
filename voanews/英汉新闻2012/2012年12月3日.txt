**埃及法官抵制穆斯林支持的宪法全民公决**

埃及一个有影响力的法官组织说，该组织成员将不会监督12月15日举行的新宪法全民公决。此举可能会影响埃及伊斯兰主义总统穆尔西支持的宪法的合法性。

埃及法官俱乐部星期天通过国营媒体中东新闻社发表的一份声明中说，该俱乐部成员一致同意抵制宪法全民公决。埃及法官通常要监督全民公决投票的过程。

埃及很多法官上个月停止工作，抗议穆尔西禁止法院挑战其决定的政令。埃及最高法院的法官们星期天也宣布停止工作。他们说，由于“心理和身体压力”，他们将无限期地暂停工作。

法官们说，由于数百名伊斯兰主义者在法院大楼外集会，他们不敢进入最高宪法法院参加星期天的法庭听证会。穆尔西的助手说，抗议活动是和平的。很多伊斯兰主义者抱怨说，最高法院法官是穆巴拉克任命的，所以对他们抱有偏见。曾长期执政的前埃及总统穆巴拉克持反伊斯兰主义立场，在去年的民众起义中被赶下台。

埃及最高宪法法院原计划做出可能导致两个由伊斯兰主义者主导的机构被解散，即起草新宪法的委员会和议会上院。

**Egyptian Judges to Boycott Referendum on Islamist-Backed Constitution**

An influential group of Egyptian judges says it will not oversee a December 15 referendum on a new constitution, a move that could undermine the legitimacy of the charter supported by the nation's Islamist president.

In a statement published Sunday by state news agency MENA, the Judges Club said its members unanimously agreed to boycott the referendum, a voting process that Egyptian judges usually supervise.

Many Egyptian judges went on strike last month to protest President Mohammed Morsi's decree barring courts from challenging his decisions. The judges of Egypt's top court joined them on Sunday, saying they have suspended their work indefinitely because of what they called "psychological and physical pressures."

The judges said they were afraid to enter the Supreme Constitutional Court for a Sunday session in the midst of a rally by hundreds of Islamists outside the building. Mr. Morsi's aides said the protest was peaceful. Many Islamists complain that the top court is biased against them because its judges were appointed by Hosni Mubarak, the longtime anti-Islamist president ousted last year in a popular uprising.

The Supreme Constitutional Court had planned to issue rulings that could have dissolved two Islamist-controlled assemblies -- the panel that drafted the new constitution and the upper house of parliament.

**克林顿为美国公司争取核电厂扩建合同**

美国国务卿希拉里·克林顿目前正在对捷克共和国进行短暂访问，其日程包括帮助一家美国公司赢得一座核电厂的建筑合同。

克林顿星期一将会晤捷克总理内恰斯和外交部长施瓦辛贝格。

捷克希望将本国的核发电能力从目前全国总发电量的大约30%增加到大约50%。

美国西屋公司和俄罗斯一家公司正在对扩建捷克特梅林核电厂的100亿美元项目竞标。这座核电厂位于临近奥地利边界的布拉格以南地区。

随同克林顿访问的一名美国国务院高层官员说，克林顿将强调西屋公司的安全记录，日本去年发生福岛核事故之后，人们对核反应堆感到担忧。这名官员还说，选择美国公司将有助于捷克脱离俄罗斯，在能源生产领域实现多元化。

** Clinton Pushing US Nuclear Sale**

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is in the Czech Republic for a short visit that includes a push to help a U.S. firm win a nuclear plant construction contract.

Clinton meets Monday with Czech Prime Minister Petr Necas and Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.

The Czech Republic wants to boost its nuclear capacity to produce about half of the country's electricity, up from about 30 percent today.

U.S. firm Westinghouse and a Russian company are bidding on a $10 billion contract to expand the Temelin nuclear plant, located south of Prague near the Austrian border.

A senior State Department official traveling with the secretary says Clinton will stress Westinghouse's safety record amid concerns about nuclear reactors following the disaster in Fukushima, Japan last year. The official also says choosing a U.S. firm would help the Czech Republic diversify its energy production away from Russia.
