**埃及反对派：重新举行‘有缺陷的’宪法公投**

埃及反对派组织说，对伊斯兰主义者支持的宪法草案进行的第一轮全民公决投票出现大规模舞弊，应当重新举行。

埃及主要的反对派联盟“全国拯救阵线”星期天说，他们将不接受非官方的公投结果。他们呼吁在下周六举行第二轮投票前的星期二举行全国抗议示威。

穆尔西总统的支持者穆斯林兄弟会宣布在星期六的投票中获胜。他们说，非官方的计票结果显示，56%的埃及人赞成宪法草案。

穆斯林兄弟会说，在有资格投票的2600万合格选民中，大约三分之一投了票。

第一轮全民公投在埃及27地区中的10个地区举行，包括开罗和亚历山大两个主要城市。第二轮投票下星期六将在其余的地区举行，其中大部分是乡下和宗教保守地区。

一些观察人士预计，第二轮投票将提高整体“赞成“宪法草案的选票。宪法草案获得通过只需要简单多数。
** Egyptian Opposition: Re-stage 'Flawed' Constitutional Referendum**

Egyptian opposition groups say the first round of a referendum on an Islamist-backed constitution was marred by widespread violations and should be re-staged.

Egypt's main opposition coalition, the National Salvation Front, said Sunday it will not accept any unofficial referendum results. They called for nationwide demonstrations Tuesday before the second round is held next Saturday.

The Muslim Brotherhood, backers of President Mohamed Morsi, claimed victory in Saturday's vote, saying unofficial tallies showed 56 percent approval of the draft constitution.

The Brotherhood said turnout was about one-third of the 26 million people eligible to vote.

The first round of the referendum was held in 10 of Egypt's 27 regions, including the two main cities of Cairo and Alexandria. A second round will be held in Egypt's remaining provinces, most of which are rural and religiously conservative.

Some observers expect the second round to boost the overall "yes" vote for the draft constitution, which requires only a simple majority for passage.

** Obama Joins Mourners in Town Shattered by School Shooting**
U.S. President Barack Obama has vowed to use all his power to make sure that tragedies like Friday's killing of 20 children and six adults at an elementary school are never repeated.

Mr. Obama joined mourners Sunday night in ((the northeastern town of)) Newtown, Connecticut where a gunman's rampage killed the 26 people. He told those gathered for a nighttime vigil for the victims that they are not alone in their grief. The president said people across the country are mourning with them.

Mr. Obama said the nation is left with hard questions after the shooting. He noted this was the fourth mass shooting incident that has occurred since the start of his presidency almost four years ago.


Earlier in the evening, the president met privately with the families of those who lost loved ones at Sandy Hook Elementary School, and to thank the first responders to the tragedy.
