Burma's president declared a state of emergency Sunday night for a riot-hit western state, wracked by deadly sectarian violence between Buddhists and Muslims.

Thein Sein warned in a televised address to the nation that if the violence in Rakhine state spreads further, it could put the country's moves toward democracy in danger.

He invoked the emergency measure following three days of violence in Rakhine state between Buddhists and Muslims, in which at least seven people were killed and hundreds of buildings were set ablaze.

The Burmese leader said that violent attacks fueled by "hatred and revenge based on religion and nationality" could spread to other parts of the country. He said if that happens, the country's stability and peace, democratization process and development could be severely affected.

On Saturday, the Burmese government sent additional security forces to Rakhine, near the border with Bangladesh, to restore peace and established a curfew.
