埃及几个伊斯兰组织呼吁在星期五举行大规模抗议活动。目前埃及民众正在紧张等待当局公布首次自由竞争的总统决选的正式结果。

成千上万抗议者在开罗的解放广场露营，谴责临时执政的埃及军方攫取权力，并要求当局公布上星期总统决选的结果。

总统决选结果本来定于星期四公布，但埃及选举委员会决定推迟公布，理由是该委员会需要时间来调查竞选双方提出的舞弊申诉。

穆斯林兄弟会曾经警告说，如果该组织的总统候选人穆尔西未被宣布为总统决选的获胜者，民众和军方执政者就将发生对抗。

穆尔西和前总理沙菲克都宣称自己在总统决选中获胜，双方的支持者都曾扬言，如果己方的候选人败选，就要提出挑战。

埃及官方媒体中东通讯社报道说，选举委员会可能在星期六或星期天宣布总统决选结果。

** Egypt Braces for Protests, Awaits Election Results**

Several Islamist groups are calling for mass protests in Egypt on Friday, as the country nervously awaits the official results of its first freely-contested presidential elections.

Thousands of protesters camped out overnight in Cairo's iconic Tahrir Square to denounce a power grab by Egypt's interim military rulers and to call on officials to release the results of last week's runoff.

Egypt's election commission has postponed the results, which were due to be released Thursday, because it says it needs time to investigate fraud allegations by both candidates.

Muslim Brotherhood officials have warned of a confrontation between the people and the ruling military if its candidate, Muhammad Morsi, is not named the winner.

Both Morsi and former prime minister Ahmed Shafiq are claiming victory, and supporters of both men have threatened a backlash should their candidate lose.

Egypt's official MENA news agency is reporting that the election commission could announce the elections results on Saturday or Sunday.
