**埃及抗议者在总统官邸外露营**

埃及抗议者在开罗解放广场和总统官邸外面露营，要求穆尔西总统下台。

星期三，一些抗议者誓言不会离开，直到穆尔西取消上月颁布的有关授予他自己不受司法监督的广泛权力的政令。

星期二，埃及防暴警察在总统官邸外面发射催泪弹，数万名抗议者聚集在那里，同时穆尔西在总统官邸内处理公务。警察试图阻止大批人群冲进总统官邸。不过，警察很快撤退，他们让游行群众通过一个栅栏，然后爬到总统官邸的墙上。埃及官员说，穆尔西在示威游行的过程中离开了总统官邸。

很多游行民众高呼在推翻前极权总统穆巴拉克的起义中使用的同样的反政府口号。

抗议活动领导人称星期二的游行是对穆尔西的最后警告，他们要求穆尔西撤回他颁发的政令。他们同时还抗议一个宪法草案。反对人士说，该宪法草案是由伊斯兰主义者草拟的，完全没有采纳世俗人士和自由派人士的意见。

**Egyptian Protesters Camp out at Presidential Palace **

Egyptian protesters are camped out at Cairo's Tahrir Square and in front of the presidential palace to urge President Mohamed Morsi to step down.

Some of the protesters Wednesday have vowed not to leave until Mr. Morsi abolishes a decree he issued last month granting him sweeping powers that place him above review from the judiciary.

On Tuesday, Egyptian riot police fired tear gas outside the presidential palace, where tens of thousands of protesters had gathered as Mr. Morsi was inside conducting business. Police tried to stop the crowd from storming the palace but soon retreated and let the marchers through a barrier and up to the palace walls. Egyptian officials say Mr. Morsi had left the palace during the march.

Many of the marchers chanted the same anti-government slogans used in the uprising that toppled former authoritarian president Hosni Mubarak.

Protest leaders called Tuesday's march a last warning to Mr. Morsi to back down from his decree. They are also against a draft constitution that the opposition says was drawn up by Islamists, without input from secularists and liberals.

**Death Toll from Philippine Typhoon Passes 200**

Philippine officials say the death toll from Typhoon Bopha, the most powerful storm to hit the country this year, has risen above 200, with dozens still missing.

Rescuers scrambled Wednesday to reach areas devastated by the storm, which is still packing winds of up to 160 kilometers per hour as it moves across the south-central Philippines.

Many those confirmed killed were in the hard-hit mining southern province of Compostela Valley. Dozens more were killed by flash floods in Davao Oriental province, which lies along the coast.

The military used helicopters to rush aid and heavy equipment to many areas that are isolated due to power outages, lack of communications, and destroyed roads and bridges.

Bopha made landfall Tuesday with winds of up to 210 kilometers per hour. Forecasters say the now weakening storm is headed for popular resort areas in the western Philippines before it heads for the South China Sea on Thursday.
