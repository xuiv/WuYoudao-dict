**IMF：中国经济即将软着陆**

国际货币基金组织说，由于对中国出口产品的需求减少以及对国内缓急次序的重新考量影响到经济发展，中国经济将进入“软着陆”过程。

国际货币基金组织星期三发表的报告说，预计今年中国经济增长率将降至8%，并指出欧元区的债务危机是中国经济面临的主要外部威胁。

这份报告说，中国过去一年期间遏制通货膨胀取得了进展，特别是在抑制食品价格方面。

国际货币基金组织建议中国尽力实现发展目标，并争取将经济转型，使其更依赖于国内消费，而不是主要依赖出口。

国际货币基金组织的报告还说，人民币币值被“中度低估”。

** China'a Economy Set for 'Soft Landing' **

The International Monetary Fund says China's economy is undergoing a "soft landing" as weaker demand for its exports and a rebalancing of domestic priorities affect the country's growth.

In a report Wednesday, the IMF said it expects China's growth to slow to 8 percent this year, and cites the eurozone debt crisis as the main outside risk to the economy.

The report says China has made progress in taming inflation during the past year, especially among food prices.

The IMF advises China to do what it can to meet its growth targets, and to work toward transforming its economy to be more reliant on domestic consumption rather than on exports.

**克林顿：美国扩大对叙利亚反对派的帮助**

美国国务卿希拉里?克林顿说，美国正在扩大帮助叙利亚反政府武装推翻阿萨德总统的努力。

克林顿没有披露详情，但是她星期二说，美国提供了医疗和通讯支持等非致命性援助。她说，华盛顿正在联合国安理会以外进行努力，俄罗斯和中国在安理会三次否决了对阿萨德政府采取强有力行动的决议案。

克林顿说，叙利亚反对派正在控制叙利亚越来越多的地区。她表示，这些地区最终将成为一个安全港，成为采取更多行动的基地。克林顿说，反对派必须准备开始组建临时政府，保护所有叙利亚人的权利，保障大量化学武器和生物武器的安全。

**Clinton: US Increasing Help for Syrian Rebels **

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton says the United States is increasing its efforts to help Syrian rebels fighting to topple President Bashar al-Assad.

Clinton gave no details, but she said Tuesday that the U.S. is giving such non-lethal aid as medical and communications support. She said Washington is working outside of the U.N. Security Council, where Russia and China have vetoed three resolutions that would have taken strong action against the Assad government.

The secretary said the Syrian opposition is seizing control of more and more territory, which she says will eventually become a safe haven and a base for more operations. She said the opposition must be ready to start work on an interim government that protects the rights of all Syrians and safeguards the stockpile of chemical and biological weapons.
