**阿萨德盟友真主党加入叙内战 与哈马斯分歧扩大**

叙利亚总统阿萨德的盟友黎巴嫩真主党激进分子看来正在加入叙利亚的内战。与此同时，阿萨德与他过去的盟友巴勒斯坦激进组织哈马斯的分歧正在扩大。

西方媒体星期二引用黎巴嫩消息人士和叙利亚活动人士的话说，一名真主党头目和两名战士在靠近黎巴嫩北部的叙利亚城镇库萨尔被打死。报道说，这三名真主党成员上个周末在叙利亚反政府力量的伏击中丧生。

叙利亚反政府力量曾指责真主党帮助阿萨德总统镇压为反对专制统治而进行了一年半的起义。在这场内战中，黎巴嫩真主党一直在政治上坚定支持叙利亚总统，但没有承认过在叙利亚参与军事行动。

真主党已经确认了丧生的这名指挥官是纳西夫，称这三名成员在圣战中阵亡，但没有透露他们战死的地点。真主党的电视台星期二报道了在贝卡山谷为他们举行的葬礼。

另一方面，叙利亚国家电视台尖锐批评阿萨德过去的盟友哈马斯领导人梅沙尔。这家电视台在星期一播放的社论中指责梅沙尔背弃叙利亚政府，背叛巴勒斯坦的事业。

这篇评论看来是回应梅沙尔星期天出席土耳其执政党在安卡拉主办的一个会议。土耳其总理埃尔多安是阿萨德在该地区最主要的批评者之一

** Syrian Conflict Draws in Assad Ally Hezbollah, Widens His Rift with Hamas**

Syria's civil war appears to be drawing in Lebanese Hezbollah militants allied to President Bashar al-Assad while at the same time widening a rift between the Syrian leader and his former Palestinian militant allies Hamas.

In reports published Tuesday, Western news agencies quote Lebanese sources and Syrian activists as saying that a senior Hezbollah commander and two other Hezbollah fighters have been killed near the Syrian town of Qusair, bordering northern Lebanon. The reports say the three Hezbollah men were killed in a Syrian rebel ambush on Saturday or Sunday.

Syrian rebels have accused Hezbollah of helping President Assad to fight an 18-month uprising against his autocratic rule. The Lebanese militant group has maintained strong political support for the Syrian president during the conflict but has not admitted to any military activity inside Syria.

Hezbollah identified the slain Hezbollah commander as Ali Hussein Nassif. It said he and the other militants were killed while engaging in jihad duties but did not disclose the location. Hezbollah's al-Manar television network broadcast the funerals of the fighters in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley on Tuesday.

In another development, Syrian state television has made a scathing verbal attack on Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal, a former ally of Mr. Assad. In an editorial broadcast late Monday, the network accused Mashaal of turning his back on the Syrian government and betraying the Palestinian cause.

The commentary appeared to be a reaction to Mashaal's appearance at an Ankara conference organized by Turkey's ruling party on Sunday. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been one of President Assad's strongest critics in the region.

**媒体报道：白宫考虑无人机打击北非基地组织**

美国白宫拒绝证实或否认媒体报道的美国正在考虑使用无人飞机打击基地组织在北非的分部。

华盛顿邮报星期二报道，白宫已经召开秘密会议，考虑单方面袭击伊斯兰马格里布基地组织。

这个组织不断巩固了在北非尤其是在马里北部的势力。今年早些时候，马里北部被与基地组织结盟的伊斯兰激进分子控制。

美国国家安全委员会发言人威尔多没有对报道中的细节发表评论。

他在一份声明中说，“总统已表明消灭基地组织网络的目标，我们每天都在朝这个目标努力。”威尔多补充说，“我们不会公开有关讨论和政策的细节。”

华盛顿邮报引用美国一位高级反恐官员的话说，有关会议着重讨论如何帮助该地区国家的军队打击基地组织。这位据信参与了讨论的官员又说，官员们也在探讨在基地组织得不到遏制的情况下美国直接干预的可能性。

五角大楼发言人利特尔说，美国正在注视有关局势，并准备好向该地区的政府提供帮助。

** Report: White House Mulling Possible Drone Strikes in North Africa **

The White House has declined to confirm or deny a report that says it is considering whether to carry out drone strikes against al-Qaida's branch in North Africa.

The Washington Post reported Tuesday the White House has held secret meetings to consider unilateral action against al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, or AQIM.

The group has become increasingly entrenched in North Africa, especially in northern Mali, which fell earlier this year to Islamist militants allied with al-Qaida.

National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor did not comment on specifics in the article.

In a statement, he said "the president has been clear about his goal to destroy al-Qaida's network and we work toward that goal every day," Vietor said. He added, "We aren't going to get into the specifics of any of these discussions or policy prescriptions."

The Post quotes a top U.S. counterterrorism official as saying the talks are focused on helping regional militaries battle al-Qaida. But the official, who is reportedly involved in the talks, added they are also looking at possible direct U.S. intervention if the terror group goes unchecked.

Pentagon spokesman George Little says the situation is being monitored and the United States is ready to help states in the region.
