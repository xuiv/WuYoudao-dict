**美欧日要求WTO仲裁中国限制稀土出口案**

美国、欧盟和日本要求世界贸易组织就其与中国围绕限制稀土出口问题的争端进行仲裁。

美国贸易代表科克说，以公平与平等的方式获得稀土对于美国工人和制造商至关重要，中国在加入世贸组织时曾经明确表示同意这样做。

世界市场90%以上17种个别的稀土来自中国。美国、欧盟和日本指责中国限制稀土出口，以使中国工业在世界市场上获得不公平的优势。

中国官员说，中国出于环保方面的考虑，必须对稀土开采有所节制。

美国今年3月曾提出申诉，世贸组织做出了不利于中国的裁决。但美国、欧盟和日本官员仍对中国方面的反应表示不满意。

** US, EU, Japan Bring Rare Earths Case Against China to WTO **

The United States, European Union, and Japan have asked the World Trade Organization to settle their dispute with China over restricted exports of rare earths
.
U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk says it is vital that U.S. workers and manufacturers get fair and equal access to such raw materials, which China specifically agreed to do when it joined the WTO.

More than 90 percent of 17 individual rare earths come from China. The United States, EU, and Japan accuse China of restricting such exports to give its own industries an unfair advantage on the world market.

Chinese officials say they must conserve rare earths and metals for environmental reasons.

The WTO ruled against China in an earlier complaint filed by the United States in March. But U.S, European, and Japanese officials are still not satisfied with China's response.

**New York Times Launches Chinese-Language Website**

The New York Times has launched a Chinese-language news website aimed at China's massive online population.

The paper said in a statement the site, (www.cn.nytimes.com) which went active Thursday, hopes to draw readers from China's "growing number of educated, affluent citizens."

China has an estimated 500 million Internet users, making it the world's largest online population. But Chinese net users experience the web much differently than the rest of the world, due to a massive government censorship system that blocks content deemed objectionable.

The Times acknowledged Wednesday that government censors sometimes block material from its English website. But it said it was hopeful that government officials would be "receptive" to its Chinese-language Website.
