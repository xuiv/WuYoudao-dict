Aung San Suu Kyi Makes Debut in Burma's Parliament

Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi has made her historic debut in parliament.

The Nobel Peace Prize winner took her seat in Burma's lower house of parliament for the first time Monday in the administrative capital, Naypyidaw. Aung San Suu Kyi's presence marks a new phase in her long struggle to bring democracy to her homeland.

She joined fellow members of the National League for Democracy party in parliament, along with other legislators. Parliament is still dominated by the military and its political allies.

NLD, once dissident outsiders, is now a mainstream political party, following Burma's landmark April elections and other sweeping changes by the new government.
