**奥巴马访东南亚期间将重视人权问题**

白宫官员向批评人士保证，奥巴马总统在即将访问东南亚期间不会漠视人权问题。

奥巴马总统将于星期六开始为期三天的亚洲之行，其间将访问柬埔寨、泰国和缅甸。自从当选连任以来，这是奥巴马首次出国访问，因此更凸显了美国政府将重点移向亚洲的重要性。

这次出访的一个引入注目之处将是奥巴马在缅甸的短暂停留，这将是美国总统首次访问这个曾由军人统治的国家。

一些人权组织反对奥巴马访问缅甸，认为奥巴马等缅甸实行更多改革之后再进行访问。

**Obama to Highlight Human Rights on Southeast Asian Trip**

White House officials are assuring critics that President Barack Obama will not ignore human rights concerns during his upcoming visit to Southeast Asia.

President Obama leaves Saturday for a three-day tour of Cambodia, Thailand and Burma. It is his first foreign trip since being re-elected, underscoring the importance of the administration's new focus on the region.

A highlight of the trip will be Mr. Obama's brief stop in Burma, the first ever visit by a U.S. president to the former military-ruled state.

**彼得雷乌斯就美驻利比亚领馆遇袭在国会作证**

星期五，前美国中央情报局长彼得雷乌斯在美国国会众议院情报委员会就今年9月美国驻利比亚城市班加西领馆遭到致命袭击一事作证。

美国参众两院的情报委员会星期四开始就美国驻利比亚大使史蒂文斯和其他三名美国人在那次袭击中遇害事件举行闭门听证。星期四，美国情报和反恐部门的官员提供了证词。

很多议员关注美国驻班加西领馆是否得到了足够的安全保护，以及奥巴马政府是否事后试图隐瞒有关信息，以避免在11月6日总统选举之前出现尴尬局面。

上星期，美国联邦调查局发现彼得雷乌斯与他的传记作者布罗德维尔有婚外情后，他辞去了中央情报局长职务。这一事件使有关方面担心国家安全可能受到威胁。

美国司法部长霍尔德星期四说，他“非常确信”彼得雷乌斯丑闻没有对国家安全构成威胁。

**Petraeus Testifies on Capitol Hill about Libya Attack **

Former CIA director David Petraeus testifies Friday before the House Intelligence Committee about the deadly September attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya.

Both the House and Senate Intelligence Committees began closed-door hearings Thursday on the attack in which U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed. U.S. intelligence and counterterrorism officials testified Thursday.

Many lawmakers are concerned over whether there was adequate security at the consulate, and if the Obama administration later attempted to hide information to avoid any embarrassment before the November 6 presidential election.

Petraeus resigned his post as the leader of the Central Intelligence Agency last week following an FBI investigation that uncovered his extramarital affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell. The incident raised concerns about a possible breach of national security.

Attorney General Eric Holder said Thursday that he felt "very secure" that there was no national security breach in the Petraeus scandal.
