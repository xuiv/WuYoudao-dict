**美国国防部调查驻阿美军司令艾伦**

美国国防部正在调查美国驻阿富汗军队最高指挥官约翰·艾伦将军据称与一名女子的“不当联络”，这名女子涉及一桩导致美国中央情报局长彼得雷乌斯辞职的丑闻。

美国国防部一名高层官员星期二说，五角大楼正在审查艾伦将军与吉尔·凯利之间两万多页的电子邮件以及其他形式的联络。这名官员没有具体说明这些文件的性质。

凯利是彼得雷乌斯的朋友，她曾向联邦调查局报告一名女子向她发送带有威胁性的电子邮件，而这名女子与彼得雷乌斯有婚外情，于是最终导致彼得雷乌斯于上星期五辞职。

五角大楼发言人利特尔说，联邦调查局星期天把有关艾伦将军的问题告知国防部，随后国防部长帕内塔责成国防部总检察长展开调查。

艾伦将军否认自己有任何不当行为，在调查进行期间，他将继续担任驻阿美军司令。

** Head of US Forces in Afghanistan Under the Pentagon's Investigation**

The U.S. Defense Department is investigating General John Allen, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, for alleged "inappropriate communications" with a woman involved in the scandal that led to the resignation of Central Intelligence Agency chief David Petraeus.

A senior defense official said Tuesday that the Pentagon is reviewing more than 20,000 pages of emails and other communications between General Allen and Jill Kelley. The official did not specify the nature of the documents.

Kelley is a friend of Petraeus, and it was her complaint to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about threatening emails from the woman with whom Petraeus had an affair that ultimately led to his resignation last Friday.

Pentagon spokesman George Little said the FBI brought the matter involving General Allen to the Defense Department Sunday, and that Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has directed the department's inspector-general to investigate.

General Allen has denied any wrongdoing, and will retain his command position in Afghanistan while the probe continues.

**美国考虑2014年后的阿富汗驻军计划**

美国国防部长帕内塔说，五角大楼和白宫正在商讨2014年从阿富汗撤出战斗部队后美国在阿富汗的军事存在问题。

星期一，帕内塔在乘坐军用飞机前往澳大利亚途中对记者说，驻阿富汗北约联军司令艾伦将军提交了有关支持反恐和训练阿富汗军队的计划。

美国和阿富汗今年5月签署一项战略伙伴关系协议，概要说明了两国未来的关系。这项协议没有具体规定美国驻军人数，但保证美国在国际战斗部队撤离阿富汗的至少10年内为阿富汗提供援助。

** US Weighing Troop Plans for Post-2014 Afghanistan**

U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta says the Pentagon and the White House are discussing what presence the U.S. military will have in Afghanistan following the withdrawal of combat troops in 2014.

Panetta told reporters Monday aboard a military aircraft traveling to Australia that the head of the U.S.-led NATO coalition in Afghanistan, General John Allen, has presented plans to support counter-terrorism and training for Afghan forces.


The United States and Afghanistan signed a strategic partnership agreement in May outlining the future relationship between the two countries. It does not specify any specific troop presence, but pledges American aid for Afghanistan for at least a decade after international combat troops leave the country.
