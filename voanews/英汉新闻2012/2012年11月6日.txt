**奥巴马罗姆尼大选前最后冲刺**

在美国总统大选前夜，美国总统奥巴马和他的共和党竞选对手罗姆尼在具有重要政治意义的关键州做最后的竞选努力。

奥巴马星期一在威斯康辛州和俄亥俄州进行竞选活动，随后再到艾奥华州举行最后一次集会。奥巴马2008年竞选总统时，在艾奥华州赢得了首场初选胜利。奥巴马谈到自己执政期间所取得的成果，包括救助美国的汽车工业以及击毙本拉登，但他表示，还需要一届总统任期来完成预定的工作。

罗姆尼在佛罗里达、维吉尼亚和俄亥俄三州开始星期一的竞选活动，随后在新罕布什尔州举行了一次热闹的夜间集会。一年多前，罗姆尼在新罕布什尔州开始竞选。这位前马萨诸塞州州长说，不论是作为企业家，还是作为政界人士，他的记录都显示能够为国家带来真正改变的是他，而不是奥巴马。

星期二，罗姆尼将在他的家乡波士顿投票，而且将在俄亥俄州和宾夕法尼亚州参加两场最后一刻的选举日活动。奥巴马将和夫人米歇尔星期二将在家乡芝加哥度过。

** Voting Begins in 2012 US Presidential Election**

U.S. President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney have made their final arguments to voters in key political battleground states on the eve of the 2012 presidential campaign.

Mr. Obama made campaign stops Monday in Wisconsin and Ohio, before holding a final rally in Iowa, the state that gave him his first primary victory in his 2008 White House campaign. The Democratic incumbent boasted of his accomplishments during his presidency, including the bailout of the U.S. auto industry and the killing of Osama bin Laden, but said he needed another term to complete his agenda.

Mr. Romney started his day in Florida, Virginia and Ohio, before ending with a rousing late night rally at an arena in New Hampshire, where he launched his campaign more than a year ago. The former Massachusetts governor said his record as both a businessman and politician shows he, and not Mr. Obama, would bring about real change for the nation.

Mr. Romney will vote in his hometown of Boston Tuesday, and has scheduled two last-minute Election Day events in Ohio and Pennsylvania. The president and his wife, Michelle, will spend Tuesday in their home in Chicago.

**报道：被谋杀的英国人海伍德是英国军情六处情报人员**

一家主要美国报纸说，该报发现的证据显示，被前中国高级官员薄熙来的妻子杀死的英国商人海伍德是英国间谍机构军情六处的情报人员。

华尔街日报星期二说，该报经过调查发现，海伍德在去年11月被杀害之前的一年多时间里，一直为英国军情六处提供有关薄熙来家庭的情报。有关调查是基于对英国官员以及海伍德朋友的采访。

今年8月，一家中国法院做出判决，前中共政治局委员薄熙来的妻子谷开来因商业纠纷谋杀41岁的海伍德的罪名成立。海伍德的很多朋友说，中国官方有关这起谋杀案的说法不统一。

英国政府一直试图撇清与海伍德的关系，过去曾有关于他同伦敦情报机构有关联的传言。今年4月，英国外交大臣黑格不同寻常地就有关传言发表评论，坚称海伍德“不是英国任何政府部门的雇员”。

** Murdered Briton Was MI6 Informant: Report**

A major U.S. newspaper says it has found evidence that a British businessman murdered by the wife of Bo Xilai, one of former China's top politicians, was working as an informant for Britain's spy agency, MI6.

The Wall Street Journal said Tuesday its investigation found that Neil Heywood was providing MI6 information on the Bo family for more than a year before he was murdered last November. The investigation was based on interviews with British officials and friends of Heywood.

Gu Kailai, the wife of former Politburo member Bo Xilai, was convicted in August of murdering the 41-year-old Heywood because of what a Chinese court said was a business dispute. Many of Heywood's friends have said there were inconsistencies with the official account of the murder.

The British government has tried to distance itself from Heywood, who was previously rumored to have had links to London's spy agency. In April, Foreign Secretary William Hague took the unusual step of commenting on intelligence matters, insisting that Heywood was "not an employee of the British government in any capacity."
