美国人迎接节日季 保安戒备加强

美国民众星期四庆祝传统节日感恩节，亲友欢聚一堂，享受美味佳肴，观看游行或美式足球比赛，而且对很多人来说，这也是假期购物季节的开始。

但是2017年，包括纽约曼哈顿的梅西感恩节大游行在内的很多庆祝活动都将加强保安。

纽约的梅西感恩节大游行通常会吸引20万人观看。而就在不久前，一位乌兹别克移民驾驶租来的卡车在曼哈顿的自行车道上横冲直撞，撞死8人。

纽约官员说，保安措施包括部署狙击手、满载沙子的自卸卡车和专门查找炸弹的警犬。

纽约警察局说，虽然目前没有任何经证实的威胁，但是将在游行4公里长的曼哈顿街道上部署数以千计的警察。梅西大游行定于美国东部时间上午9点开始。

Security Tight as Americans Begin Holiday Season

Americans will celebrate Thanksgiving Thursday as they traditionally do — gathering with family and friends around tables groaning with food, watching parades and football games, and, for many, starting their holiday shopping.

But the 2017 celebrations, including the iconic Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in Manhattan, will be under close scrutiny.

The parade, which attracts about 200,000 spectators, comes just weeks after an Uzbek migrant is accused of driving a rented truck onto a crowded bike path, killing eight people.

New York officials said security will include police sharpshooters, as well as sand-laden dump trucks and bomb-sniffing dogs.

While they have verified no credible threats, the New York City Police Department said it is deploying thousands of police officers along the 4-kilometer (2.5-mile) route through Manhattan. The parade beings at 9 a.m. EST (1400 UTC).

姆拉迪奇被定罪 波斯尼亚民众欢欣鼓舞

1990年代巴尔干战争期间担任前波斯尼亚塞族军队领导人的姆拉迪奇被海牙的一个国际法庭判定犯有10项种族灭绝、战争罪，以及反人类罪，被判处终身监禁。

法官奥里尔列举了姆拉迪奇在波斯尼亚战争期间犯下的罪行，包括1995年7月13号和14号处决了大约1000名手无寸铁的波斯尼亚和穆斯林男子和男孩，以及1995年7月16号在一家军队农场处决了1000到1200人。

有“波斯尼亚屠夫”之称的姆拉迪奇在宣布判决前对法官大喊：“那是谎言。你在法庭说的一切都是谎言。”随后，他在宣读判决前被带下被告席。

姆拉迪奇在1992年到1995年的波斯尼亚战争期间领导波斯尼亚塞族军队。他指挥了对萨拉热窝的围困。围困期间，萨拉热窝受到狙击手和炮火的攻击，供应被切断，成千上万人丧生。

法官还说，斯雷布雷尼察7000多穆斯林男子和男童被屠杀，姆拉迪奇负有很大的责任。

科索沃对姆拉迪奇的判决表示欢迎。科索沃外交部长说，判决显示了国际公正，并令波斯尼亚战争的受害者满意。

Bosnians Welcome Mladic Conviction

Ratko Mladic, the former general in charge of Bosnian Serb forces during the Balkans war in the early 1990s has been convicted of 10 charges of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes at an international tribunal in The Hague. He was jailed for life.

The presiding judge, Alphons Orie, spelled out the crimes Mladic masterminded during the Bosnian war.

“On 13 and 14 July 1995, approximately 1,000 unarmed Bosnian and Muslim males including children and elderly were executed in Kravica Warehouse. On 16 July 1995 between 1,000 and 1,200 in the Branjevo military farm were summarily executed.”

The so-called “butcher of Bosnia” was led away from the dock before the verdicts were announced, after shouting at the judge, “It's a lie. Everything you said in this courtroom is a lie.”

Ratko Mladic led Bosnian Serbian forces during the 1992-1995 Bosnian war. He oversaw the siege of Sarajevo, where snipers and heavy artillery pounded the city and cut off supplies, killing thousands.

Judges also found that Mladic had, in their words, “significantly contributed” to the massacre at Srebrenica, when more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys were murdered.

Kosovo welcomed the conviction of Mladic. Kosovo’s Foreign Ministry said the verdict marked an act of “international justice and satisfaction for the Bosnia war victims.”
