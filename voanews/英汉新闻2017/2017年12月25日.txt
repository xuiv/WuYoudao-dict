Peru Fujimori granted a medical pardon

Peru's president has granted a medical pardon to jailed former authoritarian leader Alberto Fujimori, who was serving a 25-year sentence for human rights abuses and corruption.

A statement from President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski's office Sunday evening said the pardon was for "humanitarian reasons." AP reports Fujimori has been seeking a pardon for more than a year due to illness.

Fujimori served as president of Peru from 1990 to 2000. He remains a divisive figure in Peru.

He is admired by some Peruvians for combating Maoist rebels, whereas his critics consider him a corrupt dictator.

In 2007, Fujimori was sentenced to six years in jail for bribery and abuse of power.

In 2009, he was sentenced to another 25 years in prison for human rights abuses committed during his time in office, including authorizing killings carried out by death squads.

His daughter Keiko Fujimori is a prominent politician who ran a credible but unsuccessful race for president. On Twitter she called this "A great day for my family. Finally my father is free. This will be a Christmas of hope and joy."

Suicide bombing in Afghan capital kills 6

Afghan officials say a suicide blast early Monday in Kabul killed two intelligence officers and four civilians, while injuring two people.

The bombing occurred near a security check post on a busy road in the capital. The bomber apparently wanted to target Afghan security forces and instead hit a civilian car, said an Interior Ministry spokesman.

The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the blast through its Amaq news agency.

Monday's bombing comes a week after Islamic State claimed an attack on a National Directorate of Security training facility in Kabul.
