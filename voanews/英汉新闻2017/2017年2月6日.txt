UN Says Annual Afghan Child Casualties Rose By 24 Percent

The United Nations recorded an alarming 24 percent spike in conflict-related child casualties in Afghanistan and a three percent rise in total civilian casualties in 2016 compared to the year before.

The violence caused more than 11,400 civilian casualties, including around 3,500 deaths last year, according to the annual report by the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, or UNAMA, released in Kabul Monday.

It attributed 61 percent of civilian deaths and injuries to anti-government elements, mainly the Taliban. UNAMA blamed pro-government forces for causing 24 percent of the casualties, saying it reflected a 46 percent increase compared to 2015.

The report could not ascertain responsibility for 10 percent of the casualties caused by the fighting, while the remaining five percent resulted mainly from explosive remnants of war.

The armed conflict in Afghanistan has claimed the lives of around 25,000 Afghan civilians and injured more than 45,000 since 2009, according to UNAMA.

世卫组织及医学专家警告亚洲医疗费用上升

亚洲由于癌症病患的人数增加以及未来10年中风和痴呆症患者人数不断上升而面临医疗成本日益增加的负担。

亚洲的经济进步带来贫穷急剧减少，但也导致了社会和生活方式的变化，包括饮食的改变和日益增加的城市污染，给各个社区带来的影响日益显现。

世界卫生组织（WHO）表示，在东南亚，晚期癌症每年导致130万人死亡。世卫组织称，每年有880万人死于癌症，其中三分之二在非洲和亚洲。

世卫组织说，癌症、糖尿病、心血管疾病和慢性肺部疾病每年导致4000万人丧生，这在2015年占全世界死亡总人数5600万人的70％。

同时全球医疗成本正在上升。在2015年，癌症药物的支出上升了11.5％，达到1070亿美元，预计到2020年将增加到1500亿美元，这主要是新药和更具针对性药物造成的。

该咨询公司说，中国2016年出现四百万个新的癌症病例，全国医疗支出到2025年将飙升“四倍”，增至12.7万亿元人民币，相当于1.84万亿美元。

WHO, Medical Experts, Warn of Rising Health Costs in Asia

Asia faces a growing burden in treatment costs due to rising numbers of patients diagnosed with cancer, as well as those suffering from stroke and dementia over the next decade.

While Asia’s economic progress has led to sharply lower levels of poverty, it has resulted in social and lifestyles changes ranging from diets to increasing urban pollution, that extract an increasing toll on communities.

The World Health Organization (WHO) says in Southeast Asia, late treatment of cancer results in 1.3 million deaths a year. WHO says of the 8.8 million deaths from cancer annually, two thirds are in Africa and Asia.

Cancers, along with diabetes, cardiovascular and chronic lung diseases, were responsible for 40 million – or 70 percent of the world’s 56 million deaths in 2015, WHO said.

But globally treatment costs are rising. In 2015, the spending on cancer drugs rose by 11.5 percent to $107 billion, and is forecast to rise to $150 billion by 2020 – due largely to the expense of newer and more specialized drugs.

China reported four million new cancer cases in 2016, with the national health bill set to soar “fourfold” to 12.7 trillion yuan ($1.84 trillion) by 2025, the consultants said.
