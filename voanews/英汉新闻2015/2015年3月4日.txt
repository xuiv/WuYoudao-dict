Myanmar Student Protests, Police Continue Standoff

A standoff is continuing for a third day between Myanmar police and student protesters who are trying to march to Yangon to demand changes to an education reform bill.

Student leader Thiha Win Tin told VOA on Wednesday that police continue to surround the activists at a monastery in Letpadan, about 130 kilometers north of Yangon.

Speaking by phone from Letpadan, he said police continue to threaten to arrest the students if they try to continue their march. So far, he said police have not made any arrests and that the activists are sticking to their demands.

The group of more than 1,000 students set off from Mandalay last month to demand Myanmar's military-dominated government scrap a new education reform law.

They say the law will centralize control of universities in Myanmar, also known as Burma. They also want more government spending on education as well as the freedom to organize teachers and students.

以色列领导人发言时, 奥巴马正在参加与欧洲领导人讨论乌克兰和其他问题的视频会议。奥巴马表示，内塔尼亚胡在演讲中没有提出任何新东西。

奥巴马表示，他同意内塔尼亚胡所说，即美以关系牢不可破以及伊朗政权是危险的。

内塔尼亚胡批评奥巴马试图通过谈判与伊朗达成一项核协议，奥巴马在这一点上做出最强烈的反驳。

奥巴马说： “如何防止伊朗获得核武器，因为这会使它更加危险并让它在该地区发挥更大作用，在这个核心问题上，总理没有提供任何可行的选择方案。”

奥巴马为美国领导的核谈判努力进行辩护。他说，达成一项协议防止伊朗获得用来威胁以色列的核武器是最佳方式。

在内塔尼亚胡访问华盛顿期间，奥巴马不准备同他会晤。

Obama: Netanyahu Offered Nothing New

U.S. President Barack Obama was critical of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech before the U.S. Congress, saying the Israeli leader offered no new alternatives on dealing with Iran and its nuclear ambitions.

President Obama told reporters in the Oval Office he did not watch the Israeli leader’s speech to a joint meeting of Congress Tuesday, but he did see the transcript.

“As far as I can tell, there was nothing new,” said Mr. Obama who was taking part in a videoconference with European leaders discussing Ukraine and other issues as the Israeli leader was speaking.

The U.S. leader said he agreed with Mr. Netanyahu when the Israeli prime minister described the U.S.-Israel relationship as unbreakable, and when he called Iran a dangerous regime.

It was on Mr. Netanyahu’s criticism of President Obama’s negotiations for a nuclear deal with Iran that the U.S. leader had the strongest rebuke.

“On the core issue, which is how do we prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, which would make it far more dangerous and would give it scope for even greater action in the region,” President Obama said, “the prime minister didn't offer any viable alternatives.”

President Obama planned no meetings with Mr. Netanyahu during the Israeli leader’s Washington visit.
