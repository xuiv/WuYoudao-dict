**超级碗橄榄球大赛，美国胜似过节**

星期天可谓美国的一个非正式假日。在晚上的超级碗橄榄球大赛时，亿万美国人将在围坐在电视机前，观看这一美国年度最大的体育赛事。

今年第49届超级碗比赛对战双方是来自西雅图的海鹰队与来自波士顿的新英格兰爱国者队。这也是爱国者队第8次进入超级碗决赛。比赛将在中立场地亚利桑那州菲尼克斯市进行。

今年大赛的官方票价为800到1900美元，但是早已抢购一空。开赛前的几个小时内，黄牛票价可高达几千美元一张。然而，大多数美国人将在酒吧和餐厅观看比赛。全国各地还有传统的超级碗派对。

和比赛一样受欢迎的是电视广告。赞助商展示最具创意的广告，希望通过接触庞大的观众提高声誉和销售。今年30秒广告的费用为450万美元。一些公司购买好几分钟的播出时间。

中场休息是超级碗的另一特色。今年的娱乐节目由著名歌星凯蒂·佩里提供。佩里以其服饰奢华，音乐会铺张和个性独特而著称。

在比赛预测推算中新英格兰队稍稍领先。据称新英格兰爱国者队将在亚利桑那州凤凰城大学体育场比赛中击败海鹰队。

Americans Ready for Super Bowl Sunday

Sunday is an unofficial holiday in the United States as millions of Americans gather in front of televisions for the annual National Football League championship; the Super Bowl.

This year's game is the 49th and features the defending champion Seattle Seahawks playing three-time winners the New England Patriots. The Patriots are making a record eighth Super Bowl appearance.

The official cost for tickets this year ranges from $800 to $1,900, but they are nearly impossible to get at those prices. Ticket brokers are charging several thousand dollars per ticket in the hours before game time.

However, most Americans will watch the game in bars and restaurants, and at traditional Super Bowl parties in homes across the nation.

Just as popular as the game are the television commercials, with sponsors presenting their most creative advertisements in hopes of boosting reputations and sales by reaching the huge audience. The cost of a 30-second ad this year is $4.5 million, with some companies buying several minutes of air time.

The halftime show is yet another major feature of the Super Bowl, with this year's entertainment provided by pop star Katy Perry. She is known for her lavish costumes, extravagant concerts and unique personality.

As for the game itself, the oddsmakers have made New England a slight favorite to beat the Seahawks in Sunday night's matchup at the University of Phoenix stadium in (Glendale,) Arizona (in the southwestern U.S.).

**乌克兰冲突双方周六和谈未获进展**

乌克兰政府和亲俄罗斯分离分子的和平会谈星期六没有取得任何成果，乌克兰东部的冲突继续发生，双方武装人员以及平民仍有伤亡。

在明斯克举行的和谈进行了几小时后休会。俄罗斯、乌克兰和欧安会的三方联合声明说，前来参加和谈的反政府武装控制区代表拒绝讨论落实停火协议和撤走重武器的问题，而表示希望重新审议作为停止敌对基础的明斯克协议。

双方去年9月达成的停火协议不断被打破，上星期完全破裂。亲俄罗斯武装宣布开展扩大其控制区的新一轮攻势。

反政府武装控制的顿涅茨克警察总监说，战略交通枢纽德巴尔切夫镇星期六受到的炮击中有12名平民丧生。德巴尔切夫位于顿涅茨克东北方向，是与反政府武装控制的另一个重要城镇卢甘斯克连接的重要环节。

乌克兰政府仍然基本控制着德巴尔切夫的铁路和公路要道，但是那里被切断水源、供电和汽油已经数天。

乌克兰国防部长说，政府军与亲俄罗斯武装作战一天以来，有15名军人丧生。

俄罗斯去年并吞克里米亚半岛，冲突4月份爆发以来，已经有5100多人丧生。面对冲突最近升级，乌克兰总统波罗申科呼吁举行新一轮和平谈判。

Peace talks between Ukraine and pro-Russia separatists went nowhere Saturday, as fighting raged in the country's east, killing both soldiers and civilians.

The talks in Minsk were adjourned after several hours. A statement from the Trilateral Contact Group said that the representatives from the rebel-held areas of Ukraine did not come to the talks prepared to discuss implementation of a cease-fire and withdrawal of heavy weapons. Instead, the group said the rebels wanted to revisit the Minsk Protocol that laid the groundwork for a cessation of hostilities.

The cease-fire the sides agreed to in September has been repeatedly violated and collapsed completely last week when rebels announced the start of a new offensive designed to expand their territory.

Shelling in the strategic transport hub of Debaltseve killed 12 civilians Saturday, according to the police chief of the rebel-held Donetsk region. Debaltseve is located northeast of the city of Donetsk, connecting it with Luhansk, another major rebel stronghold.

The government still retains primary control of the vital rail and road junction, which has been without water, power and gas for days.

In addition to the civilian deaths, Ukraine's defense minister, Stepan Poltorak, announced the deaths of 15 soldiers across the east in the past day of fighting with Russia-backed separatists.
