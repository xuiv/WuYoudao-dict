**10美元钞票上将出现美国女性画像**

2020年，10美元钞票上将出现一名著名美国女性的画像。

新画像将取代美国首任财政部长亚历山大·汉密尔顿的画像。自上世纪20年末以来，10美元钞票上一直印有汉密尔顿的画像。新版10美元钞票将在赋予女性选举权的宪法修正案正式通过100周年之际开始发行。

星期三，美国财政部长杰克·卢宣布了这一计划。他说，财政部将发起一个名为“新10元”的社交媒体运动，并将举行一系列公民会议，征集人们的想法，以确定在新版10美元钞票上印哪位女性的画像。

1896年，美国首任总统的夫人玛莎·华盛顿的画像印在一美元银圆券上，此后美元纸币上再没有出现过女性画像。

US Plans to Put Portrait of Historic Woman on Currency

The U.S. $10 bill will feature the portrait of a notable U.S. woman by 2020.

The new image will replace that of Alexander Hamilton, the nation's first Treasury Secretary, whose portrait has graced the $10 bill since the late 1920s. The redesigned currency will debut in time for the 100th anniversary of the formal ratification of the constitutional amendment that gave women the right to vote.

Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew announced the plans for the new redesign Wednesday. Lew said the Treasury Department will launch a social media campaign dubbed "The New 10" to solicit ideas on whose portrait should be chosen for the new bill, along with a series of public meetings. He will reveal his decision sometime this year.

A woman's portrait has not been printed on U.S. paper money since 1896, when Martha Washington, the wife of the first U.S. president, was shown on a one dollar silver certificate.


**联合国:世界难民人数达新高**

联合国难民署说，世界各地的战争、暴力和迫害造成的难民人数已经达到新高，被迫离开家园的人正在迅速增多。

联合国难民署星期四发表的一份新报告说，到2014年底，将近6千万人流离失所。这个数字比一年前增加了约8百万，比10年前增加了约2千万。自2013年以来，增加的难民人数超过了以往任何一年。

大量人员外流始于2011年，这是叙利亚内战带来的后果。但在以往五年期间，非洲、亚洲和欧洲的武装冲突和迫害也迫使人们逃离家园。去年，每天有4万2千5百人因某种形式的暴力而离开家园。

叙利亚是目前世界上最大的难民输出国，其次是阿富汗和索马里。叙利亚的邻国土耳其是世界上收容难民最多的国家。希腊和意大利目前都有大批希望在欧洲定居的难民。

UNHCR Report: Record Number of People Forced to Flee Homes

The United Nations refugee agency says a record number of people worldwide have been displaced by war, violence and persecution and the number of people forced to flee their homes is rapidly growing.

In a new report issued Thursday, the UNHCR says that at the end of 2014, there were nearly 60 million forcibly displaced people, about 8 million more than the year before and about 20 million more than a decade ago. The increase since 2013 was the highest ever in a single year.

A major exodus of people from their homes started in 2011 with the eruption of civil war in Syria; but, in the past five years, armed conflicts and persecution also have sent people fleeing from their homes in Africa, Asia and Europe. Last year 42,500 people a day left their homes due to some type of violence.

Syria is currently the world's biggest producer of displaced people and refugees, followed by Afghanistan and Somalia. Syria's neighbor, Turkey, has become the world's top refugee-hosting nation.

Greece and Italy are swamped with refugees who want to settle in Europe.
