**美国民众缅怀阵亡将士**

美国各州民众将在星期一一年一度的阵亡将士纪念日缅怀那些在战争中牺牲的军人。

全国许多社区将以游行、爱国音乐会和典礼的形式来悼念那些阵亡将士，而其他人则会以安静缅怀的方式度过阵亡将士纪念日。

星期日，数千人骑着摩托车在首都华盛顿参加了一年一度的称为“滚雷”的摩托车大游行，以此来引起人们对战俘和战争失踪人员的关注。

奥巴马总统在发表每周例行讲话时纪念阵亡将士纪念日，他在讲话中向那些为国家献出了生命的男女将士致敬。

他说，今年的节日尤其具有意义，因为它是阿富汗战事结束后的第一个阵亡将士“纪念日”。

第一次大规模纪念阵亡将士的活动于美国内战结束三年后的1868年在阿灵顿公墓举行。血腥的美国内战造成60多万人死亡。起初，这个节日被称为“装饰日”。

许多美国人在阵亡将士纪念日这一天不用上班或上学。三天的长周末也被民间视为夏天度假季节的开始。许多家庭会在这个小长假去野餐，或去海边、公园旅行，或去野营。

Memorial Day Honors US War Dead

States will honor those who died in military service with the annual Memorial Day holiday Monday.

While many communities across the country will honor the war dead with parades, patriotic concerts and ceremonies, others will mark the day with quiet reflection on those who have lost their lives in military service.

On Sunday, thousands of motorcycle riders rolled through Washington for the annual Rolling Thunder rally to call attention to prisoners of war and those missing in action.

President Barrack Obama used his weekly address to commemorate Memorial Day and pay tribute to the men and women in uniform who have given their lives in service to our country.

He said the holiday is especially meaningful this year because it is the first Memorial Day since the war in Afghanistan ended.

The first large-scale observance of what was originally called Decoration Day took place at Arlington cemetery in 1868, three years after the bloody U.S. Civil War that killed more than 600,000 people.

Many Americans have the day off from work and school, and the three-day weekend is seen as the unofficial start of the summer vacation season. Many families have picnics or make trips to the beach, parks or campgrounds.


**波兰民众投票选举新一任总统**

波兰民众星期天投票选举新一任总统。这是一次“决选”。两位参选人分别是现任总统科莫罗夫斯基和挑战他的保守派人士杜达。

杜达这个月早些时候在第一轮投票中略微领先。分析人士形容杜达在上一轮投票中的领先是波兰政坛近年来最令人“吃惊”的震动，因为在第一轮投票之前，大部分民意调查都显示，在很多问题上都持有中间立场的现任总统，可以很轻松地领先。

科莫罗夫斯基是一位历史学家，从前也担任过波兰的国防部长。他是2010年首次当选总统的。这次是竞选连任，他的竞选纲领主要围绕着国家安全主题。

被称为是保守派人士的杜达，其竞选纲领是要保证一旦当选以后，将会降低波兰民众的退休年龄，他同时还说要为大家减税，并且警告人们说，假如波兰方面采用欧元作为通用货币的话，波兰国内的物价将无疑会上涨。

在波兰，总理负责政府的日常事务，但是总统是国家军队的统帅，并且也在外交政策和立法方面有决定权。总统的每一任期是五年。


Poles Vote for New President

Voters in Poland are going to the polls Sunday to cast ballots in a tight, runoff presidential election between incumbent Bronislaw Komorowski and challenger Andrzej Duda.

Mr. Duda won the first-round vote earlier this month. Analysts described Mr. Duda's win as one of the biggest shocks in Polish politics in recent years, given that pre-election surveys signaled a relatively easy win for the centrist incumbent.

Mr. Komorowski, a historian and former defense minister, was first elected in 2010 and campaigned for a second term largely on national security challenges.

Conservative Mr. Duda campaigned on promises to lower Poland's retirement age. He also advocated tax cuts and warned of rising prices, if Poland adopts the euro currency.

In Poland, the prime minister leads the government, but the president - elected for a five-year term - heads the armed forces, and has a say in foreign policy and the passage of legislation.
