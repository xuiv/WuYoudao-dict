Leaders Set to Discuss Ukraine Peace Plan as Fighting Continues

Deadly fighting continued Wednesday in eastern Ukraine, as the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany prepared to hold a summit on the conflict that has killed more than 5,300 people since last April.

At least two people died in the rebel-held eastern city of Donetsk when a shell hit a bus station, according to rebel officials and emergency personnel. Military officials also said rebel attacks near Debaltseve had killed at least 19 soldiers and wounded 78 others.

Ahead of Wednesday's talks in Belarus, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said Ukraine and the European Union would speak "with one voice." He earlier described the four-nation summit as one of the last chances to end the fighting between his country's forces and pro-Russian separatists.

Mr. Poroshenko said Wednesday he would not hesitate to introduce marital law throughout the country if the conflict escalates.

The White House said U.S. President Barack Obama spoke by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin and urged him to support a peace deal for Ukraine.


**美英法驻也门使馆因局势动荡关闭**

也门安全局势日趋恶化，美国、英国和法国宣布关闭驻也门大使馆。

美国国务院星期二晚间宣布，驻也门使馆人员已转移出萨那。英国星期三清晨表示，英国驻也门使馆人员已经撤离。法国定于星期五关闭大使馆。

美国国务院发言人莎琪发表声明说：“最近的单方面行动干扰了也门的政治转型过程，由此可能再度发生暴力，对萨那的也门人和外交人员构成威胁。美国仍然坚决支持所有也门人继续致力于在也门实现和平、繁荣和统一。我们将研究所有选择方案，在当地局势改善后重返萨那。”

美国、英国和法国都建议本国公民不要前往也门，并敦促目前在也门的本国公民撤离。

数月来，也门政局动荡。什叶派胡塞叛乱分子上个月占领了哈迪总统的官邸，迫使哈迪及其内阁辞职。上星期五，叛乱分子正式接管权力，宣布解散议会，并将组建一个新的总统委员会来处理政务。

US, Britain, France Close Yemen Embassies Due to Unrest

The United States, Britain and France announced the closure of their embassies in Yemen because of deteriorating security conditions in the country.

The U.S. State Department said late Tuesday that its embassy staff had been moved out of the Yemeni capital, Sana'a, while Britain announced early Wednesday that its staff had been withdrawn. France will close its embassy on Friday.

"Recent unilateral actions disrupted the political transition process in Yemen, creating the risk that renewed violence would threaten Yemenis and the diplomatic community in Sana’a," State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement. "The United States remains firmly committed to supporting all Yemenis who continue to work toward a peaceful, prosperous, and unified Yemen. We will explore options for a return to Sana’a when the situation on the ground improves."

The U.S., Britain and France all advised citizens not to travel to Yemen, and for those already in the country to leave.

Yemen has been mired in political turmoil for months. Last month, Houthi Shi'ite rebels took over the residence of President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi, prompting him and his Cabinet to resign. The rebels finalized their takeover of the country last Friday, announcing they have dissolved parliament and are establishing a new presidential council to run Yemeni affairs.
