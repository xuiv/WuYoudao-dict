**日本暴雨成灾**

日本中部和东部部分地区星期四再降暴雨，引发洪水，数万人被迫撤离。当局大力抢救没能及时撤出的居民，场面惊险。

受灾最严重的是东京东北约50公里的常总市。当地的鬼怒川河河水暴涨，漫到周围社区。

一些房屋被水冲走。在未被冲垮的房屋里，人们爬到凉台和屋顶寻求帮助。当局派出军用直升机救人，电视镜头显示多个救援的场景，有名男子在洪水中站在一根木头上，紧紧地抱住电线杆，后来获救。

美国之音驻东京记者赫尔曼在东京说，“目前还不知道洪水造成多大伤亡。据报道有两人失踪。但从灾区被破坏的情景来看，许多人会说，如果伤亡人数仅此而已，那真是奇迹。”

台风艾涛本星期给日本带来暴雨。有些地区的降雨量超过50厘米。

日本气象厅广泛发布警告，敦促居民准备对付更多的洪水和滑坡。

日本首相安倍晋三星期四表示集中救助灾情最严重的地区，“优先考虑人民的安全”。

Heavy Rain Pounds Japan

Heavy rains in already drenched areas of central and northern Japan caused major flooding Thursday, forcing tens of thousands of people to evacuate and setting off dramatic rescues of those who could not get out in time.

The worst hit area was the city of Joso, about 50 kilometers northeast of the capital, Tokyo, where the banks of the Kinugawa River could not contain the swell of water that surged out into the surrounding community.

The floodwaters swept away houses, and in the buildings that remained, people climbed to balconies and rooftops seeking help. Television cameras captured the scenes of multiple rescues as military helicopters flew in overhead and pulled multiple people up to safety.

One man stood on a log and clung to a power pole as the water passed all around him. He was later rescued.

"At this point we have no clear idea of the casualties," VOA correspondent Steve Herman said from Tokyo. "Two people are reported missing, but if you see the scenes of devastation, I think a lot of people would say it'll be miraculous if the casualty count is not higher."

Japan has seen extensive rains this week from what was Typhoon Etau, with rainfall totals in some areas exceeding 50 centimeters.

Japan's Meteorological Agency posted widespread warnings, urging people to be ready for more flooding and landslides.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe vowed Thursday to focus on the hardest hit areas and "prioritize the safety of the people."

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang: No 'Hard Landing' for Chinese Economy

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said Thursday that the country's economy is facing "a number of difficulties and downward pressure," but expressed confidence it would not experience what he called a "hard landing."

Speaking at the Workd Economic Forum in Dalian, China, Li cited a slowing worldwide economy as a challenge to China's growth. Still, he said the Chinese economy is "within a reasonable range."

"China's economy is trending well as it slows down in pace toward increasing stability, though not without difficulties, and the general picture shows more opportunities than challenges," Li said.

He also expressed confidence that China will meet its main economic targets this year.

Concerns about a slowdown in China's economy, the second largest in the world, have rippled across global stock markets in the past few months, with China's own Shanghai Composite Index falling 40 percent since June.

Li said Thursday China would keep exchange rates "stable at a reasonable and balanced level."
