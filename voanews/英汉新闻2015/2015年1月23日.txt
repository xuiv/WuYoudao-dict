**乌东冲突死亡人数已逾五千**

联合国人权事务高级专员办事处说，乌克兰东部冲突的死亡人数已超过五千。

办事处发言人鲁帕特•科尔维尔星期五对记者说， 死亡人数可能大大超出官方估计的5086人。这个数字是根据联合国人权监察员去年4月冲突爆发以来统计的数据。

与此同时，俄罗斯总统普京星期五与高层官员会晤时指责乌克兰政府在乌克兰东部造成暴力升级。 当地的亲俄分离分子正与乌克兰政府军争夺地盘。

联合国说，据他们统计，过去九天的战斗造成262人死亡。

另外，乌克兰东部顿涅斯克的反政府武装领导人扎哈琴科表示，他不会推动与乌克兰政府进行新的和谈，而是决心在乌克兰东部攻占更多的领土。

俄罗斯媒体星期五引述扎哈琴科的话说，他的部队正在发动新的攻势，扩大地盘。

星期四，顿涅斯克一辆公交车被炮弹击中，导致至少13人丧生。政府和反叛武装都宣称对方应对此负责。

UN: Death Toll From Ukraine Conflict Passes 5,000

The United Nations human rights agency says the death toll from the conflict in eastern Ukraine has passed 5,000.

Spokesman Rupert Colville told reporters Friday that the death toll could be far higher than the official estimate of 5,086 deaths, based on data collected by U.N. human rights monitors since the beginning of hostilities in April.

Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has accused the Ukrainian government of starting a surge in violence in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian separatists are battling Ukrainian troops to gain territory. Mr. Putin made the claim Friday in a meeting with senior officials.

The United Nations says it has counted 262 deaths in the fighting in the past nine days.

Earlier Friday, a pro-Russian separatist leader said he will not push for new peace talks with the Ukrainian government, vowing instead to gain control of more territory in the east.

Russian news agencies quoted rebel chief Alexander Zakharchenko, based in the eastern city of Donetsk, as saying that his forces are launching a new offensive to expand their territory.

On Thursday in Donetsk, at least 13 people were killed when a trolley bus was hit in an apparent mortar attack, sparking accusations of blame from both sides.
