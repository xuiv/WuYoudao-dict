**欧盟外长商讨反恐问题**

应对法国发生的致命袭击以及比利时发动的反恐突袭行动，欧盟星期一在布鲁塞尔举行外长会议。

欧盟外长们将商讨一系列选择方案。欧盟准备下月举行一次特别峰会，专门讨论反恐问题。

比利时司法部长吉恩斯表示，上星期恐怖袭击的涉嫌策划者仍然在逃。这让大部分欧洲地区星期天高度戒备，气氛紧张。

据信嫌疑人已经逃到希腊，但吉恩斯说，嫌疑人并不包括在希腊被捕的4人当中。不过比利时检察官仍计划要求希腊把他们逮捕的4人中的一人引渡到比利时。此人因为与一起未遂恐怖袭击有关而被逮捕。

比利时媒体披露，被追捕的恐怖袭击策划人叫阿卜杜勒哈米德.阿布德，今年27岁，是一名摩洛哥后裔的比利时公民。他被怀疑领导一个在东部城市韦尔维耶的伊斯兰极端小组。当局说，这个小组准备对警方目标发动重大的恐怖袭击，但当局星期四捣毁了他们的窝点，并在激烈的枪战中打死两人。

与此同时，欧洲仍未摆脱月初《查理周刊》社恐怖袭击造成的惊愕。12人在那场袭击中被打死。一名女警和一家犹太超市的4名顾客在随后发生的袭击中丧生。

法国政府表示，被警察击毙的袭击查理周刊的两兄弟被埋葬在法国没有标记的墓穴中。

Terrorism Threat to Dominate EU Talks

European Union foreign ministers meet in Brussels Monday in the aftermath of deadly attacks in France and anti-terror raids in Belgium.

The ministers will discuss a range of options as the bloc prepares for a special summit next month dedicated to fighting terrorism.

Much of Europe remains tense and on high alert as Belgium's justice minister says the alleged mastermind in last week's foiled terror attack remains at large.

Koen Geens says the suspect was not among four people arrested in Greece where he was believed to have fled. But Belgian prosecutors still plan to ask Greece to extradite one of those arrested in connection with the thwarted terror strike.

Belgian media have named the wanted mastermind of the plot as Abdelhamid Abaaoud. The 27-year-old Belgian of Moroccan descent is suspected of leading an Islamic extremist cell in the eastern town of Verviers. Authorities say the cell was about to launch a major terrorist attack on police targets before officers raided their hideout Thursday, killing two in a fierce gunbattle.

Meanwhile, Europe is still reeling from terror attacks in Paris earlier this month that killed 12 people at the Charlie Hebdo magazine, a police officer, and four people in a Jewish supermarket.

French authorities say the two brothers in the Charlie Hebdo massacre who were killed by police have been buried in secret, unmarked graves in France.


**乐施会：贫富不均现象日益严重**

国际发展与救援组织乐施会说，世界上1%最富有的人明年将拥有全球大部分财富。

2014年，最富有的这部分人拥有全球48%的财富，2009年的比例是44%，2016年则将超过50%。

这份报告于星期一发表，世界经济论坛年度会议本周将在瑞士城市达沃斯召开。

乐施会警告说，不平等的急剧增长阻碍了消除全球贫穷现象的努力。目前世界上每9个人里就有一个人吃不饱，10亿多人每天的生活费不到1.25美元。

为了遏制极端的不平等现象，乐施会敦促各国打击逃税行为、改善公共服务、对资本而不是对劳动课税以及规定最低工资标准。

Oxfam: Richest 1% to Own Half the World's Wealth by 2016

The richest 1 percent of people in the world will have a majority of the wealth on the planet next year, according to development nonprofit Oxfam.

The most-affluent’s share of global wealth climbed to 48 percent in 2014, compared with 44 percent in 2009, and will likely pass 50 percent in 2016.

The report was released Monday ahead of the annual World Economic Forum meeting this week in Davos, Switzerland.

Oxfam warned that the '"explosion in inequality"' is holding back the fight against global poverty at a time when one in nine people do not have enough to eat and more than a billion people still live on less than $1.25 a day.

In order to curb extreme inequality, Oxfam is calling upon states to tackle tax evasion, improve public services, tax capital rather than labor, and introduce living minimum wages, among other measures.
