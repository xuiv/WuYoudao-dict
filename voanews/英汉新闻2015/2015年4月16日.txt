**普京为恢复向伊朗出售导弹辩解**

俄罗斯总统普京星期四说，伊朗愿意努力就其核计划达成协议，为他决定向伊朗出售S-300 防空系统铺平了道路。

普京星期四在俄罗斯电视台进行每年一次的问答，回答俄罗斯民众的问题。

莫斯科2007年与伊朗签署了8亿美元的合同，向伊朗提供S-300防空系统，但是俄罗斯三年后在安理会决定制裁伊朗后冻结了合同。

星期一，美国政府在俄罗斯宣布解除对伊朗禁运几个小时之后对俄罗斯的做法表示关注。

美国务院说，向伊朗交付导弹不违反现有的安理会制裁，但是美国认为，那个地区局势动荡，现在向伊朗出售武器不合时宜。

Putin: Iran's "Flexibility" Behind Decision to Lift S-300 Ban

Russian President Vladimir Putin says Iran's willingness to try to reach a settlement over its nuclear program was behind his decision to clear the way for the possible sale of an S-300 air defense system to Tehran.

Mr. Putin spoke Thursday in an annual live question-and-answer session on Russian television, taking questions from members of the Russian public.

Moscow signed a contract worth $800 million back in 2007 to supply Tehran with five S-300 batteries. But Russia froze the contract three years later after the United Nations Security Council imposed sanctions on Iran.

On Monday, hours after Moscow announced the decision to lift the ban, the U.S. Obama administration expressed concern over the development.

The U.S. State Department said transfer of S-300 missiles to Iran would not violate existing U.N. Security Council sanctions, but the U.S. believes "this is not the time" for the sale, given the unrest in the region.


**七国集团吁俄履行明斯克协议**

世界七个主要工业国家（七国集团）的外交部长呼吁俄罗斯遏制乌克兰反叛分子，遵守在明斯克达成的旨在结束冲突的两项和平协议。七国集团外长在德国吕贝克开会后发表的联合公报中作出上述呼吁。

七国集团外长会议主持人、德国外长施泰因迈尔说，七国外长呼吁遵守乌克兰停火协议，结束最近升级的暴力冲突。

他还表示对俄罗斯决定向伊朗出售导弹系统的担忧。施泰因迈尔说：“在接下来的两个半月里，我们有机会达成一项合适的协议，取得不错的结果。因此，我认为不应该在解决问题之前采取可能引起任何一方误解的行动。”

德国、英国、法国、意大利、日本、加拿大和美国的外交部长在会上讨论了乌克兰、伊拉克、叙利亚、也门、利比亚和非洲等国的危机。多数七国集团成员也参加了以美国国务卿克里为主导的伊核谈判。

克里国务卿说：“我们相信，总统有能力通过谈判达成协议，让世界更加安全。” 他说，他努力促成两个星期前达成伊核框架协议，现在距离达成最终协议的最后期限还有两个半月的时间，伊核谈判显得更加重要。

七国集团外长会谈期间，吕贝克戒备森严。有人在当地举行示威，抗议七国集团的政策。不过，吕贝克没有再现一个月前在法兰克福示威中出现的暴力。

德国外长施泰因迈尔表示，尽管会谈的重要性被“低估”了，但会谈相当严肃认真，因为各国部长有机会讨论影响成百上千万人的危机；而且，七国集团成员作为世界最富裕的和拥有庞大军力的国家，可以为解决危机发挥重要作用。

G-7 Calls on Russia to Implement Minsk Accords

Foreign ministers from the world’s seven leading industrialized countries have called on Russia to rein in Ukrainian rebels and abide by two peace accords reached in Minsk designed to end the conflict. The call came in a communiqué at the end of a meeting in Luebeck, Germany.

Their host, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said they called for an end to the recent increase in violence in Ukraine, in spite of a ceasefire.

He also expressed concern about Russia’s decision to sell missiles to Iran, indicating the move is poorly timed with the negotiations on Iran’s nuclear program. “We have the opportunity within the next two-and-a-half months to reach a proper agreement, to get a proper result. So, I don’t think that we should preempt this issue and take steps that might be misunderstood by one side or another.”

This meeting brought together the foreign ministers of Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Japan, Canada and the United States for meetings on crises including Ukraine, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Libya and several in Africa.

Most of the G7 countries are also involved in the talks on Iran’s nuclear program, in which U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has been taking a leading role.

Secretary of State John Kerry said: “We are confident about our ability for the president to negotiate an agreement and to do so with the ability to make the world safer.”

Secretary Kerry said the Iran talks are “looming large” after he helped reach a framework accord two weeks ago, and with the deadline for a final agreement just two-and-a-half months away.

There was a heavy police presence in Luebeck for this meeting, as protesters gathered to march against G7 policies. But the violence that erupted during similar demonstrations a month ago in Frankfurt was not repeated.

These meetings involve considerable formality. But Minister Steinmeier said their importance is “underestimated,” though, as ministers have the chance to discuss crises that affect millions of people, and in which the world’s richest countries, and some of its largest militaries, have an important role to play.
