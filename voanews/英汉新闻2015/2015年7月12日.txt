**欧元区19国财长继续开会**

欧盟取消了有关希腊救助问题的28国峰会，星期天出席会议的将只有欧元区各国领导人。

欧元区19国财政部长星期日继续在布鲁塞尔开会，之前星期六八个小时的会谈未能取得突破。

欧洲理事会主席图斯克说，19国财政部长将继续开会，直到有关希腊问题的会谈结束为止。

欧元区官员讨论了希腊七月早些时候未能按期还债的问题。他们还寻求希腊就遵守可能达成的任何新协议做出新的保证。欧元区高级官员星期六说，他们讨论了信誉和信任的问题。

有消息说，欧元区各国财政部长利用星期六的会议讨论如何要求希腊进一步紧缩开支、实施政治改革的措施，然后才会就新一轮贷款进行谈判。

EU Talks on Greece Continue

The European Union has canceled a full 28-nation summit on Greece's bailout hopes Sunday, and will instead limit the talks to leaders of the eurozone nations.

The 19 eurozone finance ministers are continuing to meet in Brussels, after eight hours of talks Saturday failed to produce a breakthrough.

The ministers' meeting will "last until we conclude talks on Greece," said European Council President Donald Tusk.

Eurozone officials are grappling with Greece's failure to meet a repayment deadline on a loan installment earlier this month. They are also seeking additional assurances that Athens will honor terms of any new deal.

Sources say the finance ministers used their Saturday meeting to formulate demands for additional Greek budget and political reforms before they open negotiations on any new loans.

**伊核谈判最后期限即将到来**


随着最后一轮伊朗核谈判最后期限的倒计时钟声即将敲响，美国和伊朗高级外交官员星期天晚间在维也纳开始了又一次会晤，可能在努力推动星期一宣布达

成一项最终的核协议。

美国国务院一名高级官员警告说，谈判中仍然需要解决一些“重大议题”，伊朗外交官员阿里雷札称星期天宣布的一份100页的协定“从逻辑上根本不可能”。

美联社首先报道说，达成协议的声明将在星期一宣布。

其它意见不一的方面包括，各方对是否解除联合国对伊朗武器禁运的问题意见分歧。西方大国希望继续保持禁运。

参加核谈判的欧盟外交政策主管莫盖里尼星期天早晨表示，谈判代表正处于“决定性的时刻”。

现在六大国当中除了中国外长之外，都已经会聚维也纳。目前还不清楚中国外长王毅是否会再次亲自参加谈判。

Deadline Looms for Iran Talks

With the countdown clock winding down in the latest round of talks over Iran’s nuclear program, the top U.S. and Iranian diplomats began another meeting in Vienna Sunday evening, possibly pushing the announcement of a final deal to Monday.

A senior U.S. State Department official warned that "major issues" remain to be resolved in the talks, and Iranian foreign affairs official Alireza Miryousefi called a Sunday announcement of the 100-page accord “simply logistically impossible”.

The Associated Press first reported that the announcement would be made Monday.

Among other disagreements, the sides are split over a U.N. arms embargo on Iran, which Western powers want to keep in place.

EU Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini, who is also part of the talks, said Sunday morning negotiators were in the "decisive hours."

The foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany were also in Vienna. It remains unclear when China’s Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, will rejoin negotiations in person.
