**克里: 跨太平洋合作伙伴协议谈判有进展**

美国国务卿克里星期二说，12个国家在跨太平洋合作伙伴协议谈判中朝着达成最终协议取得了“良好的进展”，但仍有一些细节有待解决。

克里在访问新加坡期间发表演讲，强调指出这项协议的一系列目标。他表示，该协议不仅能为签署国创造经济机会，而且还能显示对“善治、透明及问责”的支持。

有关谈判已经持续了数年，各国贸易部长上星期未能在夏威夷的谈判中达成最终协议。如能最终达成协议，跨太平洋合作伙伴协议将涵盖全球经济的40%。

克里说，跨太平洋合作伙伴协议将提高标准，规定必须遵守国际劳工和环保标准，国有企业必须公平地同私有企业竞争，并规定企业不得雇用未成年人或使用不安全的工作场所。

Kerry Cites Progress Toward Pacific Trade Deal

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Tuesday the 12 nations negotiating the massive Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal have made "good progress" toward reaching a final agreement, but that some details remain to be worked out.

He highlighted a series of goals for the pact as he spoke during a visit to Singapore, saying the deal would not only create economic opportunities for the countries involved, but also serve as a show of support for "good governance, transparency and accountability."

Negotiations have stretched on for years, and last week trade ministers failed to agree on a final pact during talks in Hawaii. If completed, the so-called TPP could cover 40 percent of the global economy.

Kerry said the TPP would raise standards by calling for compliance with international labor and environmental standards, for state-owned companies to compete fairly with the private sector, and for businesses to refrain from the use of underage workers or unsafe work places.


**东耶路撒冷巴人寻求以色列国籍者增多**

居住在东耶路撒冷的大多数巴勒斯坦人长期以来拒绝选择以色列国籍，视之为背叛他们的政治大业 - 建立一个以东耶路撒冷为首都的巴勒斯坦国。但由于这个梦想仍然遥遥无期，越来越多的巴勒斯坦人正在申请获得以色列公民身份。很多巴勒斯坦人表示，这是个艰难决定，但不得不务实面对。

申请以色列国籍的巴勒斯坦人通常会说他们没有选择。

一位要求匿名的巴勒斯坦教师说：“我有一种不好的感受，因为我希望有我的国家护照。作为一个耶路撒冷人，作为一个巴勒斯坦人，我应该有一本巴勒斯坦护照。但不幸的是，我得不到。相反，我得到的东西只会把我跟耶路撒冷连接得更紧。”

虽然一些巴勒斯坦人说，以色列公民身份能使他们得到更好的工作和更多优惠，但也有人不这样认为。

东耶路撒冷居民加桑·诺法尔说：“对于有孩子、有钱花、有房子和商店的这些人来说，公民身份根本帮不上忙。如果他们发一本护照，但是收走身份证，对我来说是一样的。”

这并非都与福利待遇相关。十多年前在一系列自杀式炸弹袭击之后以色列建的一堵混凝土墙，把耶路撒冷郊区一些巴勒斯坦人的住房与这座城市的其余部分隔开了。这些巴勒斯坦人担心他们可能会失去耶路撒冷的居住权。

路透社获得的内政部数字显示，2012-2013年共有1434份护照申请，其中189份已获批准，其余的大部分仍在处理中。

以色列学者拉蒙说：“我们确实看到，拥有以色列国永久居留权的东耶路撒冷人寻求以色列公民身份的人数有所增加。增加幅度有多大的问题可以探讨。”

推动建立一个包括东耶路撒冷的国家的巴勒斯坦官员感到关切。

前巴勒斯坦谈判人员塔法基说：“有很大的风险，如果情况持续下去，巴勒斯坦人还谈判什么呢？他们要谈判土地 - 他们已经失去了土地。他们要谈判人口，而人口正在流失。”

他们说，考虑到那些成为以色列公民的人的孩子生来就是以色列公民，人口方面的影响可能更大。耶路撒冷官员否认人口问题将影响以色列与巴勒斯坦人的谈判。

Growing Number of Eastern Jerusalem Palestinians Seek Israeli Citizenship

Most Palestinians living in East Jerusalem have long rejected the option of full Israeli citizenship, seeing it as a betrayal to their political cause - the formation of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. But as that dream remains elusive, more and more Palestinians are applying for Israeli citizenship.

Palestinians seeking Israeli citizenship usually say they do not have a choice.

Palestinian Teacher, who asked not to be identified, said: "I have a bad feeling because I prefer to have the passport of my country as a Jerusalemite, as a Palestinian, so I should have a Palestinian passport. But unfortunately I cannot get one. Instead, I got something that will only connect me more to Jerusalem."

While some Palestinians say that full-fledged citizenship enables them to get better jobs and more benefits, others disagree.

Ghassan Nofal, East Jerusalem resident said: "For someone that has children, expenses, a house and a shop and all these things, the citizenship could never help. If they give us a passport and take away our IDs, it is the same for me."

It is not all about benefits. The suburban Jerusalem homes of some Palestinians got separated from the rest of the city by an Israeli concrete wall built ten years ago after a rash of suicide bombings. Those Palestinians fear they may lose Jerusalem residency.

Interior Ministry figures obtained by the Reuters news agency, show that there were 1,434 passport applications for the year 2012-2013, of which 189 have been approved. Most of the rest are still being processed.

Amnon Ramon, Researcher Of The Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies, said: "We are indeed witnessing an increase in the number of East Jerusalemites who have permanent residency status in the state of Israel who are seeking Israeli citizenship. The question of how big this increase is - is debatable."

Palestinian officials pushing for a state that would include the territory of East Jerusalem are concerned.

Khalil Tafakji, former member of The Palestinian Negotiating Team, said: "There is a big risk that if the situation continues, what will the Palestinians negotiate about? They want to negotiate about land - they already lost the land. They want to negotiate for the population and the population is being lost."

The demographic impact could be even wider, they say, when one considers that the children of those who become Israeli are born Israeli citizens. Officials in Jerusalem deny that the demographics will affect Israel's negotiations with Palestinians.
