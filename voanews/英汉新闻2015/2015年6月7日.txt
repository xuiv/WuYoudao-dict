Obama in Germany for G7 Summit

U.S. President Barack Obama is in Germany for the two-day summit of the Group of 7, the world's seven leading industrialized nations.

He appeared outdoors Sunday with German Chancellor Angel Merkel under sunny skies at a picturesque Bavarian village resort where Germans, many of them wearing traditional German folk garb, listened to remarks from both leaders.

Mr. Obama said he was looking forward to discussing with his German counterpart the "shared future" of the U.S. and Germany, including "standing up to Russian aggression in Ukraine."

Chancellor Merkel called the U.S. "our friend and our partner."

Trade is the official agenda of the gathering, but the world leaders are facing a number of challenges that will also likely come up for discussion.


**土耳其星期天举行议会选举**

土耳其星期天举行议会选举，投票结果将决定埃尔多安总统是否连任以及是否有可能改革宪法，扩大总统的权力。

星期天的议会选举被认为是多年来最紧张的一次。尽管埃尔多安的正义与发展党人气低迷，但一些选民和民意调查认为该党不会失去权力。

民调人员塔尔汗·埃德姆说，最近的暴力和违法行为，特别是埃尔多安的一些被视为违法的行为引起了公众反应，所以执政党支持率下降，但是人们并不认为反对党具备领导能力。

代表土耳其库尔德少数民族的人民民主党的投票是此次选举的关键。他们的投票将决定埃尔多安的政党能否获得议会550个席位的三分之二绝对多数。

如果得到这样的超级多数，预计正义与发展党将寻求修改宪法，给总统更多权力。

一位土耳其选民说，希望大家星期一醒来的时候对选举结果感到高兴和满意。

最近的民调结果显示，正义与发展党这次的得票率可能大大低于2011年的近50%的得票率。该党甚至可能不得不组成联合政府。

Turkey Elections

Voters in Turkey are deciding Sunday whether President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will get another term, and possibly reform the constitution in a manner that might give him more power.

Sunday's vote is considered one country's tightest parliamentary elections in years. Despite a slump in the popularity of Mr. Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party, some voters and a pollster believe the party will not lose its power.

"Lately violence and breach of law, especially by Erdogan, caused a public reaction. I think that's the reason of the decrease and I think it could have been even lower but my guess is that people didn't think the opposition party was ready to take the lead."

Voters from the Peoples' Democratic Party, which represents Turkey's Kurdish minority, will be crucial in determining whether Mr. Erdogan’s AKP party gets the super-majority it seeks of the 550 seats in parliament.

If successful, the AKP is expected to seek changes to the constitution to give the president more power.

"When we wake up Monday morning, I hope everyone will be happy and satisfied with the results of the election."

Polls have indicated the AKP vote could be well below the almost 50 percent tally it reaped in the last elections in 2011. It may even need to form a coalition.
