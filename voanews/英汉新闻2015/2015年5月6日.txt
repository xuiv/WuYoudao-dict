**克里将会见吉布提政府官员**

美国国务卿克里星期三将在非洲之角国家吉布提举行会谈。这是他此次出访的最后一站，此前他于星期二访问了索马里。

预计克里将会见吉布提总统盖莱和外交部长优素福，随后将在美国军事基地勒莫尼尔营与美国官员会面。由于吉布提与也门和沙特阿拉伯隔亚丁湾相望，美国在吉布提的军事设施已成为美国在中东军事存在的重要组成部分。

克里星期二对索马里进行了具有历史意义的访问。这是美国国务卿首次访问这个饱受战火蹂躏的国家。

随同克里访问的美国之音记者多金斯报道说，克里在摩加迪沙机场停留了大约三个半小时，在那里会晤了索马里总统马哈茂德、总理和其他官员。

索马里外长奥马尔对美国之音说，克里此次显示索马里的局势已经趋于正常。

奥马尔说，与克里的讨论重点是加强索马里政府以及准备在索马里首都重开美国大使馆。

U.S. Secretary of State Meets with Government Officials in Djibouti

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is scheduled to hold meetings in the Horn of Africa nation of Djibouti Wednesday, the latest stop on his foreign tour that included a stop in Somalia on Tuesday.

Kerry is expected to meet with President Ismail Omar Guelleh and Foreign Minister Mahamoud Ali Youssouf, and also later with U.S. officials at the U.S. military base Camp Lemmonier. The U.S. military installment in Djibouti has become an important part of the U.S. military presence in the Middle East, as it lies just across the Gulf of Aden from Yemen and Saudi Arabia.

On Tuesday, Kerry made a historic visit to Somalia, becoming the first top-ranking U.S. diplomat to visit the war-torn country.

VOA's Pam Dockins, who is traveling with Kerry, reports the secretary spent about three-and-a-half hours at the Mogadishu airport, where he met with President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, the prime minister and other officials.

Somali Foreign Minister Abdisalam Hadliye Omer told VOA's Somali service that the visit shows Somalia has turned around and is "open for business."

He said talks with Kerry focused on giving Somalia a stronger government and prospects for reopening a U.S. embassy in the capital.

奥巴马政府恢复美国与前冷战劲敌古巴之间的商业轮渡运作，向美古两国关系正常化又迈进了一步。

此外，美国捷蓝航空公司星期二宣布，该公司将从7月开始在纽约市和哈瓦那之间提供包机服务。

1959年古巴共产党革命爆发之前，美国和古巴之间的轮渡一直正常运作。

US Approves Sea Ferry Service To and From Cuba

The Obama administration has taken another step forward in its efforts to normalize relations with Cuba by restoring commercial ferry services between the former Cold War rivals.

The U.S. Treasury Department has issued licenses to at least four companies to ferry passengers and cargo along the 150 kilometer route from the southern tip of Florida to Havana. Three of the companies are based in Florida.

In a related story, U.S.-based airliner Jet Blue announced Tuesday it would provide charter flights between New York City and Havana beginning in July.

Ferry service between the U.S. and Cuba was commonplace in the years before the 1959 communist revolution.
