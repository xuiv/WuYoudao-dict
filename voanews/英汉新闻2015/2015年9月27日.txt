France Launches Air Strikes in Syria

France says it has launched its first air strikes against the Islamic State militants in Syria.

A statement from the office of French President Francois Hollande said the strikes were conducted early Sunday and were coordinated with France's regional partners.

Earlier this month, France had begun reconnaissance flights over Syria. President Hollande's statement said information about the targets of Sunday's strikes was gathered from that surveillance.

"Our country thus confirms its resolute commitment to fight against the terrorist threat" represented by the Islamic State, the statement said. "We will strike each time that our national security is at stake."

Until Sunday, France had only taken part in air strikes against the jihadists in neighboring Iraq.


**巴勒斯坦人和以色列警察在阿克萨清真寺爆发冲突**

以色列防暴警察星期天早晨在耶路撒冷的冲突热点地区阿克萨清真寺所在地和巴勒斯坦抗议者发生了短暂冲突。使得那里的局势在犹太人主要节日到来前变得紧张。

警方表示，带着面罩的年轻巴勒斯坦人向以色列警察和边防警察投掷石块和爆竹，以色列警方则对抗议者采取了防暴驱离措施。

在耶路撒冷老城这处清真寺的山顶所在地发生这起争执冲突之后，没有受伤或者逮捕的报道。这处地点被犹太人和穆斯林都视为敬仰的圣地。

这起发生在穆斯林古尔邦节最后一天的冲突之后，抗议者准备在犹太人历时八天的住棚节期间，保卫这座清真寺。他们在清真寺内囤积石块，并计划睡在清真寺里。

日落时开始的住棚节，预计将使得阿克萨清真寺所在地的犹太人访客增加，犹太人称那里是圣殿山。那里是穆斯林心目中仅次于沙特麦加和麦地那之后的第三圣地。

按照目前的规定，犹太人可以造访这处圣地，但是出于担心会与穆斯林敬拜者发生摩擦，犹太人不能在那里祷告。

Palestinians, Israeli Police Clash at Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque

Israeli riot police briefly clashed with Palestinian protesters at Jerusalem's flashpoint Al-Aqsa mosque compound early Sunday, raising tensions ahead of a major Jewish holiday.

Young masked Palestinians "threw stones and fireworks at police and border police forces," who responded with "riot dispersal means," police said.

No injuries or arrests were reported following the altercations at the hilltop compound in Jerusalem's Old City that is revered by Jews and Muslims.

After the clashes on what was the last day of the Muslim Eid al-Adha holiday, Palestinian protesters prepared "to defend" the mosque during the eight-day Jewish Sukkot festival, stocking stones inside the shrine and planning to sleep in it.

Sukkot, which started at sunset, is expected to lead to an increase in Jewish visitors to the Al-Aqsa compound, known to Jews as the Temple Mount. Muslims call it the Noble Sanctuary and revere it as their third holiest site, after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia.

Under current rules, Jews can visit the site, but not pray there for fear it would create friction with Muslim worshippers.
