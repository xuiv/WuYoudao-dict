**奥巴马在联大强调外交解决国际纷争**

美国总统奥巴马周一将在联合国大会上发言，届时他将阐述外交和集体行动，凸显美国主导的在中东的努力。

白宫官员表示，奥巴马将指出安理会五个常任理事国加德国与伊朗之间最近达成的核协议。协议表明"在一些国家破坏国际规则而被追究责任时通过国际合作所能发挥的作用，同时也表明如何坚守有原则的外交来实现我们目标。"

奥巴马总统也将谈及叙利亚冲突，呼吁在这个饱受战争蹂躏的国家对伊斯兰国武装组织采取军事行动的同时，需要“所有国家承诺寻求并支持一个政治解决办法”。

奥巴马政府官员曾一再表示，只要叙利亚总统阿萨德依然掌权，这种政治过渡就不可能发生。 这个问题预计将成为奥巴马周一晚些时候与俄罗斯总统普京会谈的焦点。

Obama to Make Case for Diplomacy in UN Address

President Barack Obama will make the case for diplomacy and collective action highlighting U.S. - led efforts in the Middle East when he addresses the United Nations General Assembly on Monday.

A White House official said Obama will point to the recently completed nuclear deal between the P5+1 and Iran as an example of "what can be accomplished by international cooperation when nations are held accountable for violating international rules, and principled diplomacy is pursued to achieve our objectives."

The U.S. president also will address the conflict in Syria, calling for the need to couple military efforts against the Islamic State militant group "with a commitment by all nations to seek and support a political resolution" in the war-torn country.

Obama administration officials have repeatedly said that such a political transition cannot occur as long as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad remains in power. That issue is expected to be a focus of Obama's talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin later on Monday.

Rouhani Cutting UN Trip Short to Honor Hajj Stampede Victims

Iran's President Hassan Rouhani will depart New York for Tehran on Monday, cutting short his visit for the U.N. General Assembly meetings so that he can take part in a ceremony for the Iranians killed in a stampede during the annual Hajj pilgrimage.

Some 169 Iranians have been confirmed dead among the 769 killed last week outside the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia. More than 300 Iranians remain missing.

Rouhani is scheduled to give a speech before the General Assembly on Monday morning. Iran's mission to the U.N. says Rouhani has canceled some of his sideline meetings at the event in order to depart for home in the afternoon.

On Sunday, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei demanded Saudi Arabia apologize for the stampede.

Iranians protested Sunday outside the Saudi embassy in Tehran for a third straight day.

Saudi Foreign Minister Adel bin Ahmed Al-Jubeir accused Iran of politically exploiting the tragedy.
