Japan US War Apology

Executives from Japan's Mitsubishi Corporation offered a historic personal apology for the company's use of American prisoners of war as forced laborers during World War Two.

Mitsubishi executive Hikaru Kimura offered a "most remorseful apology" to 94-year-old former prisoner of war James Murphy during a public ceremony Sunday in Los Angeles.

"I listened very carefully to Mr. Kimura's statement of apology, and found it very, very sincere, humble, and revealing. And this happened to be the first time that we've heard those words and they really touch you at the heart of the thing."

Twelve-thousand American prisoners of war were put into forced labor by the Japanese government and private companies

Although the Japanese government has officially apologized for using American POWs as forced laborers, the apology by Mitsubishi is the first ever by a Japanese conglomerate.

**希腊银行恢复营业**

缺乏现金的希腊各银行在关闭三周后，于星期一恢复营业。银行的客户们可以每星期一次性提款455美元，而不再是每天限制提款65美元。不过，对现金转账国外的限制仍未取消。

德国总理默克尔再次拒绝接受有关部分取消希腊债务的方案，但表示德国政府在就希腊如何偿还救助贷款的新谈判中将采取灵活立场。

默克尔星期日在德国发表电视讲话，排除了迫使希腊脱离欧元区的可能性。默克尔上星期五对希腊议员们说，希腊短期脱离欧元区必将引发混乱。

Banks Finally Open in Greece

Banks in cash-strapped Greece opened Monday for the first time in three weeks. Bank customers will be allowed to make a single withdrawal of $455 a week, instead of just $65 in daily withdrawals. However, restrictions on cash transfers abroad will remain in place.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has again rejected proposals to write off part of Greece's debt, but says her government will show flexibility in new talks about how Athens structures its bailout repayments.

Speaking Sunday on German television, the chancellor also ruled out forcing Greece to leave the 19-nation eurozone. She told German lawmakers Friday that a temporary Greek exit would lead to "predictable chaos."
