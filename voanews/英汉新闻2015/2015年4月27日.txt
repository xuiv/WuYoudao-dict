**克里周一与伊朗外长举行会谈**

美国国务卿克里和伊朗外长扎里夫星期一将在纽约举行会谈。自宣布有关伊朗限制其核项目以换取国际社会放松制裁的框架协议以来，这是克里与扎里夫的首次会谈。

美国国务院一名高层官员星期日说，此次会谈将在联合国核不扩散条约会议期间举行。

伊朗和世界六强国的谈判代表将6月30日设为达成最终协议的最后期限。该协议旨在解决伊朗的核项目问题，人们担心伊朗利用这一项目研制核武器。

包括以色列总理内塔尼亚胡在内的批评人士说，美国以及英国、中国、法国、俄罗斯和德国对伊朗过于软弱，在取消制裁的同时允许伊朗继续从事太多的核活动。

美国总统奥巴马为框架协议的条款进行辩护，他强调说，如果伊朗不履行协议，就可以重新实施制裁。

在星期六举行的共和党犹太人联盟会议上，难得露面的前总统老布什对框架协议提出批评，并质疑重新对伊朗实施制裁的可行性。

Kerry, Zarif to Meet as Iran Nuclear Talks Continue Toward June Deadline

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif will meet Monday in New York for the first time since announcing a framework deal to curtail Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.

A senior State Department official said Sunday the meeting will take place on the sidelines of the U.N.'s conference on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

Negotiators from Iran and a group of six world powers have given themselves until June 30 to agree on a final deal addressing Iran's nuclear program and concerns that it could be used to develop nuclear weapons.

Critics of the talks, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, say the U.S. and its partners Britain, China, France, Russia and Germany are being too soft on Iran and would allow too much nuclear activity to continue while taking away the sanctions.

U.S. President Barack Obama has defended the provisions of the framework deal, emphasizing that sanctions could be reimposed if Iran failed to uphold its part of the agreement.

In a rare appearance Saturday at a meeting of the Republican Jewish Coalition, former President George W. Bush expressed his criticism, questioning the feasibility of putting the sanctions back into place.
