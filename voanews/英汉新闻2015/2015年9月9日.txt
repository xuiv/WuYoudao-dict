**缅甸总统会见反政府组织谈判代表**

缅甸总统吴登盛星期三在行政首都内比都会见少数民族反政府武装的谈判代表，敦促他们在11月大选前签署全国范围的停火协议。

这是吴登盛自大选竞选活动正式开始以来首次公开露面。

缅甸十几个反政府组织已经与政府谈判了近两年，吴登盛星期三会见了其中五个组织的代表。他说，缅甸要实现进一步的民主改革，就必须在全国范围内实现停火。

缅甸政府和反政府武装在应由谁来签署停火协议的问题上有分歧。许多反政府人士认为应当包括一些不被政府承认、目前仍在与政府军作战的组织。

对吴登盛来说，谈判达成协议将是一个重大的政治胜利。他虽然没有参加竞选，但仍可能被议会选为总统。

反对派领袖昂山素季这个月呼吁反政府武装领导人不要达成一个草率的协议。她说，最重要的是确保未来的稳定。

Myanmar President Urges Progress on Rebel Cease-Fire

Myanmar President Thein Sein has met with ethnic rebel negotiators, urging them to sign a nationwide cease-fire deal before the country's November general election.

Wednesday's meeting in the administrative capital, Naypyidaw, is the first public appearance by the president since the official start of campaigning for the November 8 polls.

The ex-army general met with representatives of five of the more than a dozen rebel groups that have been participating in the negotiations for nearly two years.

He said a nationwide cease-fire deal is mandatory if the country wants to see further democratic reforms.

Reaching a conclusion in the talks would represent a significant political victory for Thein Sein. He is not running in the election but still could be selected as president by lawmakers.

Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi this month called on rebel leaders not to rush into a hasty deal, saying the most important issue was to ensure future stability.

**肯塔基州抗发同性恋结婚证县文书出狱**

肯塔基州一个县政府的文书金·戴维斯出狱。早些时候，她受到羁押，因为她拒绝向同性恋者发放结婚证书，裁定蔑视法庭。

两个月前，美国最高法院做出历史性裁决，将同性恋婚姻合法化，但戴维斯仍拒绝向同性恋者发放结婚证书。戴维斯的做法在观点对立的人当中引发强烈的反应。

金·戴维斯星期二走出肯塔基州格雷森拘留中心。一位联邦法院法官作出裁决，由于她的６个副手当中的５个“已经宣誓将服从法庭命令，向所有合法寻求婚姻的人发放结婚证书”，因此可以将她释放。

法官命令戴维思不得干扰同性恋者婚姻证书的发放。

戴维斯含眼站在共和党总统竞选人哈克比、她的律师斯塔弗、和她的丈夫乔身边，向欢呼的人群致意。她说：“谢谢大家。我爱各位。我只是想把荣耀归于神。神的子民聚集在一起，你们是坚强的人。”

戴维斯是基督教使徒教会的信徒。她认为批准同性恋婚姻违反她的宗教信仰。

律师斯塔弗说，戴维斯只是坚持她的信仰，不应当为此入狱。他说：“大家知道，金·戴维斯只是坚持信仰，坚持法律。在肯塔基州，假如你发放没有法律依据的证书，就是违法犯罪。而肯塔基州议会并没有修改相关法律条文。”

前阿肯色州州长、浸礼派基督教牧师哈克比谴责最高法院今年6月作出的将同性婚姻合法化的决定。最高法院以5比4做出了上述裁决。

哈克比说：“我们不希望看到这个国家由原来的一个伟大的共和国变成一个纷争四起的弱国。原先我们这里是民治，现在却变成了一个5名非民选法官自以为他们可以统治的地方。”

戴维斯在被拘留期间，她所在的县政府副文书向若干对同性恋者发放了结婚证书。

Kentucky Clerk Who Fought Gay Marriage Released from Jail

Kentucky county clerk has been released from jail after being detained for contempt over her refusal to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.

Kim Davis' decision not to issue the licenses, which came about two months after the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark ruling legalizing gay marriage across the country, has inflamed passions on both sides of the debate.

Kim Davis walked out of a detention center in Grayson, Kentucky Tuesday, six days after being jailed for refusing to issue marriage licenses to gay couples.

A federal judge ruled she could be released because five of her six deputy clerks "stated under oath they would comply with the Court's order and issue marriage certificates to all legally eligible couples."

The judge ordered Davis not to interfere with the granting of same-sex marriage licenses.

Davis, fighting back tears, addressed a cheering crowd while standing next to Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, her lawyer Mat Staver and her husband, Joe.

"Thank you all so much. I love you all so very much. I just want to give God the glory. His people have rallied, and you are a strong people."

Davis, an apostolic Christian, argued that authorizing gay marriages would violate her religious beliefs.

Staver said she was simply upholding her faith and should not have spent time in prison. "You know, Kim stood up for her beliefs and for the law. In Kentucky, if you issue a license that's not authorized by statute, it is a criminal violation. And that statute has not been changed by the General Assembly in the Commonwealth of Kentucky."

Huckabee, a Baptist minister and former Arkansas governor, denounced the Supreme Court decision in June legalizing gay marriage. The court ruled 5-4 in the case.

"And we do not want to see this country become the smoldering remains of what once was a great republic where the people ruled and is exchanged for a place where five unelected lawyers think that they can rule. We're here to say, `No they cannot.'"

While Davis was in jail, deputy clerks from her county issued marriage licenses to several same-sex couples.
