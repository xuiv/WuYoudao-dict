**伊朗总统对美国国会涉入核协议不屑一顾**

伊朗总统鲁哈尼星期三说，伊朗正在跟世界六大国、而不是跟美国立法国会议员谈判一项最后核协议。

鲁哈尼的讲话显然是对星期二华盛顿的事态进展作出的反应。奥巴马总统星期二保证签署一个将伊核协议提交美国国会审议的议案。

鲁哈尼在北方城市拉什特对数千名伊朗人发表讲话时还重申，除非同时解除所有制裁，否则德黑兰不会签署最后协议。

美国国会参议院外交关系委员会星期二在两党议员作出妥协后通过一项议案，对伊核协议设定了一个30天审议期，并要求总统每90天确认一次伊朗遵守了限制其核活动的协议。如有违反，国会将立即重新实施对伊朗的制裁。

克里国务卿星期三表示，奥巴马总统同意签署国会议案之后，他相信能够同伊朗达成一项最后协议。

克里在德国举行的七国集团外长会议上做出上述表示。预计七国外长讨论的议题将包括伊核谈判。这个月早些时候，谈判各方达成了一项框架协议。

Iran's President Dismisses US Congressional Involvement in Nuclear Deal

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani says Iran is in talks to reach a final nuclear agreement with six world powers, not with U.S. lawmakers.

Mr. Rouhani's remarks on Wednesday were an apparent reaction to developments Tuesday in Washington, where President Barack Obama pledged to sign a bill that would subject the agreement to U.S. congressional review.

In a speech to thousands of Iranians in the northern city of Rasht, Mr. Rouhani also reiterated his stance that Tehran will not sign a final nuclear deal unless all sanctions are simultaneously lifted.

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed a measure Tuesday after a bipartisan compromise that calls for a 30-day review period and for the president to certify every 90 days that Iran is living up to the deal curbing its nuclear activity. Sanctions levied by Congress would be immediately re-imposed in case of a violation.

On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said he is confident about reaching a final agreement with Iran, after Mr. Obama agreed to sign the congressional measure.

Kerry spoke before a meeting of Group of Seven foreign ministers in Germany that was expected to include discussion on the negotiations, which yielded a framework deal earlier this month.

**中国经济增长速度降至六年来最低点**

星期三公布的数据显示，中国经济上季度的增长速度是六年来的最低点，使得人们再度关注这个世界第二大经济体的经济状况。

2015年第一季度，中国经济增长速度降至7%，而上季度为7.3%。自2009年初世界金融危机以来，这是中国经济增长速度最慢的一个季度。

中国执政党共产党将2015年的经济增长设在7%的适度的目标。虽然这一增幅属于世界主要经济体增幅最大之列，却是中国多年来的最低点。

中国国家统计局发言人星期三针对这一数据表示，经济增速减缓在北京的预料之中。他说，中国政府将这一现象归结为“全球经济复苏缓慢”，以及“中国目前正在进行的经济结构改革”。

China Economic Growth Hits Six-Year Low

China's economy grew at its slowest pace in six years last quarter, according to data released Wednesday, raising fresh concerns over the condition of the world's second largest economy.

Growth declined to 7 percent in the first quarter of 2015, down from 7.3 percent in the previous quarter. That is the slowest quarterly growth rate since early 2009 during the aftermath of the global financial crisis.

China's ruling Communist Party has set a modest target of 7 percent growth for 2015. While that rate of expansion would be among the fastest of any major economy, it would be China's slowest pace in a quarter of a century.

Reacting to the figures, a spokesman for China's National Bureau of Statistics said Wednesday that Beijing expected the slowdown. He said the government attributes this to "sluggish global economic recovery" and "ongoing structural reforms."
