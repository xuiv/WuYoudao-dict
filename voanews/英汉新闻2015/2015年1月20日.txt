German Police Raid 13 Properties Related to Friday Terror Arrests

German police have conducted raids on 13 properties in Berlin and elsewhere in Germany, a followup to last week's arrest of two men suspected of recruiting fighters for the Islamic State group.

A police spokesman said the residents of the raided properties were alleged associates of the two men arrested Friday.

The Deutsche Welle broadcast service reported that the residents of the raided properties were not treated as suspects - but that various objects, including computer hard drives, had been confiscated.

Police throughout Europe have been on heightened alert since the terrorist attacks in France earlier this month.


**中国去年经济增长率低于预期**

北京发布的新数据显示，中国经济增长率处于24年来的最低点。预计这一趋势将在2015年持续下去。

中国政府星期二说，中国2014年的经济增长率仅为7.4%，没有达到预期的7.5%。

分析人士说，考虑到2014年不良贷款激增、信用大跌以及房地产价格下滑等因素，中国去年的经济增长率本来可能更低。

预计房地产价格将在2015年继续成为中国经济增长的障碍，而这将影响到其他经济领域。专家担心，通货紧缩将使中国国内各产业面临需求减少的问题。

世界银行说，中国经济增长率继续下降可能对世界市场造成影响，从而抵消美国及英国劳工市场持续经济增长而产生的积极影响。

在中国新发布的数据影响下，国际货币基金组织下调了对未来两年全球经济增长的预期。该组织警告说全球主要经济体疲弱将比油价下跌带来根大的消极影响。不过最近几周的油价下跌得到消费者的欢迎。

Chinese Economic Growth Slower Than Expected

China's economy has grown at its slowest pace in 24 years, and the cooling trend is expected to continue into 2015, according to new figures released by Beijing.

China's government said Tuesday that its economy grew by only 7.4 percent in 2015, just missing its predicted growth rate of 7.5 percent.

Analysts say the rate is not as bad as it could have been, given a year when bad loans spiked, credit collapsed, and key real estate prices fell.

Property values are expected to be a continuing drag on the economy in 2015, with the power to affect a variety of other economic sectors. Experts worry about the onset of a deflationary cycle that would slow down demand across a range of Chinese domestic industries.

The World Bank says a continuation of the Chinese slowdown could affect world markets, negating the positive effect of increasing economic activity in U.S. and British labor markets.

The new Chinese figures have influenced the International Monetary Fund to downgrade its forecasts for global growth over the next two years. It warns that weakness in major global economies will outweigh the effect of lower oil prices, which consumers have welcomed in recent weeks.
