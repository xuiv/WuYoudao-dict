Nigeria's Boko Haram Pledges Allegiance to Islamic State

The militant Group Boko Haram has pledged allegiance to Islamic State, amid reports that a series of bombings has killed more than 50 people in Nigeria's Borno state where Boko Haram is active.

Jihadist monitoring group SITE on Saturday quoted Boko Haram as saying "We announce our allegiance to the Caliph" in a video purporting to be from the Nigerian rebel group.

Both groups seek to rule and impose their strict interpretations of Islamic law, and both have embraced using brutal tactics to achieve results.

Boko Haram is suspected carrying out several bomb attacks killing 50 people and wounding dozens more Saturday in Maiduguri, a city where it has strong influence.

After participating in a mock election Saturday, Nigerians upset with the government's handling of Boko Haram marched for better security and a fair presidential election late this month.

President Goodluck Jonathan has faced scathing criticism for his handling of Boko Haram and his inability to bring home hundreds of school girls kidnapped by the extremist more than a year ago.

Concern over Boko Haram's insurgency prompted election officials to postpone the presidential elections last month, delaying voters chance to select their next leader.

Officials and voters are hoping the militants don't disrupt the March 28 vote, despite their previous threats to cause trouble.
