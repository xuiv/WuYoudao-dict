**联合国谴责巴黎事件后反对接纳难民之声**

联合国难民机构对要求遏制难民重新安置计划的政府提出了批评。之前，人们发现，巴黎恐怖袭击者当中有一人混入逃离叙利亚涌入欧洲的难民群中。

联合国难民事务高级专员公署的发言人说：“我们对把难民群体妖魔化的言辞深感不安。”她说：“这将导致仇外心理和恐惧。”

一些欧洲官员呼吁本国政府停止接纳更多难民。

上周五巴黎发生致命恐怖袭击之后，美国50名州长当中至少有27人以及几位2016年总统候选人呼吁终止或推迟奥巴马总统在今后12个月接纳1万名叙利亚难民的计划。

UN Denounces Calls for Refugee Curbs in Aftermath of Paris Attacks

The U.N. refugee agency is criticizing governments that are demanding refugee resettlement programs be curbed, after the discovery one of the Paris attackers slipped into Europe in the wave of Syrian migrants escaping the country's war.

"We are deeply disturbed by language that demonizes refugees as a group," a U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees spokeswoman said in Geneva. She says "it will contribute to xenophobia and fear."

Some European officials have called for an end to accepting more refugees in their countries.

Following last Friday's deadly attacks in Paris, at least 27 of the 50 U.S. state governors and several 2016 Republican presidential candidates have called for an end or delay in President Barack Obama's plan to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees during the next 12 months.


**美国通胀率小幅上升，加息可能性增加**

美国十月份通货膨涨率小幅上涨，增大了美联储将很快加息的可能。

政府报告显示，9月份价格上涨了0.2个百分点，除去价格波动较大的能源和食品之外，美国消费价格比去年相比上涨了1.9%，这接近于美联储的2%的目标。

专家们说，缓和稳定的通胀率可以让民众和企业为购买住房和设备作出更好计划，而这回促进经济增长。

美联储官员曾表示，他们希望看到通涨率小幅上升之后再提升利率。目前人们普遍预期美联储将在今年12月中提高自金融危机以来的历史最低水平利率。

另一项报告显示，美国制造业今年10月份增长了0.4个百分点，而上个月则有所收缩。制造业一直由于外国市场需求放缓而受到冲击。美元的强势也伤害了美国出口，包括制造业的产品，因为那使得美国产品价格更高，在全球市场上竞争力降低。

US Inflation Up Slightly, Raising Chance of Interest Rate Hike

A key measure of U.S. inflation rose slightly in October, boosting the chances the central bank will raise interest rates soon.

A government report says prices gained two-tenths of one percent in September. Apart from energy and food, sectors with volatile price changes, U.S. consumer prices rose 1.9 percent over the past year - close to the Federal Reserve's target of two percent.

Experts say a modest and consistent rate of inflation allows families and companies to better plan purchases of homes and equipment, which facilitates economic growth.

Fed officials have said they want to see inflation rise a little before they boost interest rates. They are widely expected to raise the key rate in mid-December from the record low level where it has been since the financial crisis.

A separate report said the U.S. manufacturing sector rose a brisk four-tenths of a percent in October, after falling the prior month. Manufacturing has been hampered by slowing demand in foreign markets. The strong dollar also hurts U.S. exports, including manufactured goods, by making them more expensive and less competitive on global markets.
