**人权观察: 严重关注也门平民死于空袭**

人权观察组织星期四说，沙特阿拉伯领导的联盟本星期早些时候对也门发动的一次空袭造成至少29人死亡，引起人们对违反战争法问题的严重关注。

人权观察敦促参与那次空袭行动的军队展开调查，并呼吁美国确保采取预防措施，以保护也门平民。

人权观察的中东北非部负责人斯托克说：“如此众多的平民在一个看来并没有军事目标的营地丧生，这使得人们更加关注违反战争法的问题。”

联合国秘书长潘基文说，他“深切关注”也门北部马兹拉德营地星期一遭到空袭以及也门其他平民死亡事件。

星期三，也门西部一个牛奶场发生爆炸，造成至少35人死亡。爆炸原因尚未确定，究竟是空袭还是反政府武装发动袭击，有着相互矛盾的报道。

Airstrike on Camp Raises 'Grave Concerns' in Yemen

Human Rights Watch said Thursday that an airstrike by the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen that killed at least 29 people earlier this week "raised grave concerns about violations of the laws of war."

The group called on the forces involved in the attack to conduct an investigation, and for the United States, which is giving logistical and intelligence support, to make sure precautions are being taken to protect Yemeni civilians.

"The deaths of so many civilians in a camp with no apparent military target heightens concerns about laws-of-war violations," said Joe Stork, HRW's Middle East and North Africa director.

United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was "deeply concerned" about the attack Monday on the Al-Mazrad camp in northern Yemen as well as other civilian casualties in Yemen.

On Wednesday, at least 35 people died in an explosion at a dairy in western Yemen. The cause of that blast has not been determined with conflicting reports about whether another airstrike or anti-government fighters were responsible.


**伊朗外长:核谈判取得重大进展**

伊朗外长扎里夫星期四说，围绕伊朗核项目的谈判取得了“重大进展”，但伊朗和世界六强国尚未达成协议。

扎里夫是在瑞士城市洛桑举行的谈判间歇时对记者做出上述表示的。双方本来把星期二午夜设为达成框架协议的最后期限，目前谈判已经进入最后期限过后的第二天。签订协议的目的是对伊朗核项目加以限制，作为交换条件，国际社会取消对伊朗的经济制裁。

星期四早上，扎里夫与美国国务卿克里以及伊朗和各国代表团的专家们进行了数小时会谈。

美国国务院发言人哈夫星期三晚间说，双方在谈判中取得了进展，但尚未达成政治谅解。

如果伊朗与六强国达成一项框架协议，双方将争取在6月30日最后期限前达成一项最终协议。六强国包括美国、英国、中国、法国、俄罗斯和德国。

Iranian FM Cites 'Significant Progress' in Extended Nuclear Talks

Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said Thursday there was "significant progress" in negotiations on the country's nuclear program, but that Iran and a group of world powers did not yet have an agreement.

Zarif spoke to reporters in Lausanne, Switzerland, during a break in the talks, which continued for a second day past the original midnight Tuesday deadline for reaching a framework deal curbing Iran's nuclear activity in exchange for sanctions relief.

Zarif met for several hours early Thursday with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and experts from the Iranian and international delegations.

U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said late Wednesday that the two sides were making progress but "have not reached a political understanding."

If Iran and the group that includes the U.S., Britain, China, France, Russia and Germany agree on a framework, they would then proceed to crafting a final deal by a June 30 deadline.
