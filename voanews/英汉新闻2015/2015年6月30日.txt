**希腊债务违约或成定局**

希腊银行星期二继续关门。希腊拖欠国际货币基金组织18亿美元贷款，看来债务违约几乎将成定局。

星期二，希腊的经济前景仍不明朗。希腊财政部说，将开放全国各地约1000家银行，让很多没有自动提款卡的退休人员这个星期能够支取足够现金。

希腊人7月5号将就欧盟提出的新一轮紧缩措施举行公投。齐普拉斯总理反对这些紧缩措施。

齐普拉斯星期一表示会尊重公投结果。但他同时警告说，他的左翼政府绝不会推行新的改革。欧洲债权国要求希腊改革，以换取数十亿美元的新救助资金。

Greece Poised for Default on IMF Payment

Greek banks remain shut on Tuesday as the nation looks set to formally default on a $1.8 billion loan repayment to the International Monetary Fund.

While the country's economic future remained uncertain early Tuesday, the Greek finance ministry said it will open about 1,000 bank branches across the country to allow pensioners, many of whom do not have ATM cards, to withdraw enough money to get through the week.

Greeks are set to vote July 5 in a referendum on a new round of European austerity measures, which Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras opposes.

Mr. Tsipras said Monday he will respect the outcome of Sunday's referendum, but he cautioned that his far-left government will not be the one to carry out the new reforms. European creditors are demanding the reforms in exchange for billions of dollars in new bailout money.

**法检察官:袭击美工厂嫌疑人有恐怖动机**

一位法国检察官说，法国里昂一家美国工业气体工厂上星期五遇袭事件具有伊斯兰国极端组织作案的特征。

检察官莫林斯星期二说，将雇主斩首、并袭击这家工厂的嫌疑人萨利赫有恐怖主义动机。莫林斯还说，萨利赫在审讯中交代，他将被害者斩首，把头颅挂在围墙上，最大程度地示众。

萨利赫行凶后很快被捕，目前因涉嫌恐怖主义活动而被关押。萨利赫涉嫌于上星期五开车冲入工厂，并制造爆炸。

France Prosecutor: Factory Attack Bore Markings of Islamic State

A French prosecutor says Friday's attack on a U.S. gas factory in Lyon bears the hallmarks of the Islamic State militant group.

Prosecutor Francois Molins said Tuesday that the man who is suspected of carrying out the attack, Yassin Salhi, had a "terrorist motive" when he beheaded his employer and attacked the gas factory. "Salhi decapitated his victim, he hung the head on a fence to get maximum publicity, as he told us during interrogation," said Molins.

Salhi, who was arrested soon after the attack, is being held on suspicion of terrorism.

He is suspected of crashing his vehicle onto the factory grounds and causing an explosion Friday.

After Friday's attack, French President Francois Hollande raised the security level in the region of Rhone-Alpes to the highest possible level.
