**欧盟和土耳其就难民危机达成数十亿美元协议**

欧盟星期天同意就解决难民潮问题同土耳其达成一项总额数十亿美元的协议。今年由于世界其他地区的冲突和不稳定，迫使人们大量逃离家园，出现的难民潮已经使双方都陷入困境。

在比利时首都布鲁塞尔召开的一次峰会上，土耳其和欧盟官员讨论了32亿美元的一揽子援助方案，旨在帮助土耳其应对身处该国的数以百万计的难民。

今年抵达欧洲人数最多的叙利亚难民，都是通过土耳其抵达希腊或者保加利亚的。

欧洲理事会主席图斯克在与土耳其总理达武特奥卢和欧盟委员会主席容克一起召开的记者会上说，“我们的协议为及时在我们共同的边界重建秩序制定了明确的计划。”

图斯克还表示，有关土耳其加入欧盟的谈判将重新启动。

土耳其1997年被宣布有资格加入拥有28个成员国的欧盟，2005年正式开始入盟谈判。

EU, Turkey Reach Billion-Dollar Deal Over Migration Crisis

The European Union agreed to a multi-billion-dollar deal with Turkey on migration on Sunday to address the flow of migrants that has swamped both of them this year as conflicts and instability in other parts of the world forced huge numbers of people to leave their homes.

A summit in the Belgian capital, Brussels, drew Turkish and European officials to discuss a $3.2 billion aid package intended to help Turkey cope with the millions of refugees it is hosting.

The largest group of Syrian migrants arriving in Europe this year have passed through Turkey on their way to Greece or Bulgaria.

"Our agreement sets out a clear plan for the timely re-establishment of order at our shared frontier," European Council President Donald Tusk told a news conference with Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.

Tusk also said talks regarding Turkey's accession to the European Union will be "re-energized."

Turkey was declared eligible to join the 28-member bloc in 1997 and officially began the process in 2005.

**布基纳法索举行新总统和议会选举**

非洲国家布基纳法索的选民星期天投票选举了新一任总统和议会。这次选举被称为是布基纳法索历史上最为开放的一次大选。

该国五百万注册选民有资格从14名总统候选人当中选出一位新总统。

历时12个小时的投票在当地时间下午大约6点结束。官员们开始计票工作，最初计票统计结果预计星期一晚间公布。如果没有候选人在星期天的选举中赢得超过半数选票的话，将举行第二轮投票，以定乾坤。

布基纳法索前总统孔波雷在领导布基纳法索27年之后，去年试图改写宪法，取消对总统的任期限制，以便自己再度执政。此举引发抗议，并迫使他辞职。

孔波雷辞职后，布基纳法索是由一个临时政府领导。大选原本定于10月份举行，但是军方发起的短暂的失败政变，迫使选举被推迟到本周日举行。

Burkina Faso Votes for New President, Parliament

Voters in Burkina Faso have voted Sunday for a new president and parliament in what is being called the country's most open election in its history.

Five million registered voters were eligible to select from among a slate of 14 presidential candidates.

Twelve hours of voting ended about 6 p.m. local time. Officials have begun counting the ballots and the first results are expected late Monday. If no one earns more than 50 percent of the vote, a second round will be held.

Former President Blaise Compaore led Burkina Faso for 27 years before trying last year to get rid of a constitutional term limit and make himself eligible for another round in office. That move brought protests that forced him to resign.

An interim government replaced Compaore, and the election was supposed to take place in October, but a brief, failed military coup forced the process to be postponed.
