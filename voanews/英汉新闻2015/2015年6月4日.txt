**乌克兰总统: 俄罗斯可能发动新的袭击**

乌克兰总统波罗申科警告说，乌克兰东部分离分子控制区内有9千名俄罗斯军人。他警告说，乌克兰必须警惕大规模袭击。

波罗申科星期四在议会讲话时说，乌克兰面临新的重大攻击的"巨大威胁"。

在此前一天，乌克兰东部分离分子的主要据点顿涅斯克附近爆发战斗。

顿涅斯克附近的一家露天市场疑遭火箭炮弹袭击，消防人员紧急扑灭火灾。

俄罗斯当局一直否认直接卷入乌克兰危机，并一再否认向乌克兰反政府武装提供武器和战斗人员。

俄罗斯、乌克兰、法国和德国今年二月签署的停火协议要求冲突双方从接触地区撤走重型武器。但是国际观察人员说，这些规定经常被违反。

Ukrainian President: Possible colossal new attacks from Russia

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has warned that there are 9,000 Russian troops in the rebel-controlled area of eastern Ukraine and warned the country must be on alert for a large-scale attack.

Mr. Poroshenko made the comment to parliament Thursday, saying there exists a "colossal" threat of major new attacks.

He spoke a day after a major battle flared outside a main separatist stronghold in eastern Ukraine.

Firefighters scrambled to put out a fire at an open air market near Donetsk following a suspected rocket attack.

The Kremlin insists it has no direct role in the crisis, and has repeatedly denied supporting the rebellion with arms and fighters.

The truce signed by Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany in February required both sides to withdraw heavy weapons from the line of contact.

But international observers say those provisions have been routinely violated.


**柬埔寨从澳大利亚接受首批难民**

柬埔寨从澳大利亚接受了首批寻求避难者，这是重新安置难民协议的部分安排。这种做法受到人权组织的广泛批评。

在金边国际机场，柬埔寨官员证实难民已于星期四抵达，并将这批难民交给了国际移民组织，由该组织负责对他们重新安置。

国际移民组织发表声明说，该组织将着手为这些难民提供基本支持，包括语言培训、文化和社会知识介绍以及教育、医疗和就业等方面的服务。

声明说，将鼓励和支持这些难民融入柬埔寨社会，并在最短时间内做到自立。

柬埔寨去年与澳大利亚达成3200万美元的重新安置难民协议。澳大利亚拒绝接受这些难民，他们被暂时安置在太平洋岛国瑙鲁的拘留中心。

批评人士说，这项协议显示澳大利亚不顾国际责任，将难民抛弃在柬埔寨，澳大利亚是世界上最大的经济体之一，而柬埔寨则是世界上最贫穷的国家之一。

Cambodia Receives First Asylum Seekers from Australia

Cambodia has received its first group of asylum seekers from Australia, as part of a refugee resettlement deal that has been widely criticized by human rights groups.

Officials at the Phnom Penh international airport confirmed the refugees arrived Thursday and were handed over to the International Organization for Migration, which is helping resettle them.

In a statement, IOM said it will "begin to provide essential support, including language training, cultural and social orientation, education services, health services, and employment services" for the asylum seekers.

"They will be encouraged and supported to integrate into the Cambodian community and become self-reliant as quickly as possible," said the statement.

Cambodia last year reached a $32 million agreement to resettle refugees who were rejected by Australia and are now being held in a detention center in the Pacific island nation of Nauru.

Critics say the deal amounts to Australia, one of the world's biggest economies, neglecting its international responsibilities and dumping refugees off on Cambodia, one of the world's poorest countries.
