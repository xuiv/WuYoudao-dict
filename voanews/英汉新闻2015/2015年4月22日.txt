**小型无人机落日本首相官邸屋顶**

日本当局发现一架小型无人机降落在安倍晋三首相官邸的屋顶上，随后对此展开调查。

日本NHK广播公司说，这架四旋翼无人机长约50厘米，装有一架照相机、一只塑料瓶以及一个类似照明灯的装置。

多家媒体还报道说无人机装饰放射性标志，而共同社报道飞行器上检测到微量辐射。

电视画面显示，数十名警察在盖着蓝色篷布覆的无人机周围徘徊。

目前还不清楚这架无人机的操纵者，也不清楚操纵者的动机。没有关于有人受伤的报道。安倍首相当时正在印尼出席一个会议，因此不在首相官邸。

Drone Found On Roof of Japanese PM's Office

Japanese authorities have launched an investigation after discovering a small drone on the roof of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's office.

The four-propeller drone measured about 50 centimeters in diameter and was carrying a camera, a plastic bottle, and a flare-like device, according to national broadcaster NHK.

Several media outlets also reported the drone was decorated with a radioactive symbol, and the Kyodo news agency reported a small amount of radiation was measured on the craft.

Television footage showed dozens of police officers hovering around the drone, which was covered by a blue tarp.

It is not clear who sent the drone or what their motive may have been. There have been no reported injuries. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was away from his office at the time, attending a conference in Indonesia.

**安倍对日本战时行为表示懊悔但未道歉**

日本首相安倍晋三星期三发表演讲，表示对日本的战时行为深感懊悔，但没有像其前任那样对日本殖民侵略的受害者正式道歉。

安倍在印度尼西亚召开的亚非峰会上发表演讲时，以隐晦的方式指责了中国。很多人希望峰会给东京和北京修复关系带来机会。

在亚非峰会召开之前，这位持保守立场的日本首相对当地媒体说，他没有必要重复其前任在1995年和2005年做出的里程碑式道歉。

安倍在雅加达发表演讲时，只是顺带提到日本的军国主义历史，表示东京对其战时行为深感懊悔，但坚称日本领导人长期以来一直奉行和平原则。

安倍还说，国际社会绝不能听任强者使用武力欺负弱者。安倍看来是在暗指中国。中国被指责欺负其邻国，而中国与日本在东中国海的领土争端日趋激化。

在亚非峰会开幕之前拍摄大合照时，安倍与中国国家主席习近平互致问候，并礼貌地握手。日本官员说，预计安倍与习近平星期三晚些时候将举行一次较为正式的会晤。

Japan's Abe Expresses 'Remorse,' But Offers No Apology for Wartime Past

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe expressed "deep remorse" for Japan's wartime past in a speech Wednesday, but failed to repeat previous official apologies to the victims of Japan's colonial aggression.

Prime Minister Abe also took a veiled swipe at China during his closely watched speech at the Asia-Africa summit in Indonesia, which many hoped would serve as an opportunity for Tokyo and Beijing to mend damaged ties.

In the lead-up to the event, the conservative Japanese leader had told local media outlets there was no need for him to reiterate the same landmark apologies made by his predecessors in 1995 and 2005.

His Jakarta speech made only passing reference to Japan's past militarism, noting Tokyo had "feelings of deep remorse over the past war" but insisting its leaders had long ago committed to the principles of peace.

Mr. Abe also said the international community should "never allow to go unchecked the use of force by the mightier to twist the weaker around." This was an apparent reference to China, which has been accused of bullying its neighbors and is involved in a worsening dispute with Tokyo over a group of strategic islands in the East China Sea.

Earlier, Prime Minister Abe and Chinese President Xi Jinping exchanged greetings and politely shook hands at a photo session to kick off the conference. Japanese officials say they expect the two leaders to hold a more formal meeting later Wednesday.
