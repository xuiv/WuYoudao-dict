**国际货币基金组织将人民币纳入主要货币**

国际货币基金组织星期一将人民币纳入其关键国际货币篮子。这给与全球第二大经济体一个新的地位。

国际货币基金组织说，人民币“符合所有现有条件“加入该组织特别提款权货币群。这些货币包括美元、欧元、日元和英镑。特别提款权是该组织用于向188个成员国发放危机贷款的金融标准。这一决定将于明年10月生效。

国际货币基金组织总裁拉加德说，这个决定是“中国经济和全球金融系统整合中一个重要的里程碑。”

她还表示，这也是“对中国当局在过去一些年改革中国货币和金融系统的认可。”

特别提款权并非自由交易的货币，但是作为一种国际储备资产而具有重要性。分析人士说，国际货币基金组织的决定将促使北京兑现其承诺，让人民币在全球各地更为“自由使用”，国际货币基金组织认为北京已经做到这一点。

在国际货币基金组织的货币篮子中，人民币的权重为10.92％，这是用来衡量在得到该组织的贷款时该货币国得到的比重。人民币加入之后，美元仍维持42％的权重，而欧元、英镑和日元的权重降低。

除此之外，人民币被纳入国际货币基金组织的货币篮子将使得人民币在全球金融市场得到新的地位，可能会促使对人民币和人民币为主的资产的需求。

IMF Adds China's Yuan to Its Basket of Leading Currencies

The International Monetary Fund added China's yuan to its basket of key global currencies on Monday, a move that gives new status to the world's second leading economy.

The IMF said that the Yuan, also known as the Renminbi, "met all existing criteria," to be added to the U.S. dollar, Europe's euro, the Japanese Yen and the British Pound as one of the currencies in the world organization's Special Drawing Rights grouping, the financial standard it uses in issuing crisis loans to its 188 member nations. The action takes effect next October.

IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said the decision is "an important milestone in the integration of the Chinese economy into the global financial system."

"It is also a recognition," she said, "of the progress that the Chinese authorities have made in the past years in reforming China's monetary and financial systems."

The Special Drawing Rights are not a freely traded currency, but are important as an international reserve asset. Analysts say the IMF action could push Beijing to live up to its promises to make the Yuan even more "freely usable" across the world, a standard the IMF concluded Beijing has already met.

The yuan will have a 10.92 percent weighting in the IMF's currency basket, a measure that determines which currencies countries can receive when they secure IMF loans. When the yuan is added to the basket of currencies, the dollar will retain its share of about 42 percent, with reduced shares for the euro, British sterling and the Japanese yen.

The addition of the Yuan to the IMF basket could give it new respect in world financial markets, possibly fueling demand for the currency and for Yuan-dominated assets.

**美国为反恐新增对访美旅客过滤措施**

在巴黎发生恐怖袭击之后，美国星期一强化了免签证项目，对来自全球各地38个现有的免签证国家的访美旅客新增过滤措施。

白宫说，国土安全机构正迅速对其电子免签证通关系统做出改变，以获取访美旅客是否到过任何美国认为是“恐怖分子藏身之敌”的国家的信息。

除此之外，华盛顿表示正在考虑试点方案，增加对旅客进行生物识别筛选，例如从获取指纹或者照片，到对获准登上飞往美国班机的旅客的监视程序。

每年有两千万来自与美国有免签证协议的38个国家的外国游客来美。白宫说，当局近年来一再加强对来美旅客的审查，而“鉴于巴黎发生的恐怖袭击和来自外国恐怖分子持续不断的威胁”也正在加强审查。

白宫表示正在寻求国会批准一些新的安全措施，包括增加对那些无法识别旅游者护照信息的航空公司增加罚款，从5千美元增加到5万美元。美国还寻求在这38个国家和国际刑警组织间增加对潜在恐怖分子的信息共享，并更好地跟踪丢失和被盗的旅行证件。

US Adds New Anti-Terror Screening for Travelers Headed to US

The United States tightened its visa waiver program Monday in the wake of the Paris terrorist attacks, adding new screening for travelers headed to the U.S. from 38 countries around the world who now are allowed to enter the country without a visa.

The White House said the country's homeland security agency is immediately altering its electronic visa-free clearance system to capture information on whether U.S.-bound travelers have made any trips to countries the United States considers to be a "terrorist safe haven."

In addition, Washington said it is considering pilot programs to add the use of biometric screening for travelers, such as taking their fingerprints or photographs, to the monitoring process before passengers are allowed to board flights headed to the United States.

Each year, 20 million foreign visitors head to the U.S. from the 38 countries the U.S. has partnered with in the visa-free program. The White House said authorities have repeatedly increased their scrutiny of U.S.-bound travelers in recent years and are tightening them even more "given the terrorist attacks in Paris and the ongoing threat posed by foreign terrorist fighters."

The White House said it is seeking quick congressional approval for some of the new security measures, including an increase in fines, from $5,000 to $50,000, against airlines that fail to verify a traveler's passport data. The U.S. is also looking to increase information sharing about possible terrorists among the 38 countries and the international police agency Interpol, and to better track lost and stolen travel documents.
