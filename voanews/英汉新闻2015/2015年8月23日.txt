**也门亚丁警察总部被毁 疑为基地组织所为**

也门官员表示，该国南部港口城市亚丁的秘密警察总部星期六在炸毁。也门方面称这一爆炸案是基地组织发动的。

目前还没有任何人员伤亡的报道。基地组织的武装人士据说进入了亚丁，而就在几个星期前，亲政府的武装力量刚刚从胡塞反对武装那里将亚丁夺回。

基地组织对亚丁部分地区的控制被认为是正在进行的也门内战的又一个令人担忧的局势变化。到目前为止持续了五个月的内战已经导致了数千人丧生。

美国方面认为基地组织也门分支是这一恐怖组织当中破坏力最大的一个分支。美方针对基地组织也门分支发动了数十起无人机空袭行动，并且成功炸死了该组织

不只一位高层领导人。

Police HQ Destroyed in Yemen’s Aden, al-Qaida Blamed

Yemeni officials are blaming al-Qaida for a bomb that destroyed secret police headquarters in the southern port city of Aden Saturday.

No casualties are reported. Al-Qaida fighters are said to have moved into the city after pro-government forces took it back from Houthi rebels several weeks ago.

The al-Qaida takeover of parts of Aden is seen as another troubling development in a five-month-old civil war that has already killed thousands.

The United States considers al-Qaida's Yemen affiliate to be the terrorist group's most dangerous branch. The U.S. has launched dozens of drone strikes against al-Qaida members in Yemen, killing a number of senior leaders.

**意大利地中海救出三千难民**

意大利海岸警卫队说，意大利海军响应20多艘船只发出的求救请求，在利比亚沿海救起三千多难民。

意大利一直在采取类似救援行动，将数百名难民救上岸，但是星期六的行动规模异常大。

截至目前，今年有10万多人越过地中海抵达意大利。不过旅程非常危险，小型船只要么在波涛中挣扎，要么因人太多而超载。

2300多人今年试图抵达欧洲时遇难。2014年全年有3279人遇难。

欧洲疲于应对大量难民涌入。难民经常首先在意大利和希腊上岸，然后他们有时前往欧洲北部国家，那里的许多社区欢迎他们，而有的社区则抗议他们的到达。

Italy Rescues 3,000 Migrants in Mediterranean

Italy's coast guard says the navy has rescued 3,000 migrants off the coast of Libya after responding to requests for help from more than 20 vessels.

Italy has been routinely carrying out similar rescues, bringing hundreds of migrants to its shores, but the scale of Saturday's operation was unusually large.

So far this year, more than 100,000 people have made the Mediterranean crossing to Italy. The journey is dangerous, with small boats struggling in rough waters or overloaded with too many people.

More than 2,300 people have died trying to reach Europe this year. There were 3,279 fatalities for all of 2014.

Europe has struggled to cope with an influx of migrants. They often first land in Italy and Greece, and then sometimes head to Europe's northern countries, where some communities have welcomed them and others have protested their arrival.
