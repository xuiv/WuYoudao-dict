**美国古巴就互设使馆达成协议**

一名美国高层官员说，美国和古巴已经同意在时隔50多年后在彼此的首都重设大使馆。

白宫说，奥巴马总统计划星期三在玫瑰园发表一项有关古巴问题的声明，此外克里国务卿将在维也纳发表相关讲话。目前克里在维也纳参加与伊朗的核谈判。

古巴外交部说，设在哈瓦那的美国利益办事处负责人戴洛伦提斯星期三将转达奥巴马总统有关重开使馆事宜的信件。

奥巴马和古巴主席劳尔·卡斯特罗去年12月宣布，美古两国经过数月秘密会谈后，将恢复在冷战期间中断的外交关系。

此后，美古两国代表团在华盛顿和哈瓦那举行了几次会谈，拟定重开使馆的细节。今年4月，奥巴马和卡斯特罗在巴拿马举行的一次地区峰会期间进行了具有历史意义的面对面会晤。随后，美国将古巴从支持恐怖主义国家名单中去除。

奥巴马对古巴的态度在国会遭到强烈反对，很多议员指责奥巴马无视古巴恶劣的人权纪录。

共和党控制的国会可能拒绝为美国在古巴建立新大使馆拨款，并可能阻挠奥巴马提出的驻古巴大使人选获得批准。此外，美国国会不大可能同意奥巴马总统取消对古巴的贸易禁运。

US, Cuba Reach Deal to Open Embassies in Washington and Havana

A senior U.S. official says the United States and Cuba have agreed to reopen embassies in each other's capitals for the first time in more than 50 years.

The White House says President Barack Obama plans to make a statement on Cuba Wednesday from the Rose Garden, while Secretary of State John Kerry will speak in Vienna, where he is taking part in nuclear talks with Iran.

Cuba's foreign ministry says the chief of the U.S. interests section in Havana, Jeffrey DeLaurentis, will deliver a note Wednesday from Mr. Obama on reopening embassies.

Mr. Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro announced last December the two countries were ready to restore normal diplomatic relations that were severed at the height of the Cold War, after a several months of secret talks.

Since then, delegations from both sides have held several meetings in each other's capitals to iron out the details of reopening their embassies. Mr. Obama and Mr. Castro held a historic face-to-face meeting back in April on the sidelines of a regional summit in Panama, followed by Cuba's removal from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism.

Mr. Obama's efforts to end the Cold War-era antagonism faces strong opposition in Congress, with many lawmakers accusing the president of ignoring Cuba's poor record on human rights.

The Republican-controlled legislature could deny funding for a new embassy in Cuba, and block Mr. Obama's choice of a new ambassador. It is also unlikely to agree to his request to lift the U.S. economic embargo on Cuba.


**美法院:国家安全局可恢复搜集电话数据**

美国一家法院做出判决，国家安全局可以暂时恢复大规模搜集美国人电话通话数据的项目。

外国情报侦察法庭星期一裁定，国家安全局可以恢复大规模搜集美国人的电话通话数据，包括通话时间、日期和时长，以寻找与外国恐怖分子联系的线索。

一家上诉法院今年5月做出裁决说，美国爱国法案从未授权国家安全局搜集此类数据，因此这一项目被中止。

该项目于6月1日失效的一天后，美国总统奥巴马签署了一项叫做“自由法案”的新法律，对大规模搜集电话通话数据项目进行了重大改革和缩减。

星期一晚间做出的判决允许该项目根据新法律恢复运作180天。在这六个月内，国家安全局将建立一个替代性系统，使电信公司得以储存有关数据。

US Court: NSA Can Resume Bulk Data Collection

A U.S. court has ruled that the National Security Agency can temporarily resume its bulk collection of Americans' telephone records.

The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court on Monday ruled that the NSA could resume gathering millions of Americans’ phone metadata — call times, dates and durations — to scan for links to foreign terrorists.

The program was suspended after an appeals court in May ruled that the U.S. Patriot Act had never authorized the NSA to collect such data.

A new law, called the Freedom Act, which substantially reformed and narrowed the bulk phone data program, was signed by U.S. President Barack Obama a day after the existing program lapsed on June 1.

The ruling late Monday allows the program to resume for 180 days, in compliance with the new law. The six month period was designed to give the NSA time to set up an alternative system in which the data is stored by the phone companies.
