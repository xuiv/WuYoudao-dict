**习近平重申致力于司法改革**

中国国家主席习近平重申致力于改革腐败丛生的司法制度，但强调中共不会放松对法院的控制。

一系列引起高度关注的错判削弱了民众对中国法院的信任。中国法院对被告的定罪率将近100%，而且长期依靠逼供定罪。

据中国官方的新华社报道，习近平在本周一次讲话中承认中国司法制度存在弊端，包括不公和错判。

习近平说，如果这些问题不能及时得到解决，就会阻碍法治进步，并损害社会公平和公正。

但习近平同时强调，中共将继续掌控法院，声称这体现了社会主义司法制度的基本特点和政治优势。

China's Xi Vows Legal Reforms to End 'Injustice'

Chinese President Xi Jinping has reaffirmed his commitment to reform the country's corruption-riddled legal system, but stressed the Communist Party will not loosen its grip over the courts.

A series of high-profile wrongful convictions has helped sap public confidence in China's courts, which have a conviction rate of nearly 100 percent and have long relied on forced confessions.

In an address this week, President Xi acknowledged that malpractice, including "injustice and wrongful convictions," remain a problem, according to a report in the official Xinhua news agency.

If these issues are not addressed "in a timely manner," the Communist Party leader said "they would hinder the progress of the rule of law, and damage social fairness and justice."

But Mr. Xi emphasized the party will continue to exercise authority over the courts, saying this "represents the basic characteristics and political advantages of the socialist judicial system."

**美国空袭伊拉克战略重镇提克里特**

星期三，美国领导的联军对伊拉克重要战略城市提克里特的伊斯兰国目标发动空袭。此前伊拉克总理阿巴迪请求联军支持夺回提克里特的攻势，这一行动已经持续了一个月。

伊拉克军队和什叶派民兵在地面作战，不过一直拒绝外来的空中支援。但是在提克里特城外迅速取得进展后，攻势陷于停顿。

指挥联军作战的美国中将特里说，空袭能更有效地帮助伊斯兰军队将激进分子赶出提克里特。

特里说：“发动空袭是要精确地捣毁伊斯兰国的据点，拯救无辜的伊拉克人的生命，同时最大程度地减小对基础设施的附带损害。”

提克里特是萨拉赫丁省的首府，位于首都巴格达和伊拉克第二大城市摩苏尔之间。自去年6月以来，摩苏尔一直处于伊斯兰国战斗人员控制之下。

US Launches Airstrikes on Tikrit

UPDATE: updates US Iraq 1st UPD from 3/25; new lede & grafs 2-4, 7-9))

Warplanes from a U.S.-led coalition launched airstrikes against Islamic State targets in the Iraqi city of Tikrit on Wednesday, after Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi requested support for a month-old offensive to retake the strategic area.

Iraqi troops and Shi'ite militias have been battling on the ground, and had resisted asking for outside air support, but after quick gains outside Tikrit, the effort stalled.

U.S. Lt. Gen. James Terry, who commands the coalition effort, said the airstrikes will better enable the Iraqi forces to oust the militants.

"These strikes are intended to destroy ISIL strongholds with precision, thereby saving innocent Iraqi lives while minimizing collateral damage to infrastructure," he said.

Tikrit is the capital of Salahuddin province, an area located between the capital, Baghdad, and Iraq's second largest city of Mosul that has been controlled by Islamic State fighters since June.
