**美国否认对法国总统奥朗德进行窃听**

白宫表示，美国现在并未对法国总统奥朗德进行窃听，而且今后也不会这样做。此前维基揭秘网站声称，该网站公布的文件显示美国国家安全局对奥朗德及法国两位前任总统进行窃听。

这些文件的真实性尚未得到证实。维基揭秘与法国《解放报》以及网站Mediapart联合公布了有关文件。

美国国家安全局发言人普赖斯说，奥巴马政府没有进行任何外国情报侦测活动，除非出于某项具体而切实的国家安全目的。他表示，这样的标准适用于世界领导人和“普通公民”。

普赖斯没有说明过去是否曾对法国总统进行窃听。

法国总统的一名助手说，预计奥朗德星期三将同法国国防委员会对维基揭秘公布的文件进行评估。

U.S. says it isn't Targeting Hollande's Communications

The White House says it is not targeting French President Francois Hollande's communications and will not do so, after transparency website WikiLeaks released documents that it says shows the U.S. National Security Agency spied on him and his two predecessors.

There was no immediate confirmation of the accuracy of the documents, which were released by WikiLeaks in collaboration with French daily newspaper Liberation and investigative website Mediapart.

NSA spokesman Ned Price said the Obama administration does not conduct any foreign intelligence surveillance unless there is a "specific and validated national security purpose," a standard he said applied to both world leaders and "ordinary citizens."

The spokesman did not address whether French presidential communications had been wiretapped in the past.

A French presidential aide says Mr. Hollande is expected to meet Wednesday with his defense council to evaluate the information published by Wikileaks.

抗议活动从去年9月爆发。在抗议活动的高潮时刻，数万示威者走上香港街头，要求对选举特首的方式进行改革。

Last Hong Kong Pro-Democracy Protest Site Dismantled

Hong Kong officials have dismantled the last of the tent camps from last year's mass protests that unsuccessfully pushed for democratic reforms in the Chinese territory.

Protesters put up little resistance as a crew of government officials moved in Wednesday to clear the few tents, banners and other materials that remained at the outpost outside the territory's legislature.

"I feel calm. I am already missing this place, because in the past 200 days or so we witnessed history and the change of an era," said 71-year-old protester Simon Wong. "Here we have seen a lot of emotions, a lot of tears, a lot of sweat, a lot of human kindness, but we have also seen a lot of conflict."

At the height of the protests, which began last September, tens of thousands of demonstrators took to Hong Kong's streets to push for a change in how the way the territory elects its leaders.
