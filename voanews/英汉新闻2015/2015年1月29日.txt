**在以色列发现古代头盖骨**

科学家们在以色列的一个洞穴中发现了一个残缺的古代头盖骨。他们认为这是证明人类从非洲向欧洲迁徙理论的第一个实物证据。

专家们在《自然》杂志发表文章说，这个残缺的头盖骨大约来自5万5千年前。人类学家认为人类穿越中东的迁徙发生在那个时候。

这个头盖骨类似在欧洲发现的其他头盖骨，看上去像是专家所说的“现代人”。这证明了一种理论，即现代人与尼安德特人存在于同一时期，并可能相互交配。

Ancient Skull Found in Israel, Evidence of Human Migration

Scientists have found part of an ancient skull in a cave in Israel that they say is the first physical evidence of human migration from Africa to Europe.

Writing in the journal Nature, experts say the partial skull is about 55,000 years old - dating back to the time when anthropologists believe the migration passed through the Middle East.

The skull looks like others found in Europe and resembles the bones of what experts call "modern man," bearing out theories that modern men and their ancestors, Neanderthals, existed at the same time and possibly interbred.


**苏杰生就任外交国务秘书**

印度总理莫迪免去最高外交官史瓦拉吉的职务，并任命印度常驻联合国代表苏杰生接任。一天前，美国总统奥巴马对印度进行了一次成功的访问。

星期四，苏杰生就任印度外交国务秘书。

印度媒体报道说，苏杰生改善了印美两国关系，包括安排莫迪于去年9月访问华盛顿。此次任命是对他的褒奖。

2013年12月，印度驻纽约副总领事柯布拉加德因被指伪造签证而遭逮捕，此后美印关系出现倒退。柯布拉加德去年1月离开美国，目前在新德里就职。

苏杰生曾担任印度驻华大使和驻新加坡大使。

Subrahmanyam Jaishankar appointed as India's foreign secretary

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has fired the country's highest ranking diplomat and replaced her with India's ambassador to the United States, a day after a successful visit to India by U.S. President Barack Obama.

Subrahmanyam Jaishankar took over as India's foreign secretary Thursday.

Indian media reported that the appointment was Jaishankar's reward for turning around India's ties with Washington, including organizing Mr. Modi's visit to Washington in September.

India-U.S. ties suffered a set-back after New Delhi's deputy consul general in New York, Devyanai Khobragade, was arrested in December 2013 on visa fraud charges. She left the United States in January last year and now works in New Delhi.

Jaishankar has previously served as India's ambassador to China and Singapore.
