**俄罗斯议会批准在叙利亚用兵**

俄罗斯议会上院投票批准普京总统的要求，同意向叙利亚派兵，援助正在打击伊斯兰国组织激进分子的阿萨德政府。

俄罗斯政府发言人对国家电视台表示，投票涉及在叙利亚动用俄罗斯空军部队。

五角大楼官员说，近几个星期，俄罗斯向叙利亚北部地区派遣轰炸机、喷气机和地面部队，增加它在叙利亚的军事力量。

普京总统星期一在联合国大会发言时谈到俄罗斯在叙利亚发挥了日益重要的作用。他说，叙利亚总统阿萨德的部队正在“与恐怖主义分子面对面地英勇作战”，拒绝与他们合作大错特错。他批评西方为叙利亚温和派反叛分子提供武装，并说这些人与伊斯兰国组织站在一起。

Russian Parliament Approves Use of Military Force in Syria

Russia's upper house of parliament has approved a request by President Vladimir Putin to deploy military forces abroad in Syria to aid the government of Bashar al-Assad in the fight against Islamic State militants.

A government spokesman said on state television that the vote regarded use of the Russian air force in Syria.

Russia has been building up its forces in Syria, with bombers, jets and troops arriving in northwest Syria in recent weeks, according to Pentagon officials.

On Monday, President Putin addressed the growing role of Russia in Syria, telling the United Nations General Assembly that the forces of Syrian President Assad are "valiantly fighting terrorism face to face" and that refusing to cooperate with them is "a huge mistake." He criticized the West for arming "moderate" rebels in Syria, who, he said, joined forces with the Islamic State group.

**川普坚称减税免税 大幕险砸费奥丽娜**

美国共和党总统竞选活动进入新的一周，出现了一些难忘时刻。领先者川普星期一在纽约公布了他的税务计划，而对手卡莉·费奥丽娜在圣·安东尼奥一次活动中，险些被倒塌的大幕砸到。

川普承诺为中产阶级和美国富人减税，对年收入不到两万五千美元的人免税。川普还表示，将把大公司税收减半，并为小企业减税，二者均可创造新就业。

川普表示，将取消富人的税务减免，堵塞税务漏洞。他说：“我们将切实降低税收，简化并取消那些实际上已过时的减税项目。”

川普的共和党对手对此没有置评。参议员卢比奥在电台采访中以强烈口气说：“我没有兴趣和他你来我往，出演或加入他的怪人秀。”

领先的民主党总统参选人希拉里·克林顿猛烈抨击川普的主张，称富人是主要受益者。不过，克林顿和川普都批评那些有利于投机者的税务漏洞，例如，对冲基金项目和避税现象等。

川普星期一在川普大厦其本人办公室内与基督教和犹太教领袖会谈，而且反应不错。牧师沃克斯· 帕普说：“他没有为了赢得支持而迎合我们，他同我们平等交谈。”

不过，民调显示，这位亿万富翁的共和党竞争对手们正在急起直追，前外科医生本·卡森在民调中只落后川普一个百分点。

共和党总统候选人本·卡森说：“这部分反应了我们在竞选途中所看到的，人山人海，热情高涨。”

前企业高管卡莉·费奥丽娜星期一竞选时遇到惊险一刻，她在讲话时险些被一面倒向舞台的沉甸甸的大幕砸到。费奥丽娜说：“大家没有事吧？有人受伤吗？”

费奥丽娜甚至玩笑地说，大幕压顶可能是川普或克林顿安排的。

Trump Vows to Cut Taxes, Fiorina Escapes Falling Curtain

The Republican presidential campaign entered a new week with some memorable moments. Frontrunner Donald Trump revealed his tax plan on Monday in New York while rival Carly Fiorina barely escaped a falling curtain wall at an event in San Antonio.

Trump promised to cut income taxes for middle-class as well as wealthy Americans, while eliminating them altogether for people making less than $25,000 a year. He also said he would slash corporate taxes by half and reduce taxes for businesses, both to help create new jobs. He said he would eliminate exemptions and close tax loopholes for the rich.

Trump said: "We are lowering taxes very substantially, we are simplifying and we are getting rid of deductions that are actually obsolete."

Trump's Republican rivals did not have comments. Senator Marco Rubio was quite emphatic about it during a radio interview. He said: "I am not interested in the back and forth to be a member or part of his freak show."

Democratic Party presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton slammed Trump's proposal, saying the rich would benefit most from it. But both she and Trump have criticized the loopholes that help speculators, such as hedge funders, avoid taxes.

Trump was well received at a meeting with Christian and Jewish clergy Monday in his Trump Tower offices.

Vox Pop, Pastor, said: "He wasn't trying to pander to us to gain our support. He was speaking to us as one of us."

But the polls show the billionaire's Republican rivals catching up to him, with former surgeon Ben Carson only one point behind in opinion surveys.

Republican Presidential Candidate, Ben Carson said: "It kind of reflects what we've been seeing out on the road - just tremendous crowds but enormous enthusiasm."

Former business executive Carly Fiorina had a memorable moment during her campaign Monday when she barely escaped a heavy curtain wall crashing onto the stage where she spoke.

Carly Fiorina said: "Is everybody all right? Was anybody hurt?" Fiorina even joked that the fall could have been arranged by Trump or Clinton.
