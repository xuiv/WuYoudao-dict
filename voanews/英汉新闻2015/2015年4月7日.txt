**印度协助23国公民撤离也门**

印度表示，23个国家寻求印度帮助把各自国家的公民撤离遭受战乱的也门。此前新德里实施大规模行动通过海上和空中撤离印度公民。

印度总理莫迪在推特上对救援行动表示支持。他说，撤离行动“反映了我们为人民提供服务的决心和帮助其他面临困难国家的愿望。”

印度到目前为止撤离了大约3000人。在也门工作的印度人有一半是护士。印度还帮助其他国家的公民撤离。

有些人乘小船被带上军舰。由于战火，军舰无法停靠在亚丁。印度还寻求沙特阿拉伯协助，经由也门领空的安全通道将另一些人撤离。

印度有大规模撤离的经验，近年来在乌克兰、伊拉克、伊朗和利比亚进行过撤离行动。

印度还是在印度洋地区开展人道救援行动的主要国家。去年12月马尔代夫出现饮用水短缺，印度舰船和飞机向那里送水。

India: 23 Nations Seek Help in Evacuating Citizens from Yemen

India says 23 countries have sought its help in evacuating their citizens from war-torn Yemen after New Delhi mounted a massive operation to bring out its citizens both by air and sea.

In a tweet, Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his support to the rescue effort saying the evacuation efforts “reflect our willingness to serve our people and readiness to help others in distress.”

India has brought out some 3,000 people so far. About half its nationals working in Yemen are nurses. It has also helped some citizens of other countries.

Some were brought out in small boats to naval ships, which could not dock at Aden due to shelling. Others have been brought home by air after India sought Saudi Arabia’s assistance to gain safe access to Yemeni airspace.

India has past experience in large scale evacuation efforts. In recent years it has carried out similar operations in Ukraine, Iraq and Libya.

New Delhi has also been taking the lead in humanitarian missions in the Indian Ocean region. In December, Indian ships and planes ferried water to Maldives when it was hit with a drinking water shortage.

New Indictment in Islamic State Terror Plot

A fourth man in New York City is facing charges in a previously announced plot to provide material support to Islamic State militants.

Federal and local authorities announced Monday that 26-year-old Dilkhayot Kasimov was indicted by a grand jury along with three other men who were arrested back in February.

Kasimov is accused of working with another man, Abror Habibov, to raise $1,600 to help a third man, Akhror Saidakhmetov, to travel to Syria in order to join the Islamic extremist group.

Court papers say Saidakhmetov was arrested at John F. Kennedy Airport as he was attempting to board a flight to Istanbul, Turkey.

Prosecutors also say a further investigation uncovered electronic messages from Kasimov urging others to participate in "violent jihad." He faces a total of 30 years in prison if convicted. He is scheduled to make his first court appearance on Wednesday.
