**奥巴马就伊核协议在美利坚大学讲话**

美国总统奥巴马正在尽很大的努力，来捍卫国际间最近有关伊朗核问题达成的协议。奥巴马总统说，这项协议成功地“切断了伊朗方面制造核弹的所有渠道”。

奥巴马总统星期三在位于首都华盛顿的美利坚大学发表讲话时再三强调“这是一个很不错的协议。”

奥巴马总统说，假如得到落实的话，这项协议将有利于伊朗，有利于美国，也有利于整个饱受战火之灾的中东地区，乃至全世界。

奥巴马呼吁美国民众打电话给那些对这项协议持有怀疑态度的国会议员，希望国会下个月投票时能够让这项协议顺利成为立法。

上述协议将禁止伊朗制造核武器。作为交换条件，联合国和西方国家将取消之前施加给伊朗的一系列制裁。那些制裁措施达到了削弱伊朗经济的目标。

反对这项协议的人士说，文件中核实伊朗是否确实遵守了协议的规定过于软弱。

奥巴马总统断然回绝这种批评，说这是国际间到目前为止所达成的最为强有力的一项核不扩散条约了。

Obama American University Address on Iran Nuclear Deal

U.S. President Barack Obama is vigorously defending the international accord to restrain Iran's nuclear program by saying it "cuts off all of Iran's pathways to a bomb."

"It is a very good deal," Mr. Obama said Wednesday in an address at American University in Washington.

He said if the pact is implemented, "that would be good for Iran. It would be good for the United States. It would be good for a region that has known too much conflict. It would be good for the world."

He urged Americans to call skeptical lawmakers in the U.S. Congress to urge them to approve the pact when they vote on it next month.

The deal would bar Tehran from building a nuclear weapon in exchange for lifting United Nations and Western sanctions that have hobbled Iran's economy.

Opponents say provisions to verify that Iran is complying with the accord are too weak.

Mr. Obama rebuffed such criticism, saying, "This is the strongest non-proliferation [agreement] ever negotiated."


**日本对美国监听表示“严重关切”**

日本首相安倍晋三对据称美国暗中监视日本政府高级官员和企业高管表示“严重关切”。

日本内阁官房长官菅义伟说，安倍首相在与美国副总统拜登的电话交谈中要求就此事展开调查。

菅义伟说，拜登对这件事在日本“激起争论”给日方造成困扰，表示非常抱歉。他没有说拜登是否承认美国进行了监听。

经常爆料的维基揭秘上周公布了一些文件，说这些文件显示美国暗中监视日本的35家企业、政府部门和个人。

维基揭密称，监听的主要内容包括美日关系、贸易谈判和气候变化战略等，监听行动可以追溯到2006年安倍首相的第一个任期时。

美国白宫周二晚间的一份声明中说，拜登在电话中向安倍晋三重申了美国“对美日同盟的坚定承诺，并感谢安倍首相与美国持久的伙伴关系。”

Japan Expresses 'Serious Concern' Over US Spying Reports

Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has expressed his "serious concern" over allegations the United States spied on senior Japanese government and business officials.

Prime Minister Abe also called for an investigation into the matter during a phone call with U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, according to Japan's top government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga.

Suga said Biden apologized for the matter, noting it has "stirred up debate in Japan." He did not say whether Biden specifically confirmed the spying.

Media whistleblower WikiLeaks last week published documents it says show the U.S. spied on 35 companies, government ministries, and individuals in Japan.

WikiLeaks said the intercepts related to topics such as U.S.-Japan relations, trade negotiations, and climate change strategy. It said the surveillance dates as far back as 2006, the first term of Prime Minister Abe.

In a statement late Tuesday, the White House said Biden used his phone call with Mr. Abe to reaffirm the United States' "strong commitment to the U.S.-Japan alliance and thanked Prime Minister Abe for his enduring partnership."
