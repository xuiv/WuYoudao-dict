**前参议员桑托勒姆第二次竞选总统争取共和党提名**

美国前参议员里克.桑托勒姆星期三将宣布竞选共和党总统候选人提名。这是他第二次竞选总统。

57岁的桑托勒姆将在宾州一家制造厂宣布参选。他1991年到2007年曾代表宾州出任联邦众议员和参议员，但2007年竞选连任参议员失败。

桑托勒姆第一次竞选共和党候选人时并不被看好，但令政治观察家感到吃惊是他却在有影响力的艾奥华州共和党党团投票中以微弱多数击败罗姆尼，并以他强烈的社会保守主义吸引了很多支持者。接着他又在10个州赢得共和党的选票，但最终还是输给了获得共和党提名的罗姆尼。

尽管2012年竞选政绩不错，桑托勒姆这次参选仍将是一场苦战。目前已有10几位共和党人正式宣布或考虑宣布参加竞选党内提名，包括前州长杰布·布什和赫卡比，参议员保罗、卢比奥和克鲁兹，以及退休外科医生卡森等，其中很多人具有很强的社会保守主义业绩。

Rick Santorum to Make Second Run for Republican Presidential Nomination

Former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum will launch his second campaign for the White House on Wednesday, joining an already crowded field seeking the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.

The 57-year-old Santorum will make the announcement at a manufacturing plant in Pennsylvania, the state he represented in both the House and Senate for several years from 1991 until 2007, when he lost his Senate re-election bid.

Santorum was little regarded when he launched his first bid for the Republican nomination in 2012, but stunned political observers when he narrowly won the influential Iowa party caucuses over Mitt Romney, drawing supporters attracted to his strong social conservatism. Santorum went on to win 10 more state caucuses and primaries before his campaign lost momentum to Romney, the party's eventual nominee.

Despite his strong showing in 2012, Santorum faces another uphill battle in the upcoming race, with well over a dozen candidates who have either formally entered or are considering entering the race, including former governors Jeb Bush and Mike Huckabee, current senators Rand Paul, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, and retired surgeon Ben Carson, many with strong social conservative credentials.

**美韩日: 必须就朝鲜核项目加紧对平壤施压**

美国、韩国和日本的核谈判代表在星期三举行的会议上达成共识。三方同意必须加强对朝鲜施压和制裁，同时继续争取通过外交途径解决朝鲜的核武器项目问题。

美国的朝鲜政策特别代表金成在首尔会谈结束后表示，朝鲜实施核项目的用意是显而易见的。他说，无论朝鲜核项目发展到什么阶段，都应加以关注。

在此次会议举行之前，朝鲜宣称其核项目取得了新进展，但没有得到证实。几年来，朝鲜一直威胁要对美国、韩国和日本进行核打击。

韩国特使黄浚局说，目前的局势不明而且紧张。他星期三说，朝鲜在继续推进其核项目。

美国和韩国特使将前往北京会见中国特使，继续争取就朝鲜核项目问题统一立场。

US, South Korea, Japan Agree on Need to Pressure Nuclear North Korea

Top nuclear negotiators from the United States, South Korea and Japan agreed in a meeting Wednesday that they need to increase pressure and sanctions against North Korea while continuing diplomatic efforts to address the country's nuclear weapons program.

Sung Kim, the U.S. special representative for North Korea policy, said after the talks in Seoul that North Korea's nuclear intentions are clear. "We should be concerned regardless of the stage of their development," he said.

The meeting comes after new, but unverified, claims of nuclear advancements by North Korea, which has threatened for years to carry out a nuclear attack on the U.S., South Korea and Japan. The three nations were part of unsuccessful six-party disarmament talks to address North Korea's nuclear arsenal.

South Korean envoy Hwang Joonkook described the situation as uncertain and tense, saying Wednesday that North Korea continues to advance its program.

The U.S. and South Korean envoys are due to travel to Beijing to meet with their Chinese counterpart, as they continue working on a unified approach to North Korea.
