Typhoon Soudelor moved inland China leaving eight dead

Heavy rain continued Sunday in southeastern China where the remnants of Typhoon Soudelor moved further inland leaving flooding and at least 14 people dead.

The system, which was downgraded to a tropical storm, hit China's Fujian and Zhejiang provinces the hardest, killing eight people there while triggering mudslides. It knocked out power to more than a million people, and authorities said 250,000 were evacuated from their homes.

On Saturday, the storm swept across Taiwan with winds of up to 160 kilometers per hour, leaving three million households without power and littering roads with uprooted trees.

Officials in Taiwan said the typhoon killed at least six people there. An 8-year-old girl, her mother and twin sister were among the dead or missing after being swept out to sea along the country's east coast.

Soldiers and rescue crews with search dogs worked through mud and debris Sunday to begin recovery efforts following the storm.

Though the typhoon weakened before reaching land, forecasters said it was at one point the strongest typhoon so far this year.

**长崎纪念原子弹爆炸70周年**

日本长崎市星期天纪念原子弹爆炸70周年。美联社报道说，当年爆炸的幸存者呼吁废除核武器并制止日本政府推动放宽军事限制的行为。

在日本首相安倍晋三出席的仪式上，长崎原子弹爆炸幸存者的一位代表发言说，安倍政府出台安全立法违背了幸存者的意愿，并“会导致战争”。

包括美国大使卡罗琳·肯尼迪在内的来自75个国家的代表在长崎和平公园参加纪念活动。

当地时间上午11点02分，随着钟声敲响，人们默哀一分钟。70年前的这一时刻，美国的B-29飞机空投原子弹，造成超过7万人丧生，最终促使日本二战投降。3天前在广岛爆炸的第一颗原子弹致使大约14万人死亡。

Nagasaki marked the 70th anniversary of the atomic bombing

The city of Nagasaki marked the 70th anniversary of the atomic bombing Sunday with calls to abolish nuclear weapons and halt the Japanese government's push to loosen restrictions on what its military can do.

With Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in the audience, a representative of Nagasaki atomic bomb survivors told an annual ceremony that security legislation introduced by Abe's government goes against the wishes of the survivors and ``will lead to war.''

Representatives from 75 countries, including U.S. Ambassador Caroline Kennedy, were among those gathered under a tall white canopy to shade them from the sun on a 31-degree-Celsius morning at Nagasaki Peace Park.

As a bell tolled, they observed a minute of silence at 11:02 a.m., the time when the a U.S. B-29 plane dropped the atomic bomb, killing more than 70,000 people and helping to prompt Japan's World War II surrender. The first atomic bomb in Hiroshima three days earlier killed an estimated 140,000.
