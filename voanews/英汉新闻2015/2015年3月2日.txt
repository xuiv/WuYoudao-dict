**克里在联合国人权理事会就乌克兰东部发表讲话**

美国国务卿克里星期一在日内瓦联合国人权理事会发表讲话指出，乌克兰东部的男女老少“正在被杀害、折磨和强奸”。

此前，俄罗斯外交部长拉夫罗夫在人权理事会会议上说，乌克兰停火已经取得了“实质性进展”。他敦促基辅与他所称的“极端分子”拉开距离。

美国及其欧洲盟国正在考虑针对莫斯科在乌克兰的行动对俄罗斯采取进一步制裁措施。乌克兰总统波罗申科指责俄罗斯支持的分离分子继续违反停火协议。

联合国人权理事会星期一说，自2014年4月以来，尽管相继有过停火，乌克兰东部仍有6千多人丧生。

Kerry spoke on eastern Ukraine at U.N. Human Right Council

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry says men, women and children in eastern Ukraine "are being killed, tortured and raped." The top U.S. diplomat made the comments Monday in Geneva where he addressed the U.N. Human Right Council.

Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told the human rights forum that "tangible progress" has been achieved concerning the cease-fire in Ukraine, and he urged Kyiv to distance itself from what he called "extremists."

The U.S. and its European allies are considering additional sanctions against Moscow for its actions in Ukraine, where President Petro Poroshenko has said Russian-backed separatists continue to violate a cease-fire agreement.

The U.N. Human Rights Office said Monday more than 6,000 people have been killed in eastern Ukraine since April 2014, "in spite of successive cease-fires."


**内塔尼亚胡将对美国亲以组织发表演讲**

以色列总理内塔尼亚胡星期一将于华盛顿在一个亲以色列组织的会议上发表演讲。星期二，他将在美国国会发表讲话，此举使他与白宫之间产生摩擦。

内塔尼亚胡去年曾在美国以色列公共事务委员会举行的政策会议上发表演讲，但是这次演讲安排在他前往美国国会之前。美国国务卿克里称这种情况“未必史无前例，但有些奇怪”。

美国国会众议院议长贝纳邀请内塔尼亚胡星期二在国会发表演讲。他打破了以往的惯例，在发出邀请前没有同白宫进行协调。

克里试图淡化有关分歧。有关官员说，克里星期一将在联合国人权委员会上表示对以色列的支持。

克里星期日在美国广播公司的电视节目上说：“以色列总理在美国发表演讲显然是受欢迎的。我们目前在安全事务上与以色列的关系比以往任何时候都更加密切。”

Netanyahu to Address Pro-Israeli Group Ahead of Congress Speech

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was due to speak at a pro-Israeli group's conference Monday in Washington, one day ahead of his address to the U.S. Congress that has caused friction with the White House.

Mr. Netanyahu spoke at the policy meeting for the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) last year, but this time will do so before going in front of Congress under circumstances that Secretary of State John Kerry described as "odd, if not unique."

Republican House Speaker John Boehner invited the Israeli leader to give his Tuesday address, breaking with historical protocol of coordinating with the White House.

Kerry has sought to downplay any rift, and is due to support Israel in an appearance Monday before the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, officials said.

"The prime minister of Israel is welcome to speak in the United States obviously, and we have a closer relationship with Israel right now in terms of security than in any time in history," Kerry told ABC television's This Week program on Sunday.
