**前喜剧演员莫拉雷斯当选危地马拉总统**

危地马拉星期日举行总统选举，没有任何政界资历的前电视喜剧演员莫拉雷斯获胜，将出任下届总统。

莫拉雷斯在总统大选中轻易获胜。此前一桩腐败丑闻导致现任总统下台，并激起选民对政界的愤怒情绪。

莫拉雷斯持保守立场。他今年4月开始竞选时，支持率仅为0.5%。

莫拉雷斯利用自己是政界圈外人的身份，承诺建立一个廉洁的政府。在一起涉及巨额款项的丑闻调查导致佩雷斯总统辞职和被捕后，莫拉雷斯的民调支持率大幅上升。佩雷斯被控犯有腐败罪，目前正在听候审判。

94%的投票站已将选票清点完毕，莫拉雷斯获得69%选票，前第一夫人托雷斯获得31%的选票，她也誓言打击腐败，但很多危地马拉选民将她视为旧有政治体制中的一员。

Guatemala Elects Comedian as President

A former television comedian with no political experience was the victor in Sunday's election for Guatemala's next president.

Jimmy Morales easily won the country's top office after a corruption scandal toppled the country's last leader and fueled voter outrage with the political establishment.

The conservative Morales started the race with just 0.5 percent support back in April.

Playing up his outsider status and promising clean government, Morales surged in opinion polls after a probe into a multi-million dollar customs racket led to the resignation and arrest of President Otto Perez, who is awaiting trial on corruption charges.

With 94 percent of the polling stations reporting, Morales won 69 percent of the votes against 31 percent for former first lady Sandra Torres who also vowed to tackle corruption, but was seen by many as part of the old political order.

Whale Watching Boat Sinks Off Canada, 5 Dead

At least five people are dead after a whale watching boat sank Sunday afternoon off Canada's west coast.

It is not yet clear what caused the boat to go down near Tofino, British Columbia, with 27 people on board.

The Joint Rescue Coordination Center said 21 people were rescued and one was still missing. Most of those rescued were taken to hospitals. A spokeswoman for Island Health said one person was in serious condition, but stable.

The boat was operated by Jamie's Whaling Station, which takes people out on boats for several hours in the waters around Vancouver Island to see Gray whales and Humpback whales, according to its website.

The company said late Sunday it would release more information about the incident later after focusing on the rescue efforts for the passengers and crew.
