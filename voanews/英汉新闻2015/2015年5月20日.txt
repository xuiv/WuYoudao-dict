Myanmar 'Ready to Help' Stranded Boat People

Myanmar, which has received international criticism for its role in Southeast Asia's migrant crisis, now says it is ready to help the thousands of migrants and human trafficking victims stranded at sea.

A foreign ministry statement on Wednesday said Myanmar is deeply concerned "with the sufferings and life-threatening fate" of the so-called boat people, mostly minority Rohingya from Myanmar and Bangladesh.

"Myanmar stands ready to provide humanitarian assistance to anyone who suffered in the sea," said the statement, which added "serious efforts" are being taken to prevent human trafficking and illegal migration, including regular air force and navy patrols.

The crisis began earlier this month when Thailand disrupted longstanding human trafficking networks that targeted Rohingya. The people smugglers fled, leaving thousands of boat people adrift at sea.

加拿大警方在蒙特利尔主要机场拘留了10名年轻人，他们涉嫌准备出国加入伊斯兰国激进组织。

自那时以来，加拿大当局逮捕了涉嫌试图出国加入圣战组织的几名年轻人。

Canada Detains 10 Youths Suspected of Jihadist Ambitions

Canadian police have detained 10 young people at Montreal's main airport on suspicion of their preparing to travel overseas to join the Islamic State militant group.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said late Tuesday that they made the arrests last weekend at Montreal's Trudeau International Airport and withdrew the passports of the detainees.

Authorities said the families and friends of the detainees are being interviewed but no charges have been filed yet.

In a statement, the police asked the media to respect the privacy of the young people's families, noting that they are going through "very difficult times" as they try to cope with their children's actions.

Canadian authorities have been on alert for young people leaving the country to travel overseas and join the Islamic State, which controls territory in Iraq and Syria. A half-dozen young Canadians are believed to have traveled to Turkey in January, en route to Syria to join the group.

Since then, officials have arrested several other youths on suspicion of trying to travel overseas to join jihadist groups.
