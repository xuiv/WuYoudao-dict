China Expands Military Facilities on Man-Made Islands

China has nearly completed a military-length runway on one of the artificial islands it has built in the disputed South China Sea, according to satellite photos published by a maritime monitoring group.

The Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (AMTI) , which is affiliated with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says China continues to pave and mark the 3,000-meter airstrip, which analysts say is capable of accommodating any plane in China's air force fleet.

Additional military facilities - including two helipads, up to 10 satellite communications antennas, and a possible radar tower - are also being built on the Fiery Cross Reef, said the group's online report.

The reef is one of seven locations in the Spratly Islands where China is reclaiming land.


**联合国官员在伊朗会谈 争取解决核问题**

联合国核监察机构首脑星期四在德黑兰与伊朗官员举行会谈，为解决长期存在的伊朗核项目问题做最后的努力。

国际原子能机构总干事天野之弥与伊朗最高国家安全委员会官员沙姆哈尼举行了会谈，随后还将会见伊朗总统鲁哈尼。

国际原子能机构说，双方将讨论如何尽快解决目前仍然存在的问题，包括澄清伊朗核能力是否可能具有军事性质。

长期以来，伊朗一直否认正在研制核武器，并表示这一指称是与美国和以色列提供的虚假情报相关联的。

多年来，国际原子能机构试图通过调查找到答案，包括派检查员进入帕琴军事设施进行核查，但一直遭到伊朗的阻挠。

IAEA Chief, Iranian Officials Work to Resolve Nuclear Issues

The head of the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog met with Iranian officials Thursday in Tehran in the latest effort to resolve long-standing questions about the country's nuclear program.

International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Yukiya Amano held talks with the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, Ali Shamkhani, and was also due to meet with President Hassan Rouhani.

The IAEA said the officials were due to discuss how to more quickly resolve outstanding issues, including "clarification of possible military dimensions" of Iran's nuclear activity.

Iran has long denied working to develop nuclear weapons and said the allegations are linked to faulty intelligence from the United States and Israel.

The IAEA has tried for years to get answers in its probe, including having U.N. inspectors visit the Parchin military site, but has faced resistance from Iran.
