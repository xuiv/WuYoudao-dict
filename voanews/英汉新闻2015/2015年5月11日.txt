**法国总统奥朗德访问古巴**

法国总统奥朗德星期日晚间抵达古巴，成为第一位访问这个共产党国家的法国国家元首。

奥朗德在哈瓦那何塞·马蒂国际机场受到古巴副外长罗杰里奥·西埃拉和其他古巴高级官员的迎接。他说：“女士们，先生们，我今晚来到古巴，心情非常激动。具有象征意义的是，我是西方国家第一位参加古巴对世界开放的总统。”

奥朗德计划星期一会见古巴主席劳尔·卡斯特罗。卡斯特罗刚从意大利返回古巴，他出访期间在梵蒂冈拜会了教宗方济各。

自卡斯特罗和美国总统奥巴马去年12月宣布将寻求结束两国之间50多年来的紧张关系以来，奥朗德是第一位访问古巴的西方国家领导人。

美国对古巴实行贸易禁运，而巴黎和哈瓦那则保持着长期的经济关系，双边贸易额将近四亿美元。

古巴是奥朗德此次加勒比五国之行的最后一站。

French President Francois Hollande arrived in Cuba

French President Francois Hollande arrived in Cuba late Sunday night, becoming the first French head of state to visit the communist nation.

"Ladies and gentleman, I arrive here in Cuba this evening with a lot of excitement as this is the first time the president of the Republic of France is visiting Cuba. It's also symbolic to be the first western president to participate in the opening of Cuba to the world."

Mr. Hollande plans to meet with Cuban President Raul Castro Monday upon the Cuban leader's return from Italy, which included a visit with Pope Francis at the Vatican.

Mr. Hollande is the first Western leader to visit Cuba since Mr. Castro and U.S. President Barack Obama announced last December that they would seek to end more than five decades of Cold War-related bitterness.

But, unlike the U.S. trade embargo with Cuba, Paris and Havana have long-established financial ties, with two-way trade worth nearly $400 million.

Mr. Hollande's stopover in Cuba is the last stop on a five-nation tour of the Caribbean.


**沙特国王不拟参加美国 - 阿拉伯峰会**

沙特阿拉伯国王萨勒曼不准备参加美国总统奥巴马将于本星期主持召开的美国 - 阿拉伯峰会。沙特外交大臣阿祖贝尔星期日说，几天前宣布计划在白宫举行的一次会谈也被取消。

峰会将于星期三召开，海湾合作委员会六个成员国的代表团将造访白宫，星期四在美国总统度假地戴维营继续进行会谈。

阿祖贝尔说，萨勒曼国王将委派纳伊夫代为出席峰会。他解释说，这次峰会的时间与也门五天停火以及人道救援行动的时间重叠。此前沙特领导一个阿拉伯联盟对也门的反政府武装进行空袭。

奥巴马政府一名官员说，这一改变“并非针对任何实质问题作出的反应”。

Saudi King to Skip US-Gulf Summit

Saudi Arabia's King Salman will not take part in a U.S.-Arab summit hosted this week by President Barack Obama, Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said Sunday, canceling also a planned White House meeting that had been announced only days earlier.

The summit begins Wednesday with delegations from the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council visiting the White House, then continues Thursday with talks at the president's Camp David retreat.

Jubeir said King Salman will send Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef in his place. He cited the summit's overlap with a five-day cease-fire and humanitarian effort in neighboring Yemen where Saudi Arabia has led a campaign of airstrikes against anti-government fighters.

An Obama administration official said the change was "not in response to any substantive issue."
