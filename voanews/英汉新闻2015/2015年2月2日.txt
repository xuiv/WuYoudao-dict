在第四节比赛开始时，爱国者队比分落后，而该队四分卫布雷迪带领队友两次达阵，将比分反超，此时离比赛结束仅剩两分钟。西雅图四分卫拉塞尔•威尔逊将球队带入新英格兰境内。比赛结束仅剩几秒钟。威尔逊在33码给队员杰梅因•基尔斯投出壮观的一球。海鹰队马肖恩•林奇接球跑到了一码线，但接下来，威尔逊的传球被爱国者队的新手巴特勒抄截，爱国者队就此奠定胜局。

New England Patriots Reach NFL Elite Status With Super Bowl Win Over Seattle

The New England Patriots defeated the Seattle Seahawks 28-24 Sunday in the U.S. National Football League's annual Super Bowl championship game in Arizona, winning its fourth NFL title in 14 years.

The Patriots were trailing in the fourth quarter when Patriots quarterback Tom Brady led his team to two scoring drives to take the lead with just two minutes to go in regulation. Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson drove the team down deep in New England territory with just seconds remaining, capped by a spectacular 33-yard reception by Jermaine Kearse. Running back Marshawn Lynch ran the ball to the one-yard-line, but on the next play, Wilson threw a pass that was intercepted by Patriots rookie defensive back Malcolm Butler to seal the historic win.

For the third time in his career, Brady was named the game's most valuable player.

Under Brady and head coach Bill Belichick, the Patriots have joined such stellar NFL franchises as the Pittsburgh Steelers, San Francisco 49ers and Dallas Cowboys with four Super Bowl wins.


**中国警告美国领导人不要会晤达赖喇嘛**

白宫宣布美国总统奥巴马本周晚些时候将与西藏精神领袖达赖喇嘛在华盛顿共同出席国家早餐祈祷会后，中国星期一表示反对任何国家“以任何方式”与达赖喇嘛见面。

中国外交部发言人洪磊在记者会上还呼吁美国“以有利于双边关系利益”的方式处理这个问题。

白宫上星期宣布，奥巴马总统在2月5号的祈祷早餐会上将就宗教自由问题发表讲话。预计达赖喇嘛将出席。但美国政府没有宣布奥巴马总统和达赖喇嘛会进行任何直接会晤。

奥巴马总统上个月在华盛顿第三次会晤达赖喇嘛，中国官员对此备感愤怒。

北京认为达赖喇嘛是寻求西藏独立的危险分离主义分子。

China Warns US Against a Meeting With Dalai Lama

China said Monday it is opposed to any country meeting the Dalai Lama "in any manner," after the White House said U.S. President Barack Obama will attend the National Prayer Breakfast with the Tibetan spiritual leader this week.

At a press conference in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei also called on the U.S. to handle the matter "in the interest of bilateral relations."

The White House announced last week that Mr. Obama would deliver remarks at the February 5 prayer breakfast in Washington about the importance of religious freedom. The Dalai Lama is scheduled to attend. However, the Obama administration has not announced any direct meeting between the two.

Chinese officials were infuriated when Mr. Obama held his third meeting with the Dalai Lama in Washington last month.

Beijing regards the Dalai Lama as a dangerous separatist seeking to establish an independent Tibet.
