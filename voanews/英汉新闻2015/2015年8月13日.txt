**美国F16战机首次从土耳其发动空袭**

美国说，已经开始从一个土耳其空军基地执行针对叙利亚境内伊斯兰国目标的有人驾驶空袭使命。

五角大楼星期三晚间发表声明说，F16战机星期三早些时候从土耳其南部因瑟利克空军基地起飞执行空袭任务。

本月早些时候，联军开始从因瑟利克空军基地发动无人机空袭。

土耳其上月同意美国军队使用位于土耳其南部毗邻叙利亚的因瑟利克空军基地。

有关官员说，这一行动方案的目标是在叙利亚北部建立一个长约100公里的“无伊斯兰国区”。尽管土耳其政府长期以来一直要求在该地区设立一个禁飞区，但该方案并未纳入这一内容。

U.S. F-16s Fly First Anti-IS Missions from Turkey

The United States says it has begun flying manned missions from a Turkish air base to deliver air strikes against Islamic State targets in Syria.

The Pentagon released a statement late Wednesday saying the F-16 air strikes began earlier that day, launched from Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey.

The coalition began flying unmanned missions from the base earlier this month.

Turkey agreed last month to let U.S. forces use the Incirlik air base near Turkey's southern border with Syria.

Officials have described the plan as an effort to create an "Islamic State-free zone" stretching about 100 kilometers in length in northern Syria. It would not include a no-fly zone in the region, despite longstanding demands by the Turkish government for one.

Top Party Officials Apparently Ousted in Myanmar

Myanmar’s president is huddling with government ministers Thursday amid an apparent purge of the leadership of the country’s governing party.

President Thein Sein has the upper hand, according to one of his officials.

Zaw Htay, director of the president’s office told AFP, said that the president had made the move to remove party chairman Shwe Mann, who is also parliament speaker.

Officials of the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) told reporters that Shwe Mann has been ousted from his top party post and the USDP secretary general, Maung Maung Thein, was also removed.

Shwe Mann was widely perceived as being more politically accommodating with opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi than other more hardline members of his party.

The new chief of the party is vice chairman Htay Oo, according to Reuters, attributing this to a senior party official.
