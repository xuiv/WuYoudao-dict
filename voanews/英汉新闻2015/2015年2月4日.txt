**斯里兰卡总统呼吁民族和解**

斯里兰卡总统西里塞纳星期三承诺奉行民族和解政策。斯里兰卡近六年前结束了几十年的内战，但国家仍因内战而存在分歧。

西里塞纳在科伦坡举行的独立日庆典上发表了讲话。独立日庆典对在26年内战的丧生者表示哀悼。泰米尔少数民族在内战中跟政府军作战寻求独立。

西里塞纳说：“目前最大的挑战是通过民族和解进程使南北部民众团结一心。”

西里塞纳上个月击败前领导人拉贾帕克萨当选总统。拉贾帕克萨政府拒绝让国际社会对内战中可能犯下的战争罪进行调查。

联合国的一份报告说，斯里兰卡政府军在2009年结束对泰米尔武装攻势时，打死了4万泰米尔族平民。联合国说，斯里兰卡内战的死亡人数多达10万人。

**Sri Lankan President Calls for Reconciliation**

Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena pledged Wednesday to pursue national reconciliation in a country still divided by a decades-long civil war that ended nearly six years ago.

He spoke in Colombo at an Independence Day ceremony that paid respect to all those killed in the 26-year war that pitted government forces against rebels seeking an independent state for Sri Lanka's Tamil minority.

"The biggest challenge today is to unite the hearts of the people of the north and south through a national reconciliation process," Mr. Sirisena said.

The president was elected last month, defeating former leader Mahinda Rajapaska, whose government rejected an international investigation into allegations of possible war crimes during the conflict.

Government troops killed as many as 40,000 Tamil civilians during the offensive that ended the war in 2009, according to a United Nations report. The U.N. has said the total death toll during the war could be as high as 100,000 people.


**欧盟呼吁乌克兰各方立即停火**

欧盟外交政策主管呼吁乌克兰东部交战各方立即停火。 当地官员说，最新战斗造成3人死亡。

反政府武装控制的顿涅茨克市一家医院星期三受到到炮击，目击者看到至少三具尸体。

欧盟外交政策主管费代丽卡•莫盖里尼说，分离分子连续发动攻势引发战斗，特别是在德巴尔切夫附近的战斗造成巨大痛苦，破坏了推动政治解决的努力。她还说，无论在什么地方，炮击平民都严重违反国际人道主义法律。 火炮应立即撤离居民区。

莫格里尼呼吁双方立即停火，停火期至少三天。

自从反政府武装上个月底发动新一轮进攻，以及双方上周六在白俄罗斯的和平谈判破裂之后，分离分子自行宣布独立的顿涅茨克和卢甘斯克爆发了激烈战斗，特别是在乌克兰控制的城镇德巴尔切夫周围。


**EU Official Calls for Immediate Truce in Ukraine**

The European Union's foreign policy chief has called for an immediate truce in eastern Ukraine, where fresh fighting has killed three people, according to officials.

Witnesses saw at least three bodies outside a hospital that was hit by shells in the rebel-held city of Donetsk on Wednesday.

In a statement, the EU's Federica Mogherini said the "fighting, provoked by the continued separatist offensive, notably around Debaltseve, is causing great human suffering and undermines all efforts aimed at a political solution."

"The shelling of civilians, wherever it happens, is a grave violation of international humanitarian law. Artillery should immediately be withdrawn from residential areas," she continued.

Mogherini called for the establishment of a "local temporary truce for a minimum of three days, taking immediate effect."

Fighting has raged in the self-declared separatist regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, especially around the Ukrainian-controlled town of Debaltseve, since the rebels launched a new offensive late last month and peace talks in Belarus between the two sides collapsed Saturday.
