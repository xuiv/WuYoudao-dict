**欧洲高法裁决：数据保护法不足以保护隐私**

欧洲最高法院星期一做出对一名奥地利学生有利的裁决。该学生抱怨说，跨大西洋数据保护协议没有对美国社交媒体网络脸书（Facebook）使用者的隐私提供足够保护，

欧洲最高法院说，脸书在欧洲的运作中心爱尔兰的隐私权监管机构必须决定是否应当暂停将信息从欧洲传送到美国。

跨大西洋数据保护协议、既所谓的安全港协议已经实施了15年。这个协议允许美国公司在不违反欧洲隐私法的条件在美国和欧洲进行数据交换。美国四千多家公司都依照这个协议来处理跨大西洋业务。

美国国家安全局前合同工斯诺登两年前披露美国对欧洲和其他非美国公民进行非法监查。在那之后，高科技涉及的隐私一直在欧洲和美国受到关注。

European Court Says Data Protection Treaty Not Strong Enough

The highest court in Europe has ruled in favor of an Austrian student who complained that a trans-Atlantic data protection agreement does not do enough to shield the privacy of users of the U.S.-based social media network Facebook.

The court said privacy regulators in Ireland, where Facebook's European operation is based, must now decide whether the network's transfers of information from Europe to the United States should be suspended.

The Safe Harbour agreement has been in effect for 15 years, developed as a way to allow U.S. firms to exchange data with Europe without violating European privacy laws. More than 4,000 U.S. firms use the provisions in dealing with their trans-Atlantic business.

Technological privacy has been in the spotlight in both Europe and the United States since information surfaced two years ago through U.S. whistleblower Edward Snowden that the United States had been spying illegally on Europeans and other non-U.S. citizens.

**土耳其再召见俄大使抗议侵犯领空**

土耳其星期一再次召见俄罗斯驻土耳其大使，之前土耳其外交部指责俄罗斯在叙利亚边界附近两次侵犯土耳其领空。

土耳其在俄罗斯战机星期六进入其领空后召见俄罗斯大使并警告说，如再有类似事件发生，俄罗斯必须承担后果。俄罗斯战机星期日再次进入土耳其领空。

俄罗斯国防部星期一说，这是因为当地天气恶劣，没有理由寻找阴谋论。

北约秘书长斯托尔滕贝格星期二对记者说，入侵领空的行为看起来不像是意外。 他还说：“我不猜测动机，我只想重申这是对土耳其领空的严重侵犯，不应再次发生。北约已坚决表示与土耳其站在一起。”

他说，俄罗斯家加强在叙利亚的军事存在，也引起关注，俄罗斯不仅打击伊斯兰国武装分子，也攻击了其他反政府力量，造成许多平民死亡。

俄罗斯上周以来不断在叙利亚进行空袭。俄罗斯称袭击目标是伊斯兰国武装分子和恐怖组织。俄罗斯的盟友、叙利亚总统阿萨德经常把与政府交战四年多的反政府力量称为恐怖分子。

Turkey Summons Russian Ambassador on 2nd Airspace Breach

Turkey summoned Russia's ambassador for a second time Monday after what the foreign ministry said was a second instance of a Russian plane violating Turkish airspace near the Syrian border.

Turkey first lodged its protest with the Russian ambassador and warned of consequences of any future incursions after a Russian jet crossed into Turkish territory on Saturday. The foreign ministry said the second airspace violation took place on Sunday.

Russia's defense ministry said Monday that incident was the result of bad weather conditions in the area, and that there was no reason to look for conspiracy theories.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters Tuesday that the violations do not look like an accident.

"I will not speculate on the motives, I would just reiterate or restate that this is a serious violation of Turkish airspace, it should not happen again, and NATO has expressed strong solidarity with Turkey," Stoltenberg said.

He added that Russia's increased military presence in Syria raises concerns because it has attacked not only Islamic State fighters, but also other opposition groups and "many civilians have lost their lives."

Russian planes have been conducting airstrikes in Syria since last week targeting both Islamic State fighters and what it called "terrorist" groups. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, an ally of Russia, has frequently used the term "terrorist" to describe the rebels who have fought against his government for more than four years.
