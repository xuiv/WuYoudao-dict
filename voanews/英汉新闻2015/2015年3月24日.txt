**英国首相卡梅隆:不寻求第三次连任**

英国首相卡梅隆说，如果他的保守党在即将举行的议会选举中获胜，他不会寻求第三个首相任期。

在英国广播公司星期一播出的采访报道中，卡梅隆誓言如果保守党在5月10日选举后继续执政，他将作满五年首相任期，并表示他希望在任内解决教育和福利改革等问题。

但卡梅隆对电视节目主持人兰戴尔说，这就像是早餐时吃碎麦片条，两个刚刚好，第三个就太多了。(注解： 20世纪70年代末首相卡梅隆16岁时，伊顿公学早餐主食是大块碎麦片条。当时的流行广告说，你吃两个可以，三个就太多了。)

卡梅隆还说，新人和新领导将成为好事，这一刻肯定会到来，而且保守党内正在涌现出一些了不起的人物。卡梅隆提到内政大臣特里萨•梅、财政大臣奥斯本和伦敦市长约翰逊，为潜在的继任者。

British PM, Eyeing Re-Election, Rules Out Possible Third Term

British Prime Minister David Cameron says he will not seek a third term at 10 Downing Street if his Conservative Party wins the upcoming parliamentary elections.

In an interview with BBC television that aired Monday, Mr. Cameron pledged to serve a full five-year term if his party remains in government after the May 10 vote, saying he wanted to finish working on such issues as education and welfare reform.

But the prime minister told interviewer James Landale that "terms are like shredded wheat - two are wonderful, but three might just be too many."

"There definitely comes a time when a fresh pair of eyes and fresh leadership would be good, and the Conservative Party has some great people coming up," Mr. Cameron added, naming Home Secretary Theresa May, Chancellor George Osborne and London Mayor Boris Johnson as potential successors.


**美国阿富汗领导人会谈 争取改善双边关系**

阿富汗总统加尼星期二将在白宫会见美国总统奥巴马。在饱受战火蹂躏的阿富汗，人们对美国未来的军事存在仍提出各种问题。

加尼总统和首席执行官阿卜杜拉•阿卜杜拉星期一会见了包括克里国务卿在内的美国高级官员，克里称赞会谈“富有成果”。加尼和阿卜杜拉共同领导一个权力分享政府。

会谈的目的是改善双边关系。美阿两国由于近14年的战争而陷入紧张状态，而且美国与阿富汗前总统卡尔扎伊经常意见不一。

在星期一的会谈中，两国领导人谈到了加尼总统所关心的安全问题。塔利班通常在春季更频繁地发动袭击。

美国宣布，为了帮助加强阿富汗的稳定局面，将要求国会拨款，以使阿富汗国家安全部队至少在2017年之前维持35万2千人的编制。

双方还同意，阿富汗政府必须完成特定的改革并满足其他重要事项，以获得8亿美元经济援助。美国官员说，是阿富汗方面提出以刺激为基础的经援方式。

US, Afghan Leaders Meet to 'Revitalize' Relations

Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani meets U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House on Tuesday, amid questions about the future U.S. military presence in the war-torn country.

President Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah, who head a power-sharing government, met top U.S. officials on Tuesday including Secretary of State John Kerry, who praised the talks as "productive."

The discussions are aimed at improving bilateral relations that have been strained by nearly 14 years of war and America's often testy relations with former Afghan President Hamid Karzai.

During the Monday talks, the leaders addressed Mr. Ghani's concerns regarding security, ahead of the spring months that have traditionally seen more frequent than usual Taliban attacks.

To help shore up stability, the United States announced it would ask Congress for funding to allow the Afghan National Security Force to maintain the 352,000 troop level through at least fiscal year 2017.

Both sides also agreed to require the Afghan government to complete specific reforms and meet other milestones in order to receive up to $800 million in economic aid. U.S. officials said the Afghans suggested the incentive-based funding idea.
