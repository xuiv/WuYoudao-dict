**俄一架战机疑在土叙边境遭击落**

俄罗斯星期二说，一架俄罗斯Su-24战机在土耳其与叙利亚边界坠毁，并说这架战机被“地面炮火”击落。

土耳其军方官员说，这家俄罗斯战机飞入土耳其领空，无视土耳其五分钟内发出的10次要求其返回叙利亚空域的警告，随后被土耳其的F-16战机击落。

俄罗斯国防部说，这架战机一直从未飞离叙利亚领空。俄罗斯还表示，这架战机的飞行员跳伞，但目前的情况尚不清楚。来自该地区的视频显示，两名飞行员使用降落伞从空中下降。土耳其媒体说，俄罗斯直升飞机正在搜索这一地区。

克里姆林宫的一位发言人称之为“非常严重的事件”，但是说要下定论为时尚早。

美国国务院发言人说，目前还不能证实媒体有关土耳其战机击落一架国籍不明战机的报道，但正密切关注事态发展。

Russian Fighter Jet Shot Down at Turkey-Syria Border

Russia said Tuesday one of its Su-24 fighter jets was shot down along the border between Turkey and Syria, but said "firing from the ground" was responsible for downing the plane.

Turkish military officials, however, said their F-16 jets shot down the plane after it violated the country's airspace and ignored 10 warnings in the span of five minutes to leave.

Russia's defense ministry said the jet never left Syrian territory. Russia also said its pilots ejected, but that their status was unknown. Video from the area appeared to show two pilots parachuting down from the sky, and Turkey's Dogan news agency said Russian helicopters were searching the area.

A Kremlin spokesman called it a "very serious incident" but said it was too early to draw conclusions.

A U.S. State Department spokesman says they cannot confirm press reports that Turkish jets have downed a warplane of unknown origin, but are monitoring the situation closely.

Pope Urged to Press Human Rights Issues in Africa

Pope Francis begins his first official visit to Africa Wednesday, with stops planned in Kenya, Uganda, and the Central African Republic -- a trip that human rights advocates hope he will use to press for expanded political rights, religious tolerance, and respect for minorities.

The pope makes his first stop in Kenya Wednesday, where he will visit the slum of Kangemi, in keeping with his advocacy for the poor.

He is also expected to highlight the effects of climate change, having previously said the underprivileged are disproportionately affected by changes in weather patterns. And he will meet with leaders of different faiths, in an effort to address Kenya's history of violence between religious groups.

Human Rights Watch has sent a letter to the pope outlining a list of concerns the group hopes he will address during his African visit. It called for the pope to address human rights violations in all three of his destinations.
