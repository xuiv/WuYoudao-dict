US Concerned Over Arrest of Maldivian Ex-President

The United States has expressed concern over the arrest of former Maldives president Mohamed Nasheed, who faces charges under anti-terrorism laws in the Indian Ocean country.

Mr. Nasheed was arrested at his home Sunday in the capital, Male, and accused of illegally detaining a senior judge more than three years ago during his presidency.

On Monday, police dragged Mr. Nasheed into a courtroom to hear the charges. He later appeared to be in pain and complained that he had been abused by police.

The top U.S. diplomat for South Asia, Nisha Biswal, met with the Maldivian foreign minister to voice concern over the situation.

"She urged the government to take steps to restore confidence in their commitment to democracy, judicial independence, and rule of law, including respect for the rights of peaceful protest and respect for due process," State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.

India's foreign ministry also expressed concern over "the arrest and manhandling" of Mr. Nasheed, saying political parties should resolve their differences within the Maldives' constitutional and legal framework.


**希腊向欧洲债权方提交经改方案**

希腊向其欧洲债权方提交了经济改革具体方案，作为将救助计划延期四个月的协议的部分内容。

欧洲委员会发言人希纳斯星期二在推特上说，“及时收到”希腊政府提交的改革措施方案。

希纳斯没有透露其他细节。但路透社援引一名接近欧委会的消息人士的话说，经改方案很全面，足以成为一个有效的起点。

希腊错过了在最后期限星期一向欧洲各国财长提交经济改革方案。希腊要通过经改方案说服债权方将救助计划延长四个月。

19个欧元区国家的财长计划星期二审议希腊的经改方案。

经改方案旨在重振希腊经济及削减政府开支，作为交换条件，债权方将延长总额为2700多亿美元的贷款。这一贷计划将于本周期满。

希腊在制定经改方案时拥有一定自由度，但方案内容必须得到欧洲领导人、欧洲中央银行以及国际货币基金组织的认可。

Greece Proposes Reforms to Extend Bailout

Greece has presented a list of proposed economic reforms to its European creditors, as part of a deal to extend its massive bailout for four months.

European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said via Twitter on Tuesday the Greek government's list of reform measures was received "on time."

He gave no other details. But Reuters news agency quoted a source close to the Commission as saying the list is "sufficiently comprehensive to be a valid starting point."

Debt-riddled Greece on Monday slid past a deadline imposed by European finance ministers to present proposals that would convince the country's creditors to grant the four-month extension.

The 19 European finance ministers in the euro currency bloc are planning to consider the Greek plan Tuesday.

The proposals are aimed at reviving the country's faltering economy and cutting government spending in exchange for renewing the more than $270 billion in loans that are set to expire this week.

Greece has some voice in setting the reforms it wants to make in order to keep its bailout, but the terms must be approved by its European lenders, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
