Scandal-Hit Malaysian PM Reshuffles Cabinet

Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, who is under increasing pressure because of serious fraud allegations, has fired his deputy and attorney general.

In a televised address Tuesday, Mr. Najib announced the dismissal of Deputy Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, who had been one of his fiercest critics.

Earlier, a government statement said Attorney General Abdul Gani Patail was terminated because of "health reasons."

Patail had helped lead an investigation into whether the prime minister received over $700 million from the government-owned 1MBD investment fund.

Mr. Najib has denied any wrongdoing and has suggested that the corruption allegations are part of a "political sabotage" against Malaysia's longtime ruling coalition.

Obama: Africa’s Progress Dependent on Development, Democracy

In his farewell speech capping a historic trip to Kenya and Ethiopia, U.S. President Barack Obama hailed Africa's extraordinary progress, while noting that such progress can only be sustained through continued development and democracy for all.

While not naming China, Mr. Obama emphasized what sets the United States apart in its investment in Africa. “Economic relationships cannot simply be about other countries building infrastructure with foreign labor or extracting Africa’s natural resources. Real economic partnerships have to be a good deal for Africa—they have to create jobs and capacity for Africans. That’s the kind of partnership America offers,” he said.

The White House announced the United States intends to provide at least $40 million in assistance related to countering violent extremism in East Africa.

Obama told reporters Monday Ethiopia has played a vital role in fighting the Somali militant group Al-Shabab.
