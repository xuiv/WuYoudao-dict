**奥巴马将会见突尼斯总统埃塞卜西**

美国总统奥巴马星期四将在白宫会见突尼斯总统埃塞卜西，以此强调华盛顿支持突尼斯实行民主过渡。

突尼斯去年12月举行具有历史意义的选举后，埃塞卜西就任总统。

美国官员说，两位总统将讨论增加美国对突尼斯的军事及经济援助。目前突尼斯正在应对大批年轻人失业以及地区动乱威胁等问题。

在2011年爆发的民主抗议活动中，长期执政的突尼斯总统本·阿里被赶下台。突尼斯的民主运动在北非和中东引发了阿拉伯之春运动。

此后，突尼斯举行了几次成功的选举，尽管发生了暴力事件，突尼斯的世俗党派和伊斯兰政党基本上避免了其他阿拉伯之春国家所经历的动乱。

Obama to Host Tunisia President at White House

U.S. President Barack Obama meets at the White House Thursday with Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi to help underscore Washington's support for the country's democratic transition.

President Essebsi came to power following historic elections in December.

U.S. officials say the presidents will discuss increasing U.S. military and economic aid to Tunisia, which is dealing with massive youth unemployment and the threat of regional instability.

Long-time president Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali was ousted by democratic protests in 2011 that inspired the Arab Spring uprisings across North Africa and the Middle East.

The country has since held several successful elections, and despite bouts of violence, the country's secular and Islamist parties have largely avoided the turmoil that spread through other Arab Spring countries.


**CNN：中国警告飞越南中国海填岛的美国侦察机**

CNN报道中国海军向飞越人造岛礁的一架美国侦察机发出八次警告。在有争议的南中国海，北京利用这些人造岛礁维护其领土要求。

据美国有线电视新闻网(CNN)报道，一个声音用英语喊话：“这是中国海军，这是中国海军，请立即飞离。”星期三，美国有线电视新闻网的记者获准在这架美国P8-A海神侦察机上进行采访报道。

美国有线电视新闻网说，美国海军这架最先进的侦察机在4500米的高度飞越斯普拉特利群岛中的这些有争议的岛礁，该海域距离中国海岸将近1000公里。

美国官员对中国在斯普拉特利群岛七处地点的填海造岛活动表示越来越多的关注。菲律宾、越南、马来西亚、文莱和台湾也宣称对该群岛的某些岛屿拥有主权。

CNN: China Issues Warnings to US Spy Plane

China's navy is reported to have issued eight warning messages to a U.S. military surveillance plane that passed over a group of man-made islands Beijing is using to secure its sweeping territorial claims in the disputed South China Sea.

"This is the Chinese navy, this is the Chinese navy, please go away quickly," said in a voice in English, according to a report by CNN, whose reporters were allowed to fly on the U.S. P8-A Poseidon spy plane on Wednesday.

CNN says the U.S. Navy's most advanced spy aircraft passed as low as 4,500 meters over the disputed reefs and shoals in the Spratly Islands, which are nearly 1,000 kilometers from the shores of mainland China.

U.S. officials have expressed increasing concern about China's land-reclamation efforts at seven sites in the Spratly, parts of which are also claimed by the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan.
