**自由之家报告**

国际人权组织自由之家星期三说，在民主理念基础上建立一个国际体系的前景面临着四分之一世纪以来的最大威胁。

自由之家在星期三发表的年度报告中说，2014年的民主体制处于“特别恶劣”的状态。在刚刚发表的年度报告中，叙利亚被列为民主程度最差的国家。在世界范围内，民主自由事业有所倒退。

自由之家说，突尼斯是一个值得注意的例外。自黎巴嫩40年前爆发内战以来，突尼斯2014年成为第一个赢得自由的阿拉伯国家。

星期三发表的报告说，“数目多得令人不安”的经济强国和具有地区影响力的国家在民主方面开倒车，言论自由受到威胁，其形式包括国家监视、互联网限制以及限制个人在教育、就业和旅行等方面自由做出决定。俄罗斯、委内瑞拉、埃及、土耳其、泰国、尼日利亚、肯尼亚、阿塞拜疆和匈牙利被列为在民主自由方面倒退的国家。

自由之家说，更令人不安的是，民主标准遭到更明目张胆的弃绝。俄罗斯对乌克兰的入侵，“包括对克里米亚的公然攫取和正式吞并”被视为“突出的例子”。

自由之家还表示，中国国家主席习近平在海上领土争议上变得更加嘟嘟逼人。另外，习近平打击腐败的范围已经深入到共产党内部。但该报告称，反腐调查忽略了正当的法律程序。

自由之家指出，委内瑞拉、肯尼亚和中国等国政府利用反恐法律压制异议人士。

FREEDOM HOUSE REPORT

The international rights group Freedom House said Wednesday that the prospect of an international system built on democratic ideals is under greater threat now than at any point in the past quarter-century.

Freedom House said in its annual roundup Wednesday that the state of democracy in 2014 was "exceptionally grim." Syria ranked the lowest in the just released annual report, but the group recorded more declines than gains in democratic freedoms around the world.

Freedom House said the one notable exception is Tunisia, which in 2014 became the first Arab country to achieve the status of "free" since Lebanon's civil war four decades ago.

A "troubling number" of economic powers and regionally influential nations slid backwards in their democratic standards, according to Wednesday's report. Dangers to freedom of expression were said to come from state surveillance, Internet restrictions, and curbs on the freedom to make individual decisions on things like education, employment, and travel. Russia, Venezuela, Egypt, Turkey, Thailand, Nigeria, Kenya, Azerbaijan, and Hungary were among the nations noted for such declines.

More troubling, Freedom House said, are more explicit rejections of democratic standards, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, "including the outright seizure and formal annexation of Crimea," which it noted as a "prime example."

Freedom House also said Chinese President Xi Jinping has grown more aggressive about defending disputed maritime territory, and as his anti-corruption sweep has reached deeply into the Communist party, the report says the probe has ignored the principles of due process.

Freedom House said governments such as Venezuela, Kenya, and China, have invoked terrorism laws to silence dissent.

**预计金正恩5月访问俄罗斯**

朝鲜深居简出的领导人金正恩看来将于5月前往俄罗斯。自2011年接替他去世的父亲的职位以来，这将是他首次出访。

韩联社星期三证实，朝鲜接受邀请，准备派团参加苏联在二战中战胜德国70周年纪念活动，而金正恩将是朝鲜代表团成员。

韩联社援引俄罗斯政府的话说，“大约20位国家领导人已确定出席，朝鲜领导人也在其中。”

如果金正恩参加纪念活动，这将是他自掌权以来首次出国出访。但平壤也可能派朝鲜名义上的国家元首金永南前往俄罗斯。

中国也可能是金正恩首次正式出访的国家，但自金正恩从去世的父亲手中接掌权力以来，朝鲜与这个最强有力的盟友之间的关系趋于紧张。

中国和俄罗斯都签署了联合国协议，就朝鲜继续发展核武器对其进行惩罚，但中国采取了更强硬的立场。

2013年3月，美国和中国联合起草的制裁方案在安理会获得通过。俄罗斯是安理会常任理事国。

North Korean Leader Expected to Visit Russia in May

North Korea's reclusive leader Kim Jong Un looks set to travel to Russia in May for his first foreign visit since succeeding his late father in office in 2011.

The South Korean news service Yonhap confirmed Wednesday Mr. Kim is among the North Korean delegation accepting an invitation to ceremonies marking the 70th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Germany in World War II.

Yonhap quoted the Russian government as saying "about 20 state leaders have confirmed their attendance, and the North Korean leader is among them."

If Mr. Kim does attend, it will be his first foreign visit since taking office. But Pyongyang could instead send Kim Yong Nam, North Korea's nominal head of state.

China was also a likely candidate for Kim Jong Un's first official foreign visit, but relations with North Korea's strongest ally have grown more tense since he took over from his father Kim Jong Il.

Both China and Russia have signed United Nations agreements punishing North Korea for continuing its nuclear arms development, but China has taken the stronger stance.

Sanctions drafted jointly by the United States and China were approved by the Security Council in March 2013. Russia is a permanent member of the Security Council.
