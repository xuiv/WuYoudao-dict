**也门各交战派系前往参加和平谈判**

也门各交战派系正在前往日内瓦参加和平谈判途中。这是就这个中东国家长达几个月的冲突举行的首次重大和平会谈。

星期一的谈判由联合国促成，将使也门什叶派胡塞反政府武装和正在流亡的哈迪总统做到谈判桌前。

胡塞武装今年2月夺取了也门政府的控制权，迫使哈迪总统逃到沙特首都利雅得。

负责安全事务的官员说，沙特领导的针对反政府武装及其同盟的空袭还在也门的几个省持续进行。这些官员不愿透露姓名，因为他们没有权限向通报记者这些情况。

与此同时，成千上万名胡塞武装的支持者在萨那举行游行，抗议战争，抗议他们所称的对萨那城的围困。


Yemeni Factions Head for Peace Talks

Yemen's warring factions are on their way to Geneva for the first significant talks in the Middle East country’s months-long conflict.

The talks on Monday, facilitated by the United Nations, will bring to the table Yemen’s Shi'ite Houthi rebels and the exiled government of President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi.

The Houthis wrested control of Yemen’s government in February, leading Mr. Hadi to flee to Riyadh, the Saudi capital.

Security officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief journalists, said that Saudi-led airstrikes against the rebels and their allies continued in several Yemeni provinces

Meanwhile, thousands of Houthi supporters marched in Sana'a in protest of the war and what they described as the siege of the city.

**库尔德围攻伊斯兰国占领的叙利亚城镇**

库尔德民兵正在围攻伊斯兰国组织在靠近土耳其边界的叙利亚境内所占领的一个重镇。

收复塔尔艾卜耶德将能切断伊斯兰国战斗人员的运输和补给路线。

由于预计库尔德人和激进分子之间将爆发激战，成千上万叙利亚人已经逃离那个地区。

星期天，这些叙利亚人得以跨境进入土耳其，但在此之前，他们遭到一些土耳其军人的拦阻。一名记者说，几名军人让难民跨境进入土耳其；但另一名记者说，他看到人们穿过边境栅栏进入土耳其。

战事已迫使100多万叙利亚难民涌入土耳其。土耳其总统埃尔多安担心难民危机可能会恶化。

他星期天还说，他担心，两个库尔德组织 - 民主联盟党以及被视为非法团体的库尔德工人党 - 会在土耳其与叙利亚的交界地带做大得势。

库尔德人长期以来一直在打游击战，对抗土耳其政府，谋求建立独立的库尔德国家。埃尔多安认为，美国领导的联军在叙利亚境内的空袭会为库尔德人开辟疆土。

也是在星期天，叙利亚城市霍姆斯两个政府控制的社区发生汽车炸弹袭击，造成27人受伤。目前还没有人声称对袭击负责。

霍姆斯是四年前发生试图推翻叙利亚总统阿萨德暴动的城市之一，也经常是炸弹袭击的目标城市。

Kurds Close In on Islamic State-Held Town in Syria

Kurdish militias are closing in on an important Islamic State-held town in Syria near the Turkish border.

Retaking Tal Abyad could cut off a transit and supply route for Islamic State fighters.

Thousands of Syrian civilians have fled the area, anticipating fierce fighting between the Kurds and the militants.

Syrians managed to cross into Turkey Sunday after some Turkish soldiers kept them from entering. One reporter said several soldiers let the refugees cross while another journalist said he saw people cutting through a fence.

Fighting has driven more than a million Syrian refugees into Turkey and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is worried the refugee crisis could worsen.

He also said Sunday he is concerned that two Kurdish groups - the Democratic Union Party and the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party - could gain ground along Turkey's border with Syria.

Kurds have long fought a guerilla war against Turkey for an independent Kurdish state. Mr. Erdogan believes U.S.-led coalition airstrikes along just inside Syria could carve out territory for the Kurds.

Also in Syria Sunday, car bombs wounded 27 people in two government-controlled neighborhoods in the city of Homs. No one has claimed responsibility.

Homs is one of the cities where the uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad began four years ago and has been a frequent target of bombings.
