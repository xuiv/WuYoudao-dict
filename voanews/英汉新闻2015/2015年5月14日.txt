**印度总理莫迪访华寻求更紧密关系**

印度总理莫迪对中国进行国事访问，预计此行将进一步促进这两个亚洲大国之间的外交和经贸关系。

莫迪星期四早上抵达中国陕西省省会西安。陕西是中国国家主席习近平的家乡。去年当选印度总理后，这是莫迪首次访问中国。

星期四晚些时候，习近平前往西安欢迎莫迪，此举被视为善意的表示。中国领导人通常不在首都北京之外的地方会见到访的外国领导人。

几个月前，莫迪在家乡艾哈迈达巴德招待了对印度进行国事访问的习近平，双方在那次访问中突显出对彼此的热情，并希望这种个人之间的友情有助于扩大双边经济合作。

据中国国营媒体《环球时报》报道，预计两国领导人在莫迪访华期间将签署总额为100亿美元的经济协议。

India's Modi To Seek Closer Ties During China Visit

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in China for a state visit expected to further boost diplomatic and economic ties between the two Asian giants.

Prime Minister Modi, who is making his first visit to China since being elected last year, arrived early Thursday in Xi'an, the capital of Shaanxi province and the hometown of Chinese President Xi Jinping.

In what is being seen as a gesture of goodwill, President Xi is traveling to Xi'an to welcome Mr. Modi later Thursday. It is unusual for Chinese leaders to meet visiting heads of state outside of the capital, Beijing.

The visit comes months after Mr. Modi hosted Mr. Xi at his hometown of Ahmedabad for a state visit during which both leaders exuded a notable degree of personal warmth, which both sides hope translates into further economic cooperation.

The two leaders are expected during the visit to sign $10 billion in economic deals, according to the Chinese state-run Global Times newspaper.

星期四，美国总统奥巴马和海湾六国高级官员将继续举行峰会，讨论中东问题，包括潜在的伊朗核协议以及伊拉克、叙利亚、也门和利比亚的武装冲突。

在星期三举行的白宫工作晚宴上，奥巴马开始与海湾合作委员会成员国高级官员展开会谈，星期四的会谈将转至位于华盛顿以北约100公里的总统度假地戴维营。

奥巴马说，这次会议召开之际，海湾地区正面临一个“非常具有挑战性的时刻”。

奥巴马的副国家安全顾问罗德斯星期三说，此次峰会的目的之一评估海湾国家的军事能力及它们之间以及和美国的合作方式。

海湾国家对目前美国与海湾国家区域对手伊朗进行核谈判表示担忧，并希望提升与美国的安全关系。这些国家担心核协议将提高伊朗在本地区的声望，同时削弱美国与其他海湾国家的关系，尤其是在军事领域的关系。

白宫发言人欧内斯特星期三说，美国很看重与海湾合作委员会的安全关系。

Obama Hosting Gulf Summit with Focus on Iran, Regional Conflicts

U.S. President Barack Obama and senior officials from six Gulf nations are continuing their summit Thursday on issues in the Middle East, including a potential nuclear deal with Iran and the fighting in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Libya.

The talks with the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council began with a working dinner Wednesday night at the White House before shifting Thursday to the Camp David presidential retreat about 100 kilometers north of Washington.

Mr. Obama said the meetings come during what he called a "very challenging time" in the Gulf region.

His deputy national security advisor, Ben Rhodes, told Alhurra on Wednesday that one of the goals of the summit is to examine military capabilities and ways for the Gulf countries to both work together and with the United States.

Gulf states have expressed concern about the ongoing nuclear negotiations with regional rival Iran and want to upgrade their security relationship with the U.S. They are worried that a deal would boost Iranian prestige in the region and weaken U.S. ties with other Gulf states, particularly in military matters.

White House spokesman John Earnest said Wednesday the U.S. values its security ties with the Gulf Cooperation Council.
