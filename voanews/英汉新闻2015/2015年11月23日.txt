**美特种部队将“很快”进入叙利亚**

美国官员说，美国特种部队将“很快”进入叙利亚北部地区，帮助协调当地武装人员和美国领导的打击伊斯兰国激进分子的行动。

美国副助理国务卿布雷特·麦格克星期天在哥伦比亚广播公司（CBS）的 “面对国家”节目中说，美国部队即将进入叙利亚，不过美国不会具体指明行动的日期。

美国总统奥巴马上个月授权50名特种部队军人执行这一任务，包括与当地的叙利亚武装、以及阿拉伯、库尔德和土库曼武装采取联合行动。

麦克格副助理国务卿说，美国现在与伊斯兰国组织处于交战状态，整个国际社会也需要这样做。

有人批评说，美国在打击伊拉克和叙利亚的激进分子时行动过于迟缓。麦克格回应说，最近已经加强了打击力度和速度。他说，即将开始的针对伊斯兰国在叙利亚总部拉卡的行动在六个月之前是不可能进行。

US Special Forces Going Into Syria 'Very Soon'

A U.S. official says American special forces will go into northern Syria "very soon" on their mission to help coordinate local fighters and the efforts of a U.S.-led coalition targeting Islamic State militants.

Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Brett McGurk said Sunday during an appearance on CBS television's "Face the Nation" that while the troops are going into Syria, the U.S. will not say exactly when that will happen.

President Barack Obama last month authorized up to 50 troops for the mission that will involve working with local Syrian forces, Arabs, Kurds and Turkmen fighters.

McGurk said the United States is at war with the Islamic State group and that the entire international community needs to be as well.

He also responded to criticism that the U.S. has been moving too slowly to confront the militants in Iraq and Syria, saying efforts have recently accelerated and that the coming push toward the Islamic State de facto capital in Raqqa, Syria could not have happened six months ago.

**以色列称两巴勒斯坦妇女持剪刀行凶**

以色列当局说，星期一在耶路撒冷中部的一个集市发生巴勒斯坦人持刀行凶事件。一天前，约旦河西岸以色列控制区发生了一系列袭击事件。

警方说，在周一的袭击中，两名妇女用剪刀袭击一名男子后被警察击毙。

军方说，星期天，一名巴勒斯坦人持刀多次捅向一名21岁女子的头部和胸部，后来被附近的士兵开枪击毙。

以色列军方说，在先前发生的一起袭击事件中，一名妇女在一个军事基地的入口处拔出匕首刺向平民。约旦河西岸的一位定居者说，他把车开离道路撞向这位妇女。之后，一个士兵开枪将这名妇女击毙。

连续八周街头暴力的不断升级，不仅给以色列的安全系统构成挑战，同时也引发美国关注。克里国务卿定于本周访问这个地区。

Israel: Palestinian Women Stabbed Man With Scissors

Israeli authorities reported a Palestinian stabbing attack Monday near a market in central Jerusalem, a day after a series of incidents in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.

Police said Monday's attack involved two women with scissors stabbing a man before they were shot by a police officer.

On Sunday, the military said a Palestinian stabbed a 21-year-old woman multiple times in the head and chest before nearby soldiers shot him dead.

In an earlier attack, the military said a woman pulled out a knife at a military base entrance and began approaching civilians. A local West Bank settler said he veered his vehicle off the road and struck the woman. A soldier then fired at her and killed her.

The eight week surge in street violence has challenged Israel's security system and alarmed the United States, whose Secretary of State John Kerry is due to visit the region this week.
