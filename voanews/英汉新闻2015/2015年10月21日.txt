**瑞安就担任美国众议院议长一事表态**

具有影响力的美国国会众议员保罗·瑞安说，如能得到共和党内所有各派的支持，他就愿担任众议院议长职务。目前共和党内部存在严重分歧。

瑞安星期二在国会山与共和党领导人举行会谈后对记者说，他要求本党同僚在星期五之前就他提出的几个条件做出决定。

此前，瑞安曾屡次表示对担任众议院议长不感兴趣。

本月早些时候，时任众议院议长贝纳被迫离职，此后这个职位一直空缺。

瑞安被视为唯一能获得共和党内各派支持的众议院议长人选。

现年45岁的瑞安有三个子女，他每星期都要离开华盛顿，与家人共度周末，这也是他向共和党提出的条件之一。其他条件还包括“家庭责任放在首位”。

Paul Ryan Will Run For House Speaker, If GOP Unites

Influential U.S. Congressman Paul Ryan says he will run for speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, but only if he has the support of all factions within the badly splintered Republican Party.

Speaking Tuesday after meeting privately with Republican leaders at the U.S. Capitol, Ryan told reporters he is giving his colleagues until Friday to make a decision on his list of demands.

Ryan, who serves as the chairman of the House's main tax-writing committee, has repeatedly said he is not interested in serving as speaker.

The position came open earlier this month after current speaker, Congressman John Boehner, was forced out by the Freedom Caucus.

Ryan is seen as one of the only candidates who could draw support from disparate elements within the party.

The 45-year-old congressman and father of three, who leaves Washington every week to spend time with his family, also laid out several other requirements, including a stipulation that his "family commitments come first."


**伊拉克将任命一位协调打击伊斯兰国行动的指挥官**

伊拉克领导人星期三将开始挑选一名指挥官，他将成为组织各派武装打击伊斯兰国激进分子的核心人物。

美国参谋长联席会议主席邓福德星期二在访问伊拉克期间说，美国领导的联军需要一位在地面行动中拥有权威的伊拉克指挥官，以便更有效地提供支援。

在联军对伊斯兰国目标发动空袭之际，伊拉克军队、什叶派民兵、逊尼派部落民以及库尔德武装在伊拉克不同地区各自与激进分子交战，取得了不同程度的成功。总的来说，伊斯兰国仍然控制着一年多前夺取的大部分地区。

邓福德表示，他不想把伊拉克目前的局势形容为某种僵局，但也不想讨论打击伊斯兰国行动的具体时间安排。

Iraqi Leaders Discussing Single Commander to Coordinate Battle Against IS

Iraqi leaders will begin a process Wednesday to select a commander who can serve as a central figure to better organize the various forces fighting Islamic State militants.

U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman General Joseph Dunford said during Tuesday during a visit to Iraq that the U.S.-led coalition needs one person who can speak with authority on the ground campaign in order to provide better support.

While the coalition has been carrying out airstrikes, a collection of fighters from Iraq's army, Shi'ite militias, Sunni tribesman and Kurdish forces have all been battling the militants in various parts of Iraq with different levels of success. Overall, the Islamic State group has held onto much of the territory it seized more than a year ago.

Dunford said he would not describe the situation in Iraq as a stalemate and would not be discussing specific timelines for the campaign.
