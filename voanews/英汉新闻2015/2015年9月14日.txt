Okinawa Governor to Revoke Permits for New US Base

The governor of Japan's southern island of Okinawa says he will revoke permits for the construction on a new U.S. air base on his island, after talks broke down between his administration and officials in Tokyo.

Takeshi Onaga told reporters Monday that his government was taking the action after discovering "defects" in the original permits issued by his predecessor. His decision was announced just days after work resumed at the site near the remote coastal village called Henoko. The construction had been suspended for a month to allow for the negotiations.

Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters Monday that work on the new base on Henoko will continue despite Governor Onaga's decision. ((:38))

Egyptian Forces Kill 2 Mexican Tourists

Egyptian security forces have killed 12 people, including Mexican tourists, after mistakenly opening fire on the visitors while the forces were pursuing terrorists in Egypt's western desert.

The Mexican Foreign Ministry said at least two of the dead were Mexican nationals.

Egypt said in a statement the dead were Mexican and Egyptian, but did not break down the death toll by nationalities.

The statement also said the area the tourists were in was "off limits to foreign tourists."

Rasha Azazi, a spokesperson for the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism, said the involved tour company did not have the proper permits and did not inform authorities that the tourists would be in the Farafra area. Azazi told the Associated Press that all trips to Farafra have to be cleared by authorities.

Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto has demanded an investigation into the deadly incident.
