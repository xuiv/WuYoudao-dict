**国际法院：塞族和克族均未犯种族灭绝罪**

国际刑事法院星期二对塞尔维亚人和克罗地亚人据称在20世纪90年代巴尔干战争中犯有暴行的起诉做出裁决说， 双方都没有犯下种族灭绝罪行。克罗地亚在那次冲突中脱离南斯拉夫而独立。

国际刑事法院法官彼得•汤姆卡宣布说，两国军队犯有诸多罪行，但双方都未能证实对方犯有种族灭绝罪。克罗地亚冲突造成2万多人死亡。

克罗地亚指控塞尔维亚人1991年在武科瓦尔市等地进行种族屠杀。塞尔维亚人后来指控克罗地亚人1995年将塞族人赶出克罗地亚。

目前双方都表示接受为解决国家间争执而设立的国际刑事法院的裁决，但也有人担心这项裁决可能会引发政治紧张局势。
The top U.N. court ruled Tuesday that neither Croatia nor Serbia committed genocide during the 1990s Balkan wars, when Croatia broke away from Yugoslavia.

According to a ruling read by Judge Peter Tomka of the International Court of Justice, many crimes had been committed by the two countries' forces but both sides failed to prove the other committed genocide during the conflict, which killed over 20,000 people.

Croatia accused Serbia of committing ethnic cleansing and genocide in the city of Vukovar and other areas in 1991. Serbia later filed a counter suit over the expulsion of Serbs from Croatia in 1995.

Both countries have said they will accept the ruling of the ICJ, which is meant to settle disputes between states. But there is concern that the ruling may spark political tensions.


**乌克兰东部再起战火5人丧生**

官方报道说，在新的一轮对抗中，乌克兰军队和俄罗斯支持的分离分子武装在顿涅茨克相互炮击，打死至少5人。

分离分子武装控制的顿涅茨克的市政厅官员说，24小时的激烈炮击还造成至少13人受伤。

自从上周六乌克兰政府和分离分子在白俄罗斯的和平谈判破裂之后，自行宣布独立的顿涅茨克和卢甘斯克爆发了激烈战斗，特别是在乌克兰控制的城镇德巴尔切夫周围。

人们担心暴力还会升级。一名亲俄罗斯分离主义领袖星期一宣布“总动员”，目标是将反政府武装扩大到10万人。

与此同时，美国表示还没有决定是否向乌克兰提供杀伤性武器，帮助乌克兰打击分离主义分子。

Fresh Fighting in Eastern Ukraine Kills Five

Fresh fighting between Ukraine's military and Russia-backed separatists killed at least five people in the region of Donetsk, officials said Tuesday.

Officials at the rebel-run Donetsk city hall also said at least 13 people were wounded in the fierce outbreak of shelling over the previous 24 hours.

Fighting has raged in the self-declared separatist regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, especially around the Ukrainian-controlled town of Debaltseve, since peace talks in Belarus between Ukraine's government and the separatists collapsed Saturday.

There are fears the violence could soon escalate. On Monday, a pro-Russian separatist leader announced a "general mobilization" with the aim of bolstering separatist armed forces to as many as 100,000 fighters.

Meanwhile, the United States says it has not made a decision on whether to provide Ukraine with lethal military assistance in its fight against the separatists.
