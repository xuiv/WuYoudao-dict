Veteran CBS News Journalist Killed in New York Car Crash

Award-winning CBS News correspondent Bob Simon, who covered many of the world's major conflict zones over a five-decade career, was killed Wednesday night in a car crash in New York City. He was 73 years old.

Authorities say Simon was a passenger in a car that struck another vehicle, then veered into metal barriers separating traffic lanes.

Simon joined CBS News in 1967, covering campus demonstrations and inner city riots. His time as a war correspondent began in 1971, when he was sent to Saigon at the height of the Vietnam War, and was on one of the last helicopters to leave the besieged city as the U.S. withdrew in 1975.

Simon spent 20 years as CBS News' chief Middle East correspondent beginning in 1987. He and three of his colleagues were captured by Iraqi forces at the start of the Persian Gulf War in January 1991, and spent 40 days in captivity. He also covered conflicts in Northern Ireland, Yugoslavia and Portugal.

He later became a regular correspondent for the network's news magazine show "60 Minutes" and its short-lived spinoff, "60 Minutes II." Simon won numerous prestigious journalism awards during his career, including 27 Emmys.

**乌克兰冲突峰会达成停火协议**

乌克兰、俄罗斯、德国和法国的领导人星期四在白俄罗斯结束了马拉松式的谈判，宣布达成一项停火协议，以结束乌克兰东部持续数月、导致数千人死亡的战斗。

经过连续进行16个小时通宵达旦的艰苦会谈之后，领导人在白俄罗斯首都明斯克宣布停火将于2月15号生效。

俄罗斯总统普京说，各方就主要问题达成了一致，其中包括从冲突地区撤出重型武器。

据报道，亲俄反叛武装也接受了这个协议。

但所有各方在各自举行的记者会上都强调，分歧依然存在。德国首相默克尔说：“我们不抱任何幻想。还有很多很多工作要做。”

就在星期四宣布达成停火协议的同时，乌克兰军事官员说，夜间有更多的俄罗斯坦克和重型武器越境进入了乌克兰领土。

基辅军方发言人说：“大约50辆坦克、40部多管火箭发射系统和相同数量的装甲车在伊斯瓦林穿越乌俄边界。”

俄罗斯否认派军队和武器跨越边界，帮助亲俄分离分子与乌克兰军队作战。乌克兰东部冲突迄今已造成至少5400丧生，数千人受伤。

Cease-fire Deal Reached for Eastern Ukraine

The leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France emerged from marathon talks in Belarus Thursday with a cease-fire deal aimed at ending months of fighting that has killed thousands in eastern Ukraine.

The cease-fire, which will begin February 15, was announced following 16 hours of grueling, all-night talks in the Belarussian capital, Minsk.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said the parties "have managed to agree on the main issues," including the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the conflict area.

Pro-Russian rebels were also reported to have accepted the deal.

But all sides also stressed, in separate news conferences, that disagreements remain. "We have no illusions," said German Chancellor Angela Merkel, adding there is "very, very much work to be done."

Even as the cease-fire was unveiled Thursday, Ukrainian military officials said that more tanks and heavy weapons had crossed into Ukrainian territory from Russia overnight.

"Around 50 tanks, 40 multiple rocket launch systems, and a similar number of armored vehicles crossed the Ukrainian-Russian border at Izvarin," said Kyiv military spokesman Andriy Lysenko.

Russia has denied sending troops or weapons across the border to aid in the fighting between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian forces that has killed at least 5,400 people and wounded thousands more.
