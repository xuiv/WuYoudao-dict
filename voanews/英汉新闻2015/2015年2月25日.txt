**孟加拉国法院下令逮捕前总理齐亚**

孟加拉国一家法院星期三由于前总理齐亚未能到庭发出了对她的逮捕令。卡莉达·齐亚涉嫌与两起腐败案有关。

齐亚的律师说，由于目前孟加拉国局势动荡，齐亚担心自己的安全，她一直驻守在办公室。

齐亚被控非法为一个慈善组织购买土地，而这家慈善组织是以她已故的丈夫、前总统拉赫曼命名。

齐亚曾说，对她的指控是出于政治动机。上个月，齐亚的政党抵制了议会选举。她呼吁支持者在全国范围内阻塞交通，争取推翻现任总理哈西娜。

孟加拉国两个主要政党之间的紧张关系引发抗议和暴力，已造成约100人死亡。

Bangladesh Orders Arrest of Former PM Zia

A court in Bangladesh issued an arrest warrant Wednesday for former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia in connection with two corruption cases after she failed to appear in court.

Her lawyers argued she was concerned about safety due to ongoing unrest in Bangladesh, and that she has been confined to her office.

Ms. Zia has been charged with illegally buying land for a charity named after her late husband, former President Ziaur Rahman.

She has said the charges are politically motivated. Her party boycotted parliamentary elections last month, and she has called on her supporters to enforce a nationwide transportation ban as part of an effort to topple current Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.

The tensions between the two main parties in Bangladesh led to protests and violence that has killed about 100 people.


**国际特赦: 2014年是灾难性的一年**

人权观察组织国际特赦在年度报告中说，对世界各地的千百万人而言，2014年是“灾难性”的一年。

国际特赦的年度报告说，从叙利亚到乌克兰，从加沙地带到尼日利亚，数百万平民遭到杀戮。与此同时，世界各地去年流离失所的人超过了5千万。这是二战结束以来的第一次。

国际特赦组织星期三说，很多国家的政府未能保护平民免遭来自国家和武装组织的暴力。

国际特赦组织秘书长谢迪说：“我们在报告中要阐明的要点是，国际社会以及那些有潜力制止事态发展的人反应淡漠，事实上令人可悲。我们明确地指出，整个世界如何才能够逆转局面，提高对平民应有的保护。”

国际特赦的报告说，武装组织2014年在至少35个国家侵犯人权，伊斯兰国激进组织的兴起尤其令人担忧。

报告指出，伊斯兰国组织犯下多种战争罪行，包括针对少数群体的大规模杀戮和绑架，并对数以百计的妇女和女孩进行性侵犯。

国际特赦组织特别批评了联合国安理会，说5个常任理事国英国、中国、法国、俄罗斯和美国不断滥用否决权，将本国的政治利益或地缘政治利益置于保护平民利益之上。

国际特赦组织呼吁五个安理会常任理事国在事关种族灭绝和其他大规模杀戮时不要行使否决权。

Amnesty International: 2014 Was a Catastrophic Year for Millions

The year 2014 was a "catastrophic" one for millions of people around the world, a human rights watchdog group said Wednesday.

In its annual human rights report, Amnesty International said millions of civilians were killed from Syria to Ukraine, Gaza to Nigeria, while the number of displaced people around the world exceeded 50 million last year for the first time since the end of World War II.

The report accused world governments of failing to protect civilians from violence by states and armed groups.

Shetty, Secretary-General, Amnesty International said:"The main point that we are making in our report is that the response from the international community and those who could potentially stop this from continuing has been dismal, in fact shameful. And we are making some clear calls on what the world can do to reverse the situation and improve the protection that civilians deserve.''

Amnesty said armed groups committed abuses in at least 35 countries in 2014, and called the rise of the Islamic State militant group a particular concern.

The report accused Islamic State of committing widescale war crimes, including mass summary killings and abductions that targeted minorities, and subjecting hundreds of women and girls to sexual abuse.

Amnesty singled out the United Nations Security Council for criticism, saying the five permanent council members - Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States - "consistently abused" their veto right to "promote their political self-interest" above that of protecting civilians.

The group is urging the five states to give up their right to veto action in cases where genocide and other mass killings are being committed.
