**俄罗斯向叙利亚反政府武装发动新的空袭**

俄罗斯向叙利亚反政府武装发动了新的空袭，以帮助阿萨德总统的政府收复失地。

莫斯科方面称，星期日的空袭击中63个目标，摧毁了其中的53个目标，许多空袭发生在塔尔史基克，那里是叙利亚反政府武装所控制的伊德利卜省的一处高地。

和最近的数次空袭一样，俄罗斯称袭击目标属于伊斯兰国激进分子。但是大多数的阵地并不为伊斯兰国所控制，而是对抗阿萨德政府的反政府武装。

俄罗斯总统普京在接受俄罗斯官方电视台采访时为莫斯科方面干预叙利亚局势进行辩护。他说，俄罗斯介入的目的是稳定大马士革政府，以及为政治和解开辟道路。

Russia Launches New Airstrikes Against Syrian Rebels

Russia launched a new aerial bombardment on Syrian rebels, helping President Bashar al-Assad's government reclaim territory it had lost.

Moscow said it hit 63 targets, destroying 53 of them, with many of the attacks Sunday in Tal Skik, a highland area of Idlib province that had been controlled by rebels fighting Syrian forces.

As with recent sorties, Russia described the targets as belonging to Islamic State insurgents. But most of the positions have not been held by that group, but rather factions fighting the Assad government.

In an interview with Russian state television, President Vladimir Putin defended Moscow's intervention in Syria, saying the objective is to stabilize the Damascus government and open the path for a political compromise.

**伊朗议会初步批准伊朗核协议**

伊朗议会星期天初步批准一项法案，允许政府落实伊朗与世界六大国达成的历史性核协议。

这项法案授权伊朗政府在另一方没有解除对伊朗制裁的情况下退出协议。预计这项法案在本星期晚些时候将能获得最终的批准。

法新社报道说，议会讨论不时被激烈的辩论和伊朗最高谈判代表的辩解打断。议会中的一名议员威胁说要杀了最高谈判代表。

伊朗原子能机构主席萨利希在议会激烈讨论结束的时候予以回击，为政府辩护。议会中一些议员指责他和其他官员在谈判中让步。

德黑兰的强硬派常常对伊朗两年来为达成核协议的外交努力大加指责。伊朗政府表示，协议能够保护伊朗的核项目，同时又能让国际社会解除对伊朗的经济制裁。

与此同时，伊朗成功试射了一枚新的远程地对地弹道导弹。这是自伊朗与世界大国达成核协议之后，伊朗方面第一次进行这类试验。

Iran's Parliament Gives Preliminary Approval for Nuclear Deal

Iran's parliament Sunday gave preliminary approval of a bill that allows the government to implement a historic nuclear deal reached with world powers.

Under the bill, the Iranian government will be authorized to withdraw from implementation of the deal if the other side fails to lift sanctions against Iran. Final approval of the measure is expected later this week.

The French news agency reported the discussions in parliament were punctuated by fiery debate and allegations from a top negotiator that a lawmaker had threatened to kill him.

Ali Akbar Salehi, head of Iran's Atomic Energy Agency, went on the attack for the government at the end of boisterous clashes where he and other officials were accused of having capitulated.

Hardliners in Tehran often railed against two years of diplomacy that led to the deal. Iran's government says the accord will protect the country's nuclear program while seeing international economic sanctions lifted.

Meanwhile, Iran successfully test fired a new guided long-range ballistic surface-to-surface missile - the first such test since Iran and world powers reach the nuclear agreement.
