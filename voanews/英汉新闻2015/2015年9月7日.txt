**危地马拉喜剧演员莫拉雷斯在大选中领先**

一名喜剧演员可能成为危地马拉新总统。

危地马拉星期日举行选举后，初步计票结果显示，喜剧演员、政界新人吉米·莫拉雷斯在三名总统候选人中居于领先地位，他可能会参加总统决选。

目前大约一半选票已经清点完毕，莫拉雷斯获得26%的选票。他的竞选口号是“不要腐败，不要盗窃”，受到选民的欢迎。上周末爆发的腐败丑闻使危地马拉受到震动，导致佩雷斯总统辞职。

Guatemalan Comedian Leads Presidential Vote

A comedian could be Guatemala's next president.

Jimmy Morales, a comedic actor and political novice is leading the pack of three candidates, according to early results, headed for a presidential runoff after Sunday's election in Guatemala.

With about half of the votes counted, Morales has 26 percent of the ballots. His campaign slogan "not corrupt, not a thief" resonated with voters after a corruption scandal rocked Guatemala late last week, ending in the resignation of President Otto Perez Molina.

"I planted love in my homeland and now I'm harvesting that love," Morales said Sunday after casting his vote.

Conservative businessman Manuel Baldizon trailed Morales with 18 percent of the ballots, while former first lady Sandra Torres had 17 percent of the the votes.

**法国开始在叙利亚空中侦察或加入空袭**

法国总统奥朗德星期一说，法国将开始对叙利亚进行空中侦查，并有可能加入美国领导的盟国对叙利亚境内伊斯兰国激进分子的空袭行动。

法国战机一直参加对伊拉克境内激进分子目标的空袭，但将成为美国之后第一个参加袭击叙利亚境内目标的西方国家。

奥朗德说：“我已经告诉国防部，可以从明天开始对叙利亚展开空中侦查，让我们能够计划对达伊沙目标的空袭。” 奥朗德使用了首字母缩写达伊沙 (达伊沙源于阿拉伯语，意指伊斯兰国)。

奥朗德同时明确表示，不会考虑派法国地面部队进入叙利亚。在叙利亚，政府军、反政府武装、与基地组织有关的武装以及伊斯兰国激进分子相互交战，争夺地盘。


France to Begin Syria Surveillance Flights Ahead of Possible Islamic State Airstrikes

France will begin surveillance flights over Syria ahead of possibly joining the U.S.-led coalition of countries conducting airstrikes against Islamic State militants there, President Francois Hollande said Monday.

French warplanes have been taking part in airstrikes targeting the militants in Iraq, but would be the first Western country other than the U.S. to participate in bombing targets in Syria.

"I have asked the Defense Ministry that from tomorrow surveillance flights can be launched over Syria, allowing us to plan airstrikes against Daesh," Mr. Hollande said, using an acronym for the Islamic State group.

He also made it clear that he is not considering sending French ground troops into Syria, where government troops, rebel fighters, al-Qaida-linked forces and Islamic State militants are all battling for territory.
