US, South Korean Forces Conduct Joint Landing Exercise

U.S. and South Korean forces held a landing drill Monday near the port city of Pohang, as part of the annual Foal Eagle military exercise.

South Korean military officials said the drill mobilized about 7,600 navy and marine personnel and 30 naval vessels, as well as several landing crafts.

Earlier this month, North Korea fired two short-range missiles off its east coast, hours before the joint military exercises began.

North Korea regularly protests the joint drills, which it calls a rehearsal for invasion.

Foal Eagle runs through April 24.

**法国执政党在地方选举中受挫**

在法国星期日举行的地方选举中，执政党社会党及其领袖奥朗德受挫于前总统萨科齐领导的保守派人民运动联盟以及极右翼党派民族阵线。民族阵线以反移民和反伊斯兰作为竞选纲领。

选民们在决选中投票选举98个地方议会的4108名议员。

社会党控制的大约一半地方议会被人民运动联盟拿走，萨科齐可以据此争取2017年再度当选总统。

民族阵线没有赢得所有议会的控制权，但该党候选人在全国各地的地方议会中都赢得了议席。民族阵线在选举中的斩获被视为该党领袖勒庞的总统竞选活动开始获得底层民众的支持。勒庞公开反对移民，并反对伊斯兰教融入法国社会。

法国总理瓦尔斯承认社会党“受挫”，并表示极右翼政党民族阵线赢得“太多”。

瓦尔斯还说，法国民众对日常生活过于艰苦感到烦恼。他保证政府将加倍努力，振兴法国经济。法国是欧元区的第二大经济体。

French Socialists Dealt Blow in Local Elections

France's ruling Socialist party and its leader Francois Hollande took a drubbing in local elections Sunday from the conservative UMP party led by former President Nicolas Sarkozy and the far-right National Front - or FN - party with its anti-immigration and anti-Islam platform.

Voters went to the run-off polls to choose 4,108 people who will sit on 98 local councils.

The Socialists lost about half of their councils to the conservative UMP party, opening the way for Mr. Sarkozy to mount a campaign for another bid at the presidency in 2017.

The FN did not win an entire council, but scores of its candidates across the country won seats on local councils. The FN wins are seen as the beginning of grassroots support for the presidential campaign for the group's leader, Marine Le Pen, who has been outspoken in her views against immigration and the integration of Islam into French society.

Prime Minister Manuel Valls acknowledged the "setback" for the Socialists and said the far-right FN's gains were "too high."

Mr. Valls also said France had declared its "anger at a daily life that is too difficult" and promised to "redouble" the government's efforts to revive the French economy, the second largest in the eurozone.
