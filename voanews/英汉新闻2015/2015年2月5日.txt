**获释的澳大利亚记者称不更换职业**

澳大利亚记者格雷斯特表示，尽管他因被控散布“假消息”而被埃及当局监禁400天，他愿继续做外国媒体记者。

本星期早些时候，这名半岛电视台记者被埃及驱逐出境。星期四，格雷斯特面带笑容，与他的父母在家乡布里斯班出席了记者会。他表示，不会放弃自己的工作。

格雷斯特还谈到，他的同事埃及裔加拿大公民法赫米和埃及公民默哈迈德还在狱中，这让他感到难过。

这三名记者于2013年12月被逮捕。埃及法庭指控他们支持被取缔的穆斯林兄弟会以及散布假消息，但检察官几乎没有提出任何证据。

格雷斯特说，他在狱中经受了精神和身体的磨难。但他表示自己的“健康状况相当好”，并说他和他的同事在监狱里没有受到虐待。

Freed Journalist Greste Says He Doesn't Want to Change Careers

Australian journalist Peter Greste says he wants to remain a foreign news correspondent, even after spending 400 days in an Egyptian jail on charges of broadcasting "false news."

The Al-Jazeera journalist, who was deported from Egypt earlier this week, smiled broadly as he spoke at a news conference Thursday alongside his parents in his hometown of Brisbane.

Greste also spoke of the difficulty in leaving behind his colleagues, Canadian-Egyptian Mohamed Fahmy and Egyptian citizen Baher Mohamad, who remain in jail.

The journalists were arrested in December 2013 under charges they aided the banned Muslim Brotherhood and spread false news, though prosecutors provided little evidence for the accusations.

Greste said his time in detention was tough physically and mentally. But he added that he is in "pretty good health" and that he and his colleagues were not abused while in jail.


**克里访问乌克兰，与波罗申科会谈**

美国国务卿克里星期四在基辅与乌克兰总统波罗申科举行会谈。法国和德国领导人也宣布要访问乌克兰，提出新的和平建议。

美国国务院一名高级官员在克里抵达基辅之前宣布美国将向乌克兰再提供价值1640万美元的人道援助，帮助在乌克兰军队和亲俄反政府武装冲突中受害的乌克兰东部平民。

这位官员还说，美国继续评估是否为乌克兰提供“用于防御的杀伤性武器”，但是他表示，有关方面担心乌克兰军队在使用这类上是否接受过充分训练。

这位官员补充说，华盛顿正在与欧洲伙伴国家讨论在近期内对俄罗斯采取更多制裁措施，如果俄罗斯继续在乌克兰的干预。

最近一轮旨在结束九个月叛乱的和谈在上星期破裂后，乌克兰东部暴力升级。

法国总统奥朗德星期四说，他和德国总理默克尔将访问乌克兰，提出“以乌克兰领土完整为基础的新的解决冲突办法”。奥朗德说，他和默克尔星期四将与波罗申科讨论磋商这一计划，然后前往莫斯科与俄罗斯总统普京举行会谈。

目前还不知道和平建议的具体内容。

在布鲁塞尔，北约秘书长斯托尔滕伯格宣布北约星期四加强俄罗斯边界附近的防御，以回应莫斯科在乌克兰的“侵略行动”。

Kerry in Ukraine for Talks with Poroshenko

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is in Kyiv for talks with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, while the leaders of France and Germany announced they are also heading to Ukraine with a new peace proposal.

Ahead of Kerry's arrival, a senior State Department official announced the U.S. is providing Kyiv with an additional $16.4 million in aid to help civilians affected by fighting between Ukraine's military and pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine.

The official also said the U.S. continues to evaluate whether to provide "defensive lethal weapons" to Ukraine, but he said there were concerns whether Ukrainian forces had adequate training to handle such equipment.

The official added that Washington is talking to its European partners about imposing additional sanctions against Russia in the near future, if Russian interference in Ukraine continues.

Violence in eastern Ukraine escalated after last week's breakdown of the latest round of peace talks aimed at ending the nine-month rebellion.

French President Francois Hollande said Thursday he and German Chancellor Angela Merkel will visit Ukraine to present a "new solution to the conflict based on the territorial integrity of Ukraine." President Hollande and Chancellor Merkel will discuss the plan with President Poroshenko before heading to Moscow for talks with Russian leaders, said the French leader.

No details of the peace initiative were immediately available.

In Brussels, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance was set Thursday to strengthen its defenses near Russia's borders in response to Moscow's "aggressive actions" in Ukraine.
