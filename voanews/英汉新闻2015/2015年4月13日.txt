**苏丹选举遭到抵制 巴希尔为获胜扫清道路**

苏丹星期一开始举行全国选举，由于主要反对党对此次选举进行抵制，巴希尔总统将确保赢得新的任期，同时他的全国大会党将在选举中获胜。

巴希尔目前受到国际刑事法院的通缉，他被控犯有战争罪。自1989年以来，巴希尔一直掌权，并赢得了2010年的选举，但反对派声称那次选举受到操纵。在星期三的选举中，选民们只能在巴希尔和一些次要候选人之间做出选择。

欧盟、美国、英国和挪威都对这次选举提出批评，指出苏丹没有承诺进行全国范围的对话，因此不会有具有包容性的政治进程。

欧盟外交政策负责人莫盖里尼说，这次选举不会产生“在整个国家都具有合法性的可信结果”。

南苏丹于2011年脱离苏丹而独立，接手了前苏丹大片的石油资源。在此之后，1300万选民在苏丹举行的首次总统选举中投了票，当时巴希尔保证实现和平及经济发展。

Bashir Has Clear Path to New Term in Boycotted Sudan Elections

National elections began Monday in Sudan with voters sure to give a new term to President Omar al-Bashir and a victory to his National Congress Party because of a boycott by the country's main opposition parties.

Mr. Bashir, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court on war crimes charges, has been in power since 1989 and won a 2010 vote that the opposition alleged was rigged. Voters have only the president and a collection of minor candidates to choose from in the election that runs through Wednesday.

The European Union, United States, Britain and Norway have all criticized the election, saying the lack of a promised national dialogue has left Sudan without an inclusive political process.

Federica Mogherini, the EU's foreign policy chief, said the election "cannot produce a credible result with legitimacy throughout the country."

Mr. Bashir has promised peace, development and improvements for the country's economy as up to 13 million voters take part in the first presidential election since South Sudan seceded in 2011, taking with it a vast majority of Sudan's former oil resources.

Rubio Set to Join 2016 US Presidential Race

The race to become the next U.S. president is quickly getting crowded, with Senator Marco Rubio set to announce his bid Monday, a day after former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton launched her campaign.

The 43-year-old Rubio, who is the son of Cuban immigrants, is expected to formally join the race at an event Monday evening in Miami at the site where authorities first registered Cubans fleeing the government of Fidel Castro in the 1960s.

A video promoting the announcement casts Rubio's campaign as a "new direction for America." It features clips of speeches where he promotes the need for the U.S. to be a strong world leader and criticizes the policies of President Barack Obama.

Rubio will be the third Republican to compete for the party's nomination for the 2016 election, joining fellow Senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush are also expected to run.

Clinton announced her candidacy to be the Democratic nominee in an online video Sunday in which she promised to work for the middle class.
