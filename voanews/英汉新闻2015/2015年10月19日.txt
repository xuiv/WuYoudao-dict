Yemen Government, Houthi Rebel Envoys to Meet in Geneva

A top United Nations official says the Yemeni government has agreed to meet at the end of the month in Geneva for talks with Houthi rebels aimed at implementing a U.N. resolution that would end months of heavy fighting.

Special U.N. envoy Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, writing on Facebook, said agreement on the meeting was reached after talks with exiled Yemen President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who is living in Saudi Arabia. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric later confirmed the talks.

The government's agreement to participate came after Iran-backed Shi'ite Houthi leaders formally committed last week to implementing a key U.N. Security Council resolution that calls on rebels to withdraw from Yemeni cities seized in the past year.

U.N. spokesman Dujarric said U.N. planners will work with government and Houthi representatives in the coming days to complete preparations for the upcoming talks.

US High School Student Says He Hacked CIA Chief's E-Mail

The FBI is investigating a claim by a high school student that he hacked the personal e-mail account of Central Intelligence Agency director John Brennan.

The anonymous student described himself to the New York Post newspaper as a marijuana smoker who backs the Palestinians. He said he used publicly-available information to break into Brennan's account and another account belonging to Homeland Security chief Jeh Johnson.

The suspect told CNN television Monday "John and Jeh are both very big people and high ranking people...if we hacked them, they would be ashamed. But it was really because the government are (sic) killing innocent people. They also fund (Israel) for killing innocent people."

The hacker claims to have seen Brennan's security clearance application for his federal job.

The CIA and Homeland Security say they are aware of the reports. The FBI would not comment.
