Danish Police Detain Two Men Suspected of Ties to Copenhagen Attacks

Danish police say they have detained two men suspected of helping a gunman who killed two people in separate shootings in Copenhagen Saturday.

Police said on Monday the two men are suspected of aiding and abetting the 22-year-old alleged gunman in carrying out shootings at a free-speech event and at Copenhagen's main synagogue.

Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt called the two shootings a "cynical act of terror against Denmark."

Police shot and killed the Denmark-born alleged gunman early Sunday after he opened fire on officers near a train station. His previous criminal record included violence and weapons offenses, according to police.

Danish intelligence chief Jens Madsen said investigators believe the gunman was inspired by Islamic radicalism.


**埃及利比亚战机空袭伊斯兰国目标以报复斩首行径**

埃及和利比亚军方说，两国战机星期一对利比亚东部的伊斯兰国目标发动空袭，以此报复伊斯兰国激进分子把在利比亚绑架的21名埃及科普特基督徒斩首。

在伊斯兰国公布显示这一屠杀行径的视频数小时后，埃及和利比亚空袭了德尔纳镇的激进分子训练营和武器库。

埃及总统塞西此前发表电视讲话，誓言对斩首事件做出反应，并将此次屠杀称作“可恶的恐怖主义行为”。

视频显示，数名身穿橙色囚服的男子被带到一个沙滩，每人身后跟着一名蒙面的激进分子。他们被迫跪下，一名激进分子用英语对着摄像机讲话后，这几名男子同时被斩首。

一名蒙面的激进分子说，这场残忍的谋杀是对“敌对埃及教会”的报复。科普特基督徒占埃及人口约10%，他们受到广泛的歧视和迫害。

Egyptian, Libyan Air Forces Bomb Islamic State Targets in Libya After Beheadings

Egyptian and Libyan warplanes carried out airstrikes Monday against the Islamic State group in eastern Libya, the militaries said, in retaliation for militants beheading 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians who were kidnapped in Libya.

The bombings targeting militant camps and weapons storage cities in the town of Darna came hours after the Islamic State group released a video purporting to show the killings.

Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi had pledged in a televised speech to respond to the beheadings, calling them an "abhorrent act of terrorism."

The video shows several men in orange jumpsuits being led along a beach, each accompanied by a masked militant. The men are made to kneel and one militant addresses the camera in English before the men are simultaneously beheaded.

The brutal murders were portrayed as retaliation against what a masked fighter described as “the hostile Egyptian church.” Coptic Christians make up about 10 percent of the Egyptian population and suffer widespread discrimination and persecution.
