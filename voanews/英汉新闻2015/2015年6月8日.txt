**七国峰会将讨论环境及能源问题**

世界工业化七国首脑会议星期一将举行第二天、也是最后一天的会议，重点讨论环境和能源问题，并将与非洲国家首脑举行会谈。

在星期日峰会开幕之前，美国总统奥巴马和德国总理默克尔举行了单独会谈。白宫说，双方一致认为，对俄罗斯的经济制裁持续多长时间，将取决于俄罗斯是否履行乌克兰停火协议。

默克尔对德国媒体说，工业化七国是基于共同的价值观而结成的团体，莫斯科由于其在乌克兰的所作所为而与这个团体格格不入。她表示，两者之间存在着一道障碍，目前还看不到如何跨越这道障碍。

俄罗斯总统普京连续第二年未获邀请出席峰会。普京去年第一次被拒于峰会之外，是因为俄罗斯并吞克里米亚半岛。

欧洲委员会主席图斯克说，欧盟和工业化七国领导人仍然坚决支持乌克兰打击东部的亲俄罗斯分离主义分子。

图斯克在埃尔毛城堡度假地说：“我们不仅是政治或经济利益集团，我们首先是一个有价值观的组织。所以今天俄罗斯不在这里。俄罗斯只要对乌克兰和其他国家表现出侵略性，就不会被邀请。”

G7 Summit Continues with Energy Talks, Meetings with African Leaders

Leaders at the G7 summit in Germany are meeting for a second and final day Monday with a focus on climate and energy issues, and talks with their counterparts from African nations.

Before the summit opened Sunday, U.S. President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel held their own talks where the White House said they agreed that how long economic sanctions against Russia remain in place depends on Russia's implementation of a cease-fire agreement in Ukraine.

Chancellor Merkel told German public broadcaster ARD that Moscow should stay out of the G7 "community of values" over its actions in Ukraine. "There is a barrier at the moment and I cannot really see how it can be overcome," she said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin was not invited to take part in the summit for the second year in a row. He was first excluded last year after Russia's annexation of the Crimean peninsula.

European Council President Donald Tusk said Sunday the European Union and the G7 leaders remain firm in their support of Ukraine in its fight against pro-Russian separatists.

Speaking at the luxury Schloss Elmau resort, Tusk said, "Our group is not only the political or economic group of interest, but first of all it is a community of values, and that is why Russia is not among us here today, and will not be invited as long as it behaves aggressively against Ukraine and other countries."

**墨西哥执政党赢得议会中期选举**

墨西哥星期一举行了议会下院选举，涅托总统及其盟友在中期选举后，继续在议会掌握得以维持运作的微弱多数。

星期日举行选举之前发生了暴力事件，据称几名候选人死于贩毒集团之手。

选民们在中期选举中通常投票并不踊跃，但由于持激进立场的教师工会和活动人士组成一个松散的联盟，誓言抵制选举，所以人们对这次中期选举表现出不同寻常的关注。

教师们要求大幅加薪、停止进行教师考试，并要求保证一所激进的师范学院的42名失踪学生的安全。

这些学生于去年9月失踪，检察官说，一个贩毒团伙已把他们杀害，并焚化了尸体。经DNA检测，只辨认出一名学生的尸体。

Mexican Ruling Party Wins Elections

Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and his allies retained a slim working majority Monday in the lower house of Congress following mid-term elections.

The run-up to Sunday's poll was marked by violence, with drug cartels blamed for the deaths of several candidates.

Mid-term elections usually draw a light turnout, but attention was unusually high this time as a loose coalition of radical teachers' unions and activists vowed to block the vote.

The teachers' demands included huge wage increases, an end to teacher testing and the safe return of 42 missing students from a radical teachers' college.

Those students disappeared in September, and prosecutors say they were killed and incinerated by a drug gang. Only one student's remains were identified by DNA testing.
