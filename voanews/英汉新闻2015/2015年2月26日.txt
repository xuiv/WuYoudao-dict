**韩国取消通奸禁令**

一家韩国法院废除了一项禁止婚外性行为的法律。这项具有争议的法律已经施行了数十年。

韩国宪法法院星期四进行投票，以七票对两票的表决结果废除了通奸法。该法律是1953年颁行的。

首席法官朴翰哲说：“即使通奸行为应该受到道义谴责，国家权力也不应干预个人的私生活。”

韩国官方公布的数字显示，在以往六年期间，5400多人被控犯有通奸罪，不过极少依法判刑。

颁布通奸禁令的目的是倡导性别平等，因为当时的韩国已婚女子几乎没有其他权利。近几十年来，随着韩国文化迅速现代化，反对这项法律的呼声日益增高。

South Korea Overturns Ban on Adultery

A South Korean court has struck down a controversial, decades-old law that bans extra-marital sex.

The Constitutional Court on Thursday ruled by a vote of seven to two against the adultery ban, which was enacted in 1953.

"Even if adultery should be condemned as immoral, state power should not intervene in individual private lives," said presiding justice Park Han-Chul.

More than 5,400 people have been indicted on adultery charges in the past six years, according to official figures, though jail terms were rarely given out under the law.

The adultery ban initially was seen as an attempt to promote gender equality, since married women had few other rights. But the law became increasingly unpopular as South Korean culture rapidly modernized in recent decades.


**美国朝网络中立性迈进一步**

美国联邦通信委员会星期四将投票表决一项有关确保美国互联网成为一个自由公开的交易平台的提案。

预计该委员会将通过委员会主席维勒提交的这项提案。该提案禁止所谓的“付费优先权”，即互联网服务商在收取内容提供商更高费用后，该提供商即可享受更快捷的宽带服务。

维勒本月早些时候宣布的这一提案将依照一项已实行数十年的通信法案来管理互联网，而制定该法案的初衷是将电话业作为公共设施加以管理。

维勒在《连线》杂志上说，他的提案将确保互联网成为创意和自由见解的公开平台。

'Net Neutrality' One Step Closer to Reality for US Internet Sector

The U.S. Federal Communications Commission will vote Thursday on a proposal that would ensure the nation's Internet sector operates as a free and open marketplace.

The commissioners are expected to approve a proposal offered by chairman Tom Wheeler that would ban so-called paid prioritization, in which big Internet service providers would charge content providers a higher fee to stream their material over cyberspace faster than smaller customers.

Wheeler's proposal, which he announced earlier this month, would regulate the Internet under a section of the decades old Communications Act that regulates the telephone industry like a public utility.

In an opinion piece for Wired magazine, Wheeler said his proposal would "preserve the Internet as an open platform for innovation and free expression."
