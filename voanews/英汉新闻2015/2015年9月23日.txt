**中国宣布购买300架波音飞机**

美国波音公司宣布，中国公司已经同意购买300架波音飞机，包括250架单走廊的737客机和50架宽体喷气机，总价值达380亿美元。

这一创纪录的订单宣布之际，正值中国国家主席习近平在西雅图以北的埃弗雷特工厂内一个组装车间里对大约600名波音公司员工讲话。

这一协议最初是由中国官方的新华社报道的。该协议还要求波音公司在中国建厂。

星期三早些时候，习近平与来自一些美国和中国巨头公司的30名首席执行官们会面。

包括波音、微软、星巴克、亚马逊、苹果、IBM和通用汽车等公司的首席执行官们参加了这次会晤，习近平提醒他们说，中国经济形势良好，有着巨大的发展潜力，中国也正为更加开放和透明而努力，

习近平也谈到美中之间的关系。他说，截止到今年8月，有6.5万家美国公司在中国投资总额达到约760亿美元。他说，中国在美国的投资在增加，美国44个州有大约1600家中国公司，这些公司直接创造了8万个全职工作。

习近平在展开为期一周的美国之行之际于星期二发表的讲话被认为是一次重要的政策讲话。他在讲话中呼吁改善与华盛顿的关系。他说，如果中国和美国合作顺利，它们可能成为全球稳定的基石。如果两国进入冲突或对抗，这将给两国乃至整个世界带来灾难。

China Announces Purchase of 300 Boeing Planes During Xi Visit to Seattle

Boeing has announced that Chinese companies have agreed to buy 300 jets from Boeing. The 250 single-aisle 737s and 50 widebody jets carry a list price of about $38 billion.

The record order was announced as Chinese President Xi Jinping addressed about 600 Boeing employees inside an assembly bay at the Everett factory, just north of Seattle, Washington.

The deal, first reported by China's official Xinhua news agency, also calls for the U.S. aerospace giant to build a plant in China.

Earlier Wednesday, Xi met with a high-powered group of 30 CEOs from some of America's and China’s largest businesses.

CEOs of Boeing, Microsoft, Starbucks, Amazon, Apple, IBM and General Motors, among others, were in attendance as Xi reminded them that China economy’s was doing well with big growth potential and that his country is working on being more open and transparent.

Xi also touted the ties between the U.S. and China, saying that, as of August, 65,000 U.S. businesses were in China investing some $76 billion total. Chinese investment in the U.S. is rising, he said, with some 1,600 Chinese companies in 44 states, and that those companies directly created 80,000 full-time jobs.

In what was billed as a major policy speech late Tuesday as he began his week-long tour of the United States, President Xi called for better relations with Washington.

"If China and the U.S. cooperate well, they can become a bedrock of global stability," Xi said. "Should they enter into conflict or confrontation, it would lead to disaster for both countries and the world at large."

**大众汽车首席执行官辞职**

德国大众汽车首席执行官文德恩星期三辞职。大众汽车由于承认在1千1百万辆柴油车的排放控制上做手脚以通过污染测试而陷入丑闻。

文德恩公开发表声明，对柴油引擎中检查出的“违规”承担责任，但是他表示“不知道有任何不当行为。”

他说，大众需要一个新的开始，这也是指人事方面。他说，“我以我的辞职为这个新开始理清道路。”他还表示大众汽车应该继续进行“澄清和透明”的程序。

美国环境保护局的监管人员星期五说，大众汽车给在美国的大约50万辆柴油汽车加上了软件，使得汽车在年检时打开污染控制系统，而在其他时候关闭。

Volkswagen CEO Resigns Over Pollution Controls on Millions Diesel Vehicles

Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn resigned Wednesday amid a scandal in which the German carmaker admitted to have tampered with emission controls on 11 million diesel vehicles to pass pollution tests.

Winterkorn made a public statement taking responsibility for the “irregularities” detected in diesel engines, but said that he was “not aware of any wrongdoing.”

“Volkswagen needs a fresh start, also in terms of personnel,” Winterkorn said. “I am clearing the way for this fresh start with my resignation.” He also said that Volkswagen should continue the process of “clarification and transparency.”

Friday, U.S. regulators of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said Volkswagen had equipped about 500,000 diesel cars in the United States with software that switched anti-pollution controls on during tests, but shut off the devices during normal driving.
