**梵蒂冈逮捕两名泄密嫌疑人**

罗马教廷星期一承认，梵蒂冈逮捕了一名西班牙神父和一名女信徒，他们涉嫌窃取机密材料并透露给媒体。

根据一份声明，这两个人在教宗方济各为研究梵蒂冈经济改革而设立的一个特别委员会工作。他们在本周末被逮捕并受到审讯。

女信徒弗朗西斯卡·沙努基星期一在同意配合调查后获释。但是，西班牙神父鲁西奥·安格尔·瓦列霍·巴尔达的情况尚不明了。

法新社指出，这一事件是梵蒂冈三年来第二起外泄丑闻。现已退休的教宗本笃十六世的侍从加布里埃勒2012年因窃取教宗私人文件并将其泄露给一名记者而被判罪。

据路透社报道，计划于本周出版的两名意大利作家的书籍包含了梵蒂冈以往丑闻的新证据。

Vatican Arrests 2 Suspected of Leaking Documents

The Vatican arrested a Spanish priest and a laywoman suspected of stealing confidential documents and leaking them to the media, the Holy See acknowledged Monday.

The two, who served on a special commission established by Pope Francis to study economic reform of the Vatican, were arrested and interrogated over the weekend, according to a statement.

Francesca Chaouqui, the laywoman, was released Monday after she agreed to cooperate with the probe. The status of Spanish priest Lucio Angel Vallejo Balda was unclear.

French news agency AFP noted the incident is the Vatican's second leak scandal in three years. The butler to Pope Benedict XVI, Paolo Gabriele, was convicted in 2012 of stealing the now-emeritus pontiff's private papers and leaking them to a journalist.

Reuters reported books by two Italian authors, containing new evidence on past Vatican scandals, are scheduled for release this week.

**美国海军继续寻找失踪货轮**

美国海军一支救援队准备展开一个遥控海底搜索行动，以证实在巴哈马群岛附近发现的残骸是否属于上月在一场飓风中失踪的灯塔号货轮。

长度为790英尺的灯塔号于10月1号遭遇“华金”飓风后失踪，船上有33名船员。

有关当局说，计划对海底残骸进行调查，希望能够发现航行数据记录器，从中发现失事船只的线索。

美国国家交通安全委员会发言人努德森说，如果在海底搜索行动中发现遗体，就将设法打捞。

灯塔号失踪前，船长戴维森曾发出求救信号，表示货轮在从佛罗里达州杰克森威尔驶往哥斯达黎加的圣胡安途中引擎发生故障。

美国海岸警卫队进行了大范围搜索，但只发现了一些漂浮的碎片和一具穿着救生衣的尸体，而且未能成功打捞。

自1983年以来，灯塔号失踪是美国发生的最严重海难。

US Navy to Search Wreckage Thought to be Missing Ship

A U.S. Navy salvage team is preparing to launch a remotely operated submersible to confirm that wreckage discovered near the Bahamas is that of the cargo ship El Faro, lost in a hurricane last month.

The 790-foot El Faro vanished on October 1 with 33 crew members during Hurricane Joaquin.

Authorities said they aim to survey the wreckage and hope to locate a voyage data recorder — the ship's "black box" - that could yield clues as to what happened.

If human remains are encountered during the submersible operation, the Navy will attempt to recover them, National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Peter Knudson said.

El Faro's captain made a distress call before the vessel disappeared, saying the ship had lost engine power during its voyage from Jacksonville, Florida, to San Juan, Puerto Rico.

An extensive search by the U.S. Coast Guard found only floating debris and one body in a survival suit, which was not recovered.
