China WWII 'Victory' Parade Showcases Military Strength

A relentless stream of tanks, ballistic missiles, and goose-stepping soldiers paraded into Beijing's Tiananmen Square on Thursday in a massive display of military strength meant to commemorate the victory over Japan in World War II.

Chinese President Xi Jinping used the occasion to announce that over 300,000 troops will be cut from the People's Liberation Army. In a speech kicking off the parade, Xi said the move is a demonstration that China is devoted to peace.

"No matter how much stronger it may become, China will never seek hegemony or expansion," said the Chinese president.

It is the fourth major reduction in troops since the 1980s for the PLA, which currently has 2.3 million members.

Migrant Boat Sinks Off Malaysia; 13 Dead

A overcrowded, wooden migrant boat has capsized in stormy seas off the coast of Malaysia, killing at least 13 people, according to Malaysian officials.

Maritime officials say the boat was likely taking Indonesian workers back home to Sumatra island.

As many as 100 people are believed to have been on board the boat, say Malaysia officials, who have dispatched several vessels and a plane to look for survivors.

Around two million Indonesians are believed to be working illegally in Malaysia. They often make the journey in rickety, overcrowded boats, often at night, to avoid being spotted by authorities.
