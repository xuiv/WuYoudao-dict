**沈阳警察开枪打死三名维族“激进分子”**

中国警方说，他们开枪击毙了三名持刀的新疆激进分子。居住在西部边缘地区新疆的大多数人为穆斯林。

沈阳警方在社交网站上说，在星期一发生在沈阳的这起事件中，还有一人被打伤。

沈阳警方发表声明说，四名恐怖分子持刀拒捕，警察在其无视警告后开枪。

中国官员和国家媒体说，这四名男子是来自新疆的维族人。在新疆，针对官员和平民的暴力袭击有所增加。

很多流亡国外的维族人认为，中国当局对维族人进行宗教和经济歧视，而这种暴力是维族人做出的绝望反应。大批维族人逃离新疆甚至流亡海外。

中国当局否认歧视维族人，并声称一直投入大量资金来提高新疆的生活水平。

Chinese Police Kill 3 Uighur 'Terrorists'

Chinese police say they have shot and killed three people described as knife-wielding militants from the mainly Muslim far western region of Xinjiang.

A fourth person was injured in the incident that occurred Monday in the northeastern city of Shenyang, according to social media posting by city police.

"Four terrorists armed with knives resisted arrest, (and) police fired shots only after the terrorists ignored warnings," according to the statement.

Officials and state media described the men as ethnic Uighurs from Xinjiang, which has seen a disturbing increase in violent attacks against official and civilian targets.

Many exiled Uighurs see the violence as a desperate response to China's religious and economic discrimination against Uighurs, who have fled the region and even the country in waves.

Beijing denies discriminating against the Turkic-speaking Uighurs, saying it is pouring money into the region and improving living standards.


**美国军方考虑允许变性者入伍**

美国军方将考虑允许变性者入伍，不过需要六个月的时间来研究这一问题。

美国国防部长卡特星期一下令实施这项研究。卡特表示“国防部有关变性军人的现行规章已经过时并导致不确定性，使指挥官们无法将精力集中在我们的核心使命上”。

卡特说，他将成立一个工作组，负责审议有关禁止变性者入伍的现行政策。但他表示，工作组在展开审议过程之前将设立一个前提，即变性者可以在不影响军队的效率和战备状态的情况下公开服役...

2011年，美国军方正式取消了“不问不说”政策。按照这项政策，同性恋者可以服役，但不能在军中公开自己的性取向。

US Military Considers Lifting Ban on Transgender Personnel

The U.S. military will consider allowing transgender individuals to join, and there will be a six-month study into the issue.

Secretary of Defense Ash Carter ordered the review Monday, saying the "Defense Department's current regulations regarding transgender service members are outdated and are causing uncertainty that distracts commanders from our core missions."

Carter said he is creating a working group to review current policies banning transgender individuals. However, he said the group will begin the process with "the presumption that transgender persons can serve openly without adverse impact on military effectiveness and readiness..."

In 2011, the U.S. military formally ended its "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy that allowed gays to serve only if they did not reveal their sexual orientation.
