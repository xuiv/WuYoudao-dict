Syrian al-Qaida seized the city of Idlib

A Syrian al-Qaida group and its allies have seized the Syrian city of Idlib for the first time in the country's four-year conflict.

The al-Nusra Front led other Islamic groups in Saturday's takeover following four days of fighting. The al-Nusra Front announced the capture of the northwestern Syrian city through social media.

Syria's official news agency did not report Idlib's fall, saying the army is fighting "fierce battles" to gain control of the city.

Idlib is the second provincial capital and major urban center lost by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces in the four-year-old conflict.

The northeastern city of Raqqa fell to rebels, including the al-Nusra Front, in 2013.

Tunisian Forces Kill Main Suspect in Museum Attack

Tunisian security forces say they have killed the main suspect in the deadly museum attack that targeted foreign tourists, as thousands took to the streets of the capital to denounce extremism.

Tunisia's state news agency TAP says Abou Sakhr Lokman was killed, along with eight others, late Saturday during an anti-terrorist operation in the Gafsa region near the Algerian border.

Officials say Lokman's group, which is affiliated with the North African branch of al-Qaida, organized the March 18 attack on the Bardo museum that left 21 foreign tourists and a Tunisian policeman dead.

On Sunday, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Tunis to protest extremist violence in the country.

Leaders from several countries, including France and Italy, joined Tunisian leaders for the march from the seat of government at Bab Es-Saadoun to the museum.
