**美国特勤局四名高官被调任**

美国特勤局四名高官被调任。此前，白宫安全保卫工作出现一系列疏漏，负责保卫奥巴马总统及家人的特勤局倍感难堪。

特勤局代局长克兰西星期三发表声明，宣布负责调查、保卫行动以及技术和公共事务的助理局长被解职。

克兰西说，他是根据去年12月的一项独立报告作出这个决定的。那个报告认为特勤局急需领导。

报告起草前，一名陆军退伍军人去年9月持刀攀越白宫围栏，并跑进总统官邸，后被制服。内部审议认为，训练差，人手少以及连续失误等原因与这次事故有关。

事件导致当时的局长朱利亚•皮尔森辞职。

Top Officials at US Secret Service Demoted in Wake of Security Breach

Four senior officials in the U.S. Secret Service have been reassigned in response to a series of security lapses that embarrassed the agency responsible for protecting President Barack Obama and his family.

Acting Director Joseph Clancy issued a statement Wednesday announcing that the agency's assistant directors for investigations, protective operations, technology and public affairs were being removed from their posts.

Clancy said he made the decision based on an independent report issued last December that described the agency as starved for leadership.

The report was drafted after an Army veteran carrying a knife climbed over the White House fence back in September and ran inside the presidential mansion before he was finally subdued. An internal review concluded that bad training, poor staffing and a series of missteps contributed to the breach.

The incident led to the resignation of then-director Julia Pierson.


**克里称全力支持保加利亚安全与民主**

美国国务卿克里表示，美国“全力支持保加利亚的安全、繁荣及其民主体制的健康” 。

克里首次以国务卿身份访问保加利亚。他在与鲍里索夫总理举行的一次联合记者会上发表上述讲话。克里还会晤了普列夫内利耶夫总统和米托夫外长，就保加利亚能源多样化、防务合作以及强化法治等问题交换意见。

美国国务院一名高级官员早些时候说，由于俄罗斯上个月取消了南溪管道项目，因此保加利亚对能源的高度依赖是克里与保加利亚官员讨论的议题之一。

Kerry: US "Deeply Committed" to Bulgarian Security, Democracy

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry says the United States is "deeply committed to Bulgaria's security, prosperity, and the health of its democratic institutions."

Kerry, who is on his first trip to Sofia as Secretary of State, made the comment in a joint news conference with Prime Minister Boyko Borisov. He also met with President Rosen Plevneliev and foreign Minister Daniel Mitov, discussing diversification of Bulgaria's energy resources, defense cooperation, and bolstering the rule of law.

A senior State Department official said earlier that Bulgaria’s "significant" energy dependence is on the agenda because of Russia’s cancellation of the South Stream pipeline project last month.
