EU Calls for Special Meeting on Migrant Crisis

The interior ministers of Britain, France and Germany have called for a special meeting of European Union interior and justice ministers within the next two weeks to deal with the continent's escalating migrant crisis.

The ministers said in a statement Sunday they want to find "concrete steps" to solve the growing migrant dilemma.

Macedonia declared a state of emergency earlier this month in response to daily border crossings from Greece of some 3,000 migrants pushing toward western European countries.

The United Nations estimates 300,000 migrants from the Middle East, Africa and South Asia have fled to Europe this year to escape poverty and violence.

Hundreds have drowned in the Mediterranean, and authorities expect those tolls, as well as fatalities from land smuggling, to rise.
