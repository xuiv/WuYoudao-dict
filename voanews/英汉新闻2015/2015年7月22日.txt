China Returns Passport to Artist, Critic Ai Weiwei

Four years after his passport was seized by Beijing authorities, Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei has gotten it back.

The 57-year-old artist and government critic made the announcement Wednesday on the social media site Instagram (https://instagram.com/p/5bdSb1qD6e/?taken-by=aiww), posting a photo of himself holding up the document, with a simple caption reading "Today, I received a passport." He offered no explanation as to why his passport was given back to him.

Ai Weiwei says he would like to travel to Germany, but it is uncertain how long it will be before he can travel outside of China.

His passport was taken from him in 2011 when he was arrested and detained for nearly three months. He was later fined $2.4 million for tax evasion, which he says was leveled against him because of his outspoken criticism of the ruling Communist government.

Ai Weiwei rose to international prominence after designing Beijing's Bird Nest Stadium for the 2008 Olympic Games.

Turkey Blocks Twitter In Response to Suruc Attack

Turkey says it has blocked access to Twitter to prevent the broadcast of photos of Monday's bombing in Suruc, in which at least 31 people died.

Turkish officials said the ban will be lifted once images related to the attack have been removed.

No one has claimed responsibility for Monday's suicide bombing, although Turkish officials say they have strong reasons to believe it was perpetrated by Islamic State militants.
