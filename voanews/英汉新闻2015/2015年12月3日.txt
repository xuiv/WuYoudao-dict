**英国空袭叙利亚境内伊斯兰国目标**

英国战机开始在叙利亚境内实施空袭。仅在数小时前，英国议会批准了一项扩大打击伊斯兰国组织的战略方案。

英国国防部官员星期四清晨说，皇家空军的龙卷风战机从英国驻塞浦路斯空军基地起飞，在叙利亚执行空袭任务后安全返回基地。

英国国防部在推特上说，这次空袭的目标是伊斯兰国控制的奥马尔油田，但没有透露对空袭战果的评估。

英国国防部还说，将增派八架战机前往阿克洛蒂里空军基地，该基地原有八架战机。

经过10小时辩论后，英国议会以397票对223票的表决结果，批准了卡梅伦首相提出的有关空袭叙利亚境内伊斯兰国目标的方案。

卡梅伦对议员们阐述这一方案时说，空袭属于打击伊斯兰国激进分子更大规模战略的一部分。

英国在伊拉克的空袭已经持续了一年多，卡梅伦敦促议会将针对激进分子的空袭行动扩展到叙利亚。

British warplanes carry out airstrikes in Syria

British warplanes have begun carrying out airstrikes in Syria, just hours after lawmakers in London approved an expanded strategy to defeat the Islamic State group.

Royal Air Force Tornado fighter jets took off from a British air base in Cyprus, struck targets in Syria, and returned safely to the base, British defense officials said early Thursday.

The defense ministry later said via Twitter that the bombs targeted the IS-controlled Omar oil fields, but did not provide any assessment of the strikes' results.

The ministry also said it was sending eight more warplanes to the Akrotiri air base from where the missions are being launched, doubling the number of British jets at the facility.

After 10 hours of debate, British lawmakers Wednesday approved (by a vote of 397-223) a request from Prime Minister David Cameron to take part in airstrikes against Islamic State in Syria.

Cameron appeared in parliament to make his case, saying the air strikes would be "part of a wider strategy" to overcome the militant movement.

Britain has been bombing in Iraq for more than a year and Cameron urged lawmakers to back extending air strikes to Syria.

New Arrests at FIFA Hotel in Zurich

Swiss authorities have made a new round of arrests in the FIFA corruption scandal, detaining a group of FIFA officials at the same Zurich hotel where the first round of arrests took place in May.

The New York Times reported Thursday that more than a dozen people were expected to face charges after the latest arrests at the Baur au Lac hotel. The Times reported that several of the officials were from South and Central America and were suspected of involvement in racketeering, money laundering, and fraud.

The report named Alfredo Hawit of Honduras, president of CONCACAF, the governing body for soccer in North America, Central America and the Caribbean, and Juan Angel Napout of Paraguay, president of South American soccer`s CONMEBOL governing body, among those arrested.

On November 18, suspended FIFA president Sepp Blatter and European football chief Michel Platini lost their appeals against provisional 90-days bans by the FIFA ethics committee.
