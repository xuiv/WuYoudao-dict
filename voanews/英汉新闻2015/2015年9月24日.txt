**麦加朝觐发生踩踏事件，300多人死亡**

沙特官员说，星期四在圣城麦加外面发生踩踏事件，参加年度麦加朝觐的人中至少有310人死亡，还有450人受伤。

踩踏事件发生在麦加以东几公里的米纳，朝觐者在那里参加“石击恶魔”仪式。这是麦加朝觐的最后一项活动，之后人们将庆祝古尔邦节。

沙特民防部门主管在推特上报告伤亡人数，并发布照片显示救援人员正在用担架将伤员抬上救护车，其中有一张图片显示有人正用人工呼吸抢救一位男子。

过去25年里，麦加朝觐期间发生过多起致命踩踏事件。每个身体健康的穆斯林一生中必须参加一次麦加朝觐，因此每年都有大批人前往沙特参加这个为期5天的活动。今年的朝觐者有大约200万之多。

1990年的踩踏事件最为严重，1400多人死亡。1994年、2004年和2006年的踩踏事件中，分别都有200多人丧生。

这个月早些时候，一座塔吊倒塌，砸向伊斯兰教最神圣的麦加大清真寺，导致109人丧生，约400人受伤。

Hajj Stampede Kills 310 Outside Mecca

Saudi officials said a stampede Thursday outside the city of Mecca killed at least 310 people and injured 450 others as they took part in the annual Muslim hajj pilgrimage.

The incident happened in Mina where pilgrims throw rocks at pillars representing the devil in the final hajj ritual before beginning the Eid al-Adha festival.

Saudi Arabia's civil defense directorate gave the casualty figures on its Twitter account and posted pictures showing rescue workers attending to people on stretchers, including one who appears to be trying to resuscitate a man.

Multiple deadly stampedes have taken place at the hajj during the past 25 years as huge numbers of people gathered for the five-day event required of all able-bodied Muslims once in their lifetime. This year, some 2 million people are participating.

The worst disaster happened in 1990 when a stampede in a Mina tunnel killed more than 1,400 people. Stampedes in 1994, 2004 and 2006 each killed more than 200 pilgrims.

Earlier this month, a construction crane collapsed at Mecca's Grand Mosque, killing 109 people and injuring about 400 others at Islam's holiest site.

在星期二发表政策性讲话时，习近平表示中国愿意在防止网络攻击方面同美国加强合作。

美国总统奥巴马说，他在与习近平会谈时将把网络犯罪作为一个主要议题。

预计奥巴马和习近平还将讨论南中国海领土争端问题，双方在这个问题上存在分歧。

中国的人权纪录是导致美中两国产生摩擦的另一个因素。几个人权组织敦促奥巴马在会见习近平时不要回避人权问题。

Obama, Xi To Address Touchy Topics During Talks

Chinese President Xi Jinping heads to Washington Thursday for talks with President Barack Obama on thorny issues including cyberattacks, human rights and economics, after spending the first two days of his U.S. visit focused primarily on the importance of cooperation between the two countries.

On Wednesday, Xi met the top leaders of some of America's largest tech companies, including Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Boeing and Facebook.

The Chinese leader assured them he is committed to improving intellectual property rights and making it easier for foreign companies to do business in China.

Boeing and Xi used the opportunity to announce that Chinese companies have agreed to buy 300 jets from the U.S. airplane maker. It also calls for the U.S. aerospace giant to build a plant in China.

In a major policy speech Tuesday, Xi said China was open to more cooperation with the U.S. on preventing cyberattacks.

Obama has vowed to make cybercrimes a top item on the agenda when he meets with his Chinese counterpart.

Another area of disagreement expected to be discussed is China's controversial territorial claims in the South China Sea.
China's human rights record is another source of friction, and several rights groups are urging Obama to not shy away from the issue during his meetings with Xi.
