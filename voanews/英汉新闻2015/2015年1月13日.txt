Pope Urges Justice, Unity in Sri Lanka

Pope Francis has highlighted the need for "justice, healing and unity" in Sri Lanka, where he arrived Tuesday for the start of a week-long trip to Asia.

The pope spoke at the international airport in Colombo, saying Sri Lanka needs to pursue the truth of what happened during its long civil war, and rebuilding must include a respect for human rights and "the full inclusion of each member of society."

The pope was greeted by newly inaugurated President Maithripala Sirisena, who has promised an independent domestic inquiry into wartime abuses.

The 78-year-old pontiff postponed a meeting with Sri Lankan bishops after the journey from the airport, in an open top car under hot sun, took longer than expected.

Pope Francis will spend two days in Sri Lanka before heading to the Philippines. On Wednesday, he will hold a seaside mass, in the capital, Colombo, and canonize the country's first saint, 17th century missionary Joseph Vaz.

The visit to Asia is the pope's second to the region since beginning his papacy, and is part of the Church's outreach to developing nations.

**埃及法庭将重审穆巴拉克**

埃及首都开罗一个上诉法庭星期二宣布，将重审被废黜总统穆巴拉克及其两个儿子被控挪用公款案。去年这三人被判多年监禁。

法庭的这个决定推翻了穆巴拉克仅剩的一项罪名。

司法界消息来源说，穆巴拉克目前被关在一所军队医院，可能在某个时候获释。但是一名安全官员告诉埃及官方的中东通讯社说，要等司法机关下令才能释放他。

去年5月，一个下级法院判定穆巴拉克和他的两个儿子挪用了原本用于修缮总统府的大约1700万美元。

现年86岁的穆巴拉克在一家军队医院里服刑三年，他的两个儿子阿拉和贾迈勒被判处四年监禁。

穆巴拉克还将因2011年抗议者死亡案再次受审。那次民众起义导致穆巴拉克三十年的统治终结。

穆巴拉克2012年被判处有罪并被判处终身监禁， 但法院后来推翻这一判决， 法院去年11月取消对他的指控。检方对这一决定提出上诉。

Egyptian Court Orders Retrial for Mubarak

An Egyptian appeals court says ousted President Hosni Mubarak and his two sons will get a retrial in the embezzlement case that earned them multi-year sentences last year.

The court in Cairo announced its decision Tuesday, a move that rolls back the only remaining conviction against Mr. Mubarak.

Judicial sources say Mr. Mubarak, currently detained at a military hospital, could be freed at some point. But a security official told Egypt's official MENA news agency that will not happen until the judiciary orders his release.

A lower court found the former Egyptian president and his two sons guilty in May, saying they embezzled about $17 million in funds to be used to renovate presidential palaces.

The 86-year-old Mr. Mubarak has been serving a three-year sentence in a military hospital, while sons Alaa and Gamal were each given four-year terms.

The former president is also facing a retrial in another case involving the deaths of protesters during the 2011 uprising that ended his three decades in power.

He was originally convicted in that case and sentenced to life in prison in 2012, but the verdict was later overturned, and a court dropped the charges in November.

Prosecutors have appealed the dismissal.
