**美国国防访问朝鲜半岛非军事区**

美国国防部长卡特呼吁朝鲜放弃其核武器项目。他在星期天访问了分割朝鲜和韩国的非军事区。

卡特从首尔前往非军事区，并走到一个最靠近北朝鲜一方的韦莱特观察哨。

平壤在2009年放弃了有关它的核项目的谈判。参加谈判的除了平壤之外，还包括中国、日本、俄罗斯、韩国和美国。卡特说，华盛顿依然致力于谈判，并呼吁平壤返回谈判。

他对记者说，“朝鲜应当减少并最终终止其核项目。”

卡特星期天晚些时候将在首尔参加美韩双方联合安全会议。

US Defense Chief Visits Korean DMZ

U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter called on North Korea to end its nuclear weapons program during a visit Sunday to the Demilitarized Zone that separates the two Koreas.

Carter traveled to the DMZ from Seoul and walked up to Observation Post Ouellete, the closest point where South Korea's side of the DMZ meets with the North's.

Pyongyang abandoned negotiations on its nuclear program in 2009 conducted with five other nations, including China, Japan, Russia, South Korea and the United States. Carter said Washington remains committed to the negotiations, and called on the communist country to return to the talks.

"They should be on a path of doing less, and ultimately zero, in the nuclear field," Carter told reporters.

Carter will attend a joint U.S.- South Korea security meeting in Seoul later Sunday.


**韩日中三国举行3年来的首次谈判**

韩国、中国和日本领导人举行2012年以来的首次首脑会谈，以努力摆脱几十年来残存的争议和怨恨。

韩国总统朴槿惠星期天做东招待日本首相安倍晋三和中国总理李克强。三位领导人将举行一天的会议，并预计集中讨论拟议中的三方自由贸易协定。

三位领导人还预计讨论重启停顿已久的朝鲜解除和武装的谈判。

朴槿惠总统在2013年上任时拒绝会晤安倍晋三首相，因为她认为安倍没有为日本在20世纪上半叶以残暴的方式占领朝鲜半岛、尤其是没有为日本军队强迫朝鲜妇女做慰安妇而做出恰当的道歉。

使三国关系复杂化的另一个因素是东京和北京队东中国海一组岛屿的主权归属有强烈的争议。

星期一， 朴槿惠总统将与安倍举行单独会谈。

South Korea, Japan, China Hold First Talks in Three Years

The leaders of South Korea, China and Japan held their first three-way summit since 2012 as they attempt to put aside lingering disputes and resentments dating back decades.

South Korean President Park Guen-hye hosted Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in Seoul Sunday for a daylong meeting that is expected to focus on negotiations over a proposed trilateral free trade agreement.

The three leaders are also expected to discuss reviving the long-dormant North Korean nuclear disarmament talks.

President Park had refused to meet with Abe since first taking office in 2013, believing he has not properly atoned for his country's brutal occupation of the Korean peninsula in the first half of the 20th century, especially the sexual enslavement of Korean women by Japanese forces.

Another factor complicating relations is a heated territorial dispute between Tokyo and Beijing over a group of islands in the East China Sea.

President Park will hold a one-on-one session with Abe on Monday.
