New Year Celebration over the World

The United States welcomed in New Year's Day 2015 with the traditional celebration in New York City's Times Square.

Hundreds of thousands of revelers gathered in the city's iconic tourist attraction to watch Mayor Bill de Blasio and his family push the button that dropped a giant crystal ball one minute before midnight. New Year's celebrations were also taking place in many other cities across the United States located in different time zones.

Hours earlier on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, Londoners gathered on the banks of the River Thames to watch a spectacular fireworks display over the Houses of Parliament, as the iconic Big Ben clock chimed at the stroke of midnight.

In the Asia Pacific region. a giant clock on Auckland's landmark Sky Tower counted down the minutes until the New Year, before fireworks launched from the tower lit the nighttime sky.

In Sydney, more than 1.5 million revelers massed in warm summer weather along the shores of the city's harbor to watch a spectacular eruption of pyrotechnics that featured depictions of shimmering gold and silver palm trees.

Splashy bursts of color from the fireworks filled the sky over Victoria Harbor in Hong Kong.

Beijing counted down to 2015 with a figure skating exhibition aimed at promoting China's bid to host the 2022 Winter Olympics, while the Persian Gulf emirate of Dubai readied what it said would be the largest-ever LED-illuminated facade, on the world's tallest building.

The Brazilian tourist attraction of Rio de Janeiro was expecting more than one million revelers to crowd its Copacabana Beach for rock concerts on three stages.

But in Indonesia, in the aftermath of the crash of the AirAsia passenger jet into the depths of the Java Sea, prayerful remembrances took precedence in Jakarta, and other cities canceled their normal New Year celebrations.


**金正恩称愿与韩国举行高层会谈**

朝鲜领导人金正恩说，他愿与对手韩国扩大“对话与合作。”

金正恩在发表传统的新年致辞时表示，他将考虑恢复目前陷于停滞状态的与首尔的高层会谈。

目前还不清楚金正恩提议进行的哪一级别的会谈。

在金正恩提出这一建议前，韩国本周曾提议1月与朝鲜举行高层会谈。

韩国统一部星期四表示欢迎金正恩的这一表示，并说金正恩如有诚意，就会接受韩国方面的提议。

最近一次韩朝会谈是在去年2月，双方同意于去年10月重启对话，但并未付诸实施。

韩朝会谈的议题通常是合作事项，如恢复安排上世纪50年代韩战离散家人的团聚活动。

Kim Jong Un open to talks with his rival

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un says he is open to expanding "dialogue and cooperation" with the country's rival, South Korea.

During a traditional New Year's Day speech, Mr. Kim said he would consider resuming "stalled high-level meetings" with Seoul.

It is not clear at what level the talks proposed by Mr. Kim would take place.

The proposal comes after South Korea this week offered to hold high-level meetings with North Korea in January.

Seoul's Unification Ministry on Thursday welcomed Mr. Kim's comments, saying if he is "sincere" then he would accept the South's offer of talks.

The last high-profile inter-Korean meeting occurred in February. The two Koreas agreed in October to restart the dialogue, but did not follow through.

The talks traditionally have covered areas of cooperation, such as resuming reunions between families separated by the 1950s Korean War.
