**希腊雅典证交所开盘后大幅下跌**

希腊股市星期一大幅下跌，交易指数开盘后下跌近23%。股价后来稳步回升，两小时后交易指数下跌不到19%。这是雅典证券交易所五周来首次开盘。

希腊政府为应对国家债务危机，今年六月底关闭了股票交易所和银行，客户只能少量限额提款。

希腊上月与欧盟和国际货币基金组织达成新的救助协议，并在7月20日重新开放银行，不过仍然实行资本管制。目前希腊继续与债权人就价值可能高达940亿美元的新救助计划的具体条件进行谈判。

这是欧盟五年来第三次对希腊实施救助计划。希腊今年曾就是否接受救助条件举行全民公投，结果多数人反对。许多希腊人反对应债权人的要求实行严格的紧缩政策。认为这只会加重希腊的经济问题。

Greek Stock Market Reopens with Sharp Losses

Greek stocks dropped sharply Monday when the Athens Stock Exchange opened for the first time in five weeks. The exchange index lost nearly 23 percent in the opening moments of trading. Shares steadily regained some ground, with the index down less than 19 percent after two hours.

The government closed the stock exchange in late June when it also shut down banks and imposed limits on money withdrawals in response to the country's debt crisis.

Greece reached an agreement on a new bailout with the European Union and International Monetary Fund last month and reopened the banks on July 20. Capital controls are still in place, and the government continues to negotiate with creditors on exact terms for a new rescue package that could be worth up to $94 billion.

The bailout is Greece's third in the span of five years. It came after weeks of negotiations and controversy that included Greek voters rejecting an earlier bailout package in a referendum. Many Greeks oppose the type of harsh austerity measures creditors’ demand, saying they only have made the country's economic woes worse.

Asian Markets Decline on Sluggish Chinese Manufacturing Figures

Sluggish economic activity in China and falling oil prices triggered a steep decline among Asian stock markets during Monday's early trading.

Investors pulled out of the markets after a private survey showed China's manufacturing activity in July falling to its lowest levels in two years. Economists say that suggests more rough water ahead for the world's second largest economy.

Oil prices were also trading lower Monday, with the benchmark U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude slipping to $46.85, while Brent crude oil was trading at $51.91. Copper prices also fell during Monday's trading,

The Shanghai index slumped over 1.5 percent, while Seoul's Kospi index dropped nearly one percent, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index lost as much as one percent.
