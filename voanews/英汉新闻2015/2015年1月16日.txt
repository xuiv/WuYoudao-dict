**火星惊现英国消失十多年的太空探测器**

欧洲宇航局说，在火星上找到了十多年前失踪的英国建造的太空探测器。

英国宇航局星期五说，小猎犬2号探测器一部分被部署在火星表面，从而揭开了探测器失踪之谜。

英国宇航局说，探测器只有一部分被部署在火星上，这就是为什么小猎犬2号之前音信全无。探测器的所有太阳能板必须都到位，才能发出数据，并从地球接受指令。

英国宇航局说，美国航天局发射的火星勘测轨道飞行器拍摄的卫星图像提供了确凿证据。

这一发现显示， 小猎犬2号探测器2003年圣诞节成功在火星着陆，下降和着陆程序没有问题。

小猎犬2号探测器当年是由欧洲航天局的火星快车送去火星的，任务是利用寻找生命迹象的仪器，向地球发回信息。 但是探测器降落后信息全无。

推动建造这一探测器的英国行星科学家科林•皮林格去年去世，享年70岁。

Long Lost British Space Probe Found on Mars

The European Space Agency says a British-built space probe that disappeared more than a decade ago on Mars has been found.

The British space agency said Friday the Beagle 2 spacecraft "has been found partially deployed on the surface of the planet, ending the mystery of what happened to the mission."

The agency said the partial deployment "would explain why no signal or data was received" from the Beagle because "full deployment of all the solar panels was needed" to transmit data and receive commands from Earth.

The agency said there was "clear evidence" of the lost lander in satellite images taken by the U.S. space agency NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.

Officials said the find showed that "the entry, descent and landing sequence for Beagle 2 worked and the lander did successfully touch down on Mars on Christmas Day 2003."

Britain's Beagle 2 was carried to the red planet on ESA's Mars Express. The Beagle was to report back from Mars using instruments designed to help search for signs of life, but nothing was heard after it was dropped off to make its landing.

British planetary scientist Colin Pillinger who was the driving force behind the mission died last year at the age of 70.

**奥巴马与卡梅伦白宫会谈**

美国总统奥巴马和英国首相卡梅伦星期五在华盛顿举行第二天会谈。

白宫说，奥巴马和卡梅伦将讨论反恐、埃博拉、俄罗斯在乌克兰的行动和网络安全等一系列问题。预计双方还会宣布今年晚些时候举行防范银行被袭的联合网络“军演”计划。

卡梅伦曾表示，他准备请奥巴马总统向谷歌、脸书等美国科技公司施加压力，允许政府监视加密通信。

这在美国是一个敏感话题。 美国国家安全局前合同工斯诺登2013年泄露国安局收集数百万美国人电话记录，引起公愤。斯诺登还泄露说，有几家美国因特网公司允许国安局接触顾客数据。

奥巴马和卡梅伦周四在白宫共进工作晚餐。

Obama, Cameron Meet at White House

U.S. President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron are meeting for a second day of talks Friday in Washington.

White House officials say Mr. Obama and Mr. Cameron will discuss a range of issues including terrorism, Ebola and Russia's actions in Ukraine, and cyber-security.

The two world leaders are also expected to announce their plans to hold joint cyber "war games" starting later this year with a mock attack on banks.

The British leader has said he plans to ask President Obama to press U.S. technology companies like Google and Facebook to allow governments to snoop on encrypted communications.

The subject is a sensitive one in the U.S. following widespread public outrage at revelations the U.S. National Security Agency was scooping up phone records of millions of Americans. Disclosures by former NSA systems analyst Edward Snowden also showed that several U.S. Internet businesses were giving NSA access to customer data.

The president held a working dinner with the prime minister at the White House Thursday night, a week after Europe was shaken by terror in Paris.
