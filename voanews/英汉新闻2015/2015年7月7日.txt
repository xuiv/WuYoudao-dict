**伊朗核谈判延至星期五**

美国星期二表示，伊朗和六大国同意将伊朗核谈判延长到星期五，为谈判达成最后协议提供更多时间。

美国代表团发言人哈夫说，“我们在各方面都取得了重大进展，但是本星期的工作是高技术性的，对所涉及的所有国家都至关重要。”哈夫还说，“坦率地说， 我们更关注协议的质量而不是时间。 ”

欧盟外交政策专员莫格里尼星期二早些时候说：“我们对最后期限有灵活的解释，这意味着如果最后敲定协议需要时间，需要几天的时间，我们就要花这些时间。”他说，还有几个棘手的问题有待解决。

Iran Nuclear Talks to Continue Through Friday

An interim nuclear agreement between Iran and six major powers will be extended through Friday to provide more time for talks on a final agreement, the United States said Tuesday.

"We have made substantial progress in every area, but this work is highly technical and high stakes for all of the countries involved," said U.S. delegation spokeswoman Marie Harf.

"We are frankly more concerned about the quality of the deal than we are about the clock ..." Harf's statement said.

EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said earlier Tuesday, "We are interpreting in a flexible way our deadline, which means that we are taking the time, the days we still need, to finalize the agreement," adding several difficult issues to resolve remain.

**中国股市早盘下滑 亚洲其他股市回升**

中国股市星期二继续三周以来的下滑。与此同时，在关于希腊债务危机的关键性会议前夕，亚洲市场其他地区大多数股市反弹。

上海综合指数午盘下跌3.2％，与一天前的上涨相反。深圳综合指数下跌5.6％。

这些损失对北京遏制股市暴跌的能力提出新的疑问，中国股市已经蒸发了大约3万亿美元的市值。

中国政府最近宣布了一系列举措，以安抚投资者，其中包括拿出数十亿美元入市，并暂停首次公开募股。

亚洲其他地区多数股市周二回升。东京、悉尼、香港、台北和惠灵顿均有上涨。

投资者正密切注视欧元区领导人周二的紧急会议，债务缠身的希腊预计将在会上提出一个新建议，旨在确保一项国际救助协议。

如果不能尽快达成一项交易可能意味着希腊发生更多债务违约，离开欧盟并停止使用欧元。

Shares Continue Slide in China, Make Gains Elsewhere in Asia

Chinese stocks continued their three-week slide Tuesday, while most of the rest of Asia's markets bounced back ahead of a key meeting on Greece's debt crisis.

The Shanghai Composite Index dropped 3.2 percent by midday, reversing gains from a day earlier, while the Shenzhen Composite Index dropped 5.6 percent.

The losses raise fresh questions about Beijing's ability to contain the stock market plunge, which has already wiped out an estimated $3 trillion in market value.

The government recently announced a series of moves to reassure investors, including pouring billions of dollars into the market and halting initial public offerings.

Elsewhere in Asia, markets mostly recovered Tuesday, with Tokyo, Sydney Hong Kong, Tapei, and Wellington all seeing gains.

Investors are keeping a close watch on Tuesday's emergency meeting of eurozone leaders, where debt-stricken Greece is expected to offer a new proposal aimed at securing an international bailout deal.

Failure to reach a deal soon could mean that Greece defaults on more of its debt, leaves the European Union and discontinues use of the euro currency.
