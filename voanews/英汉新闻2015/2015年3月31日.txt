**马来西亚以煽动罪逮捕五名媒体人士**

马来西亚当局逮捕了一家私营新闻网站的五名雇员，并对他们展开煽动罪调查。看来这是马来西亚政府为压制不同政见及言论自由而采取的最新举措。

《大马内幕者》说，三名编辑、一名发行人和一名经理被逮捕。这显然是因为该网站最近报道说，据称马来西亚政府拒绝采用伊斯兰法规严厉惩罚的一项建议。

警方星期一晚间突击搜查了这家网站的办公室，没收了电脑和其他设备，逮捕了总编莫雷斯、特写编辑苏朗和国内新闻编辑伊斯坎达尔。

《大马内幕者》说，这家网站的发行人塔特和经理沙迪克星期二在警察局接受讯问后，也被拘留。

如被定罪，他们可能面临最高为三年的刑期。

Malaysian Authorities Arrest 5 Newspaper Employees for Sedition

Malaysian authorities have arrested five employees of a private news website and placed them under investigation for sedition, in what is seen as the government's latest attempt at stifling dissent and free speech.

The Malaysian Insider says three editors, a publisher, and a chief executive were arrested, apparently over a recent report that claimed the government had rejected a proposal for allowing tough Islamic law punishments.

Police raided the news portal's offices late Monday, seizing computers and other equipment and arresting three editors: managing editor Lionel Morais, features editor Zulkifli Sulong, and Malay news editor Amin Iskandar.

Publisher Ho Kay Tat and chief executive Jahabar Sadiq were also detained on Tuesday after they showed up to answer questions at a police station, the Insider said.

If found guilty, they could face up to three years in prison.

Challenger Has Lead in Nigeria Presidential Vote

Nigeria's main opposition challenger Muhammadu Buhari has a slight lead over President Goodluck Jonathan in partial returns from the country's presidential election.

The country's electoral commission late Monday announced vote totals from 18 states and the capital, Abuja. It said Mr. Buhari won 10 states while President Jonathan won eight states and the federal capital territory.

Some of Mr. Buhari's victories came in states in southern Nigeria, which is generally considered a stronghold for President Jonathan.

Election chairman Attahiru Jega said more results will be announced on Tuesday. Another 18 states still have to send results to the counting center in Abuja.
