Kerry Fined for Not Shoveling Snow

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has been ticketed $50 for failing to clear the sidewalk outside his Boston home after a snow storm pummeled the northeastern United States this week.

After a blizzard dumped 60 centimeters of snow on his city, Boston Mayor Martin Walsh vowed to crack down on anyone who left the sidewalks around their homes and businesses buried in snow.

On Thursday, officials tagged Kerry with a $50 fine Thursday morning for failing to clear the snow from the side of his Beacon Hill mansion.

Kerry was in Saudi Arabia attending the funeral of King Abdullah with President Barack Obama.

A spokesman for Kerry said the country's top diplomat will promptly pay the fine.

Snow shovelers hired by Kerry finished clearing the sidewalk late Thursday morning.

**奥巴马提议拨款2亿多美元 研究“精准施药”**

奥巴马总统提议向美国一项新的基因研究计划投资2亿一千五百万美元。

奥巴马星期五将提议把这笔钱的大部分拨给美国国家卫生研究院及其下属的美国国家癌症研究所，用于研制”精准施药”，以取代目前所谓“一刀切”的用药办法。

白宫发表声明说，大多数药物都是为“一般病人”设计的，结果对有些病患有效，对有些人无效。

研究人员将用这笔钱来收集100万名志愿者的基因、化学反应、生活方式等数据，研究判断基因差异如何影响到健康和疾病。

这项拨款是奥巴马2016年预算开支计划的一部分。该计划必须得到共和党控制的国会的批准。

奥巴马在最近的国情咨文讲话中说，美国灭了小儿麻痹症，绘制了人类基因组图谱。他希望美国带领世界进入医学研究的新时代。

Obama Wants US to Lead a 'New Era' of Medicine

U.S. President Barack Obama wants to invest $215 million into a new health initiative that would help tailor medical treatment to an individual's genetic make-up.

President Obama will propose Friday the bulk of the money goes to the National Institutes of Health and its affiliate, the National Cancer Institute for the development of "precision medicine;" a treatment that would replace a "one size fits all" approach to medicine.

A White House Statement said "most medical treatments have been designed for the 'average patient'....as a result, treatments can be very successful for some patients, but not for others."

The funding would be used to collect gene, chemical, lifestyle and other data from one million volunteers who would be studied to determine how genetic variants affect health and disease.

But first, the initiative, which is part of the Democratic president's 2016 budget, must be approved by the Republican-controlled Congress.

Mr. Obama said in his recent State of the Union address that he wants "the country that eliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of medicine."
