New Scandal for US Secret Service

Two high-ranking U.S. Secret Service agents are under investigation due allegations they drove a government car into a security barricade at the White House after drinking at a late-night party.

In a story first reported Wednesday by The Washington Post, local police and Secret Service officers were investigating the discovery of a suspicious package near the White House when the agents drove through an entrance that had been closed off.

Officers on the scene wanted to arrest the agents and put them through sobriety tests, according to the Post, but they were ordered by a supervisor to release the pair.

One of the agents has been identified as the second-ranking commander on President Barack Obama's personal security detail.

The investigation is being conducted by the Homeland Security department, which oversees the Secret Service.


**弗格森发生枪击案 两名警察中弹**

星期四凌晨，两名警察在密苏里州弗格森镇遭到枪击。几小时前，弗格森警察局长刚刚辞职。此前美国司法部在一份报告中批评弗格森警察局在执法时带有种族偏见。

其中一名警察隶属圣路易斯警察局，另一名警察来自弗格森附近的一个镇。圣路易斯警察局长贝尔马对记者说，一名警察肩部中弹，另一名警察脸部受伤。关于两名警察的情况，目前还没有官方的说法，但贝尔马表示，这两名警察现在意识清楚，在当地一家医院接受治疗。

贝尔马说，这两名警察之所以遭到枪击，“就是因为他们是警察”。他表示，枪手隐藏在示威人群里。

但弗格森的目击者说，子弹似乎是从警察局对面一座小山上射来的。事件发生后不久，大批警察部署在警察局外面。

星期三，弗格森警察局长杰克逊递交了辞呈。七个月前，白人警察威尔逊在一次街头对峙中开枪打死了没有携带武器的黑人青年布朗。

Two Policemen Shot in Ferguson, Missouri

Two policemen were shot in in Ferguson, Missouri early Thursday morning, hours after the city's police chief resigned in the wake of a Justice Department report accusing the department of racially-biased policing.

One of the officers is a member of the St. Louis County police department, while the other is from a town near Ferguson. St. Louis County police chief Jon Belmar told reporters one officer was shot in the shoulder, while the other was shot in the face. There has been no official word on their condition, but Belmar said the officers were conscious and being treated at a local hospital.

He said the officers were shot "just because they were police officers," and added that the shooter was "somehow embedded" in the group of demonstrators.

But witnesses in Ferguson reported that the shots appeared to come from a hill across the street from the station. A large number of police officers were deployed outside the station moments after the shots rang out.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson submitted his resignation Wednesday, seven months after Darren Wilson, a white police officer fatally shot unarmed black teenager Michael Brown during a street confrontation last August.
