**中日举行四年来的首次高层安全会谈**

中国和日本举行了四年来的首次高层安全会谈，朝着修复双边关系又迈出了一步。由于领土争端，中日两国之间的关系受到严重损害。

中国外长助理和日本副外相星期四在东京举行了一天会谈，双方都表示希望继续改善两国关系。

日本副外相杉山晉辅说：“自去年日中首脑会晤以来，双边关系逐步取得进展，但彼此仍对对方的安全政策存在顾虑。消除顾虑的最佳途径就是进行直接对话。”

中国外长助理刘建超也强调说，中日两国互为重要邻国，而且都是地区强国，因此对话具有重要意义。

自1993年以来，中日两国定期举行包括防务官员在内的会谈，但日本2012年将双方都宣称拥有主权的一些岛屿国有化后，双边会谈被取消。

China, Japan Hold First Security Talks in Four Years

China and Japan have held high-level security talks for the first time in four years, another step toward mending ties that were severely damaged over a territorial dispute.

The deputy foreign ministers of both countries met Thursday in Tokyo for a day of talks, with both sides expressing hope for continued improvement in relations.

"Ties between Japan and China have been making a gradual advance since last year's summit meeting but there still are concerns over each other's security policy," said Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister Shinsuke Sugiyama. "The best way to dissolve concerns is to hold direct dialogue."

Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Liu Jianchao also stressed the importance of dialogue, "as the two sides are important neighbors and regional powers."

The talks, which also included defense officials, had been held regularly since 1993 but were canceled in 2012 after Japan nationalized a group of islands claimed by both countries.
