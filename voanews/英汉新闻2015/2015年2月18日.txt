**安理会召开紧急会议讨论利比亚危机问题**

联合国安理会定于星期三召开紧急会议，讨论利比亚危机问题。目前叙利亚民兵组织和得到国际社会支持的利比亚政府争夺权力和地盘，国家陷于政治动荡之中。

伊斯兰国激进分子在利比亚将21名埃及科普特基督徒斩首后，埃及政府本周开始关注利比亚局势。

埃及外长萨利姆星期二在纽约对记者说，阿拉伯国家的外交官们正在草拟一项决议案，其中将包括防止武器流入民兵手中的措施。自卡扎菲2011年被赶下台以来，利比亚民兵一直得到武器供应。

萨利姆还表示，由于利比亚黎波里和图卜鲁格两个政府并立，利比亚危机的政治解决方案不会根除激进意识形态。预计该决议案不会在星期三提出。

UN Security Council to Hold Emergency Meeting on Libya

The United Nations Security Council is scheduled to hold an emergency session Wednesday on the crisis in Libya, a country that has struggled for political stability while militia groups and an internationally backed government battle for power and territory.

The government in neighboring Egypt directed its attention on the situation this week after Islamic State militants beheaded 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians in Libya.

Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Hassan Shokry Selim told reporters Tuesday in New York that Arab diplomats are working on a resolution that would include measures to halt the flow of weapons to the militias that have persisted since the 2011 ouster of Moammar Gadhafi.

He also said a political settlement in Libya, where parallel governments are operating in Tripoli and Tobruk, will not eradicate militant ideology. The draft resolution is not expected to be presented Wednesday.

**普京吁被困德巴尔切夫的乌克兰军投降**

俄罗斯总统普京呼吁亲俄反政府武装允许被围困的乌克兰军队安全撤离乌克兰东部城镇德巴尔切夫。普京星期二在匈牙利首都发表讲话时，还敦促基辅政府准许其军队投降。

普京发表讲话时，匈牙利总理欧尔班同他在一起。尽管普京和德国、法国以及乌克兰领导人上周宣布达成停火协议，德巴尔切夫的战斗仍在继续。

普京在莫斯科电视台转播的新闻发布会上表示，在2月12号停火协议达成之前“大约一个星期”的时候，乌克兰部队在德巴尔切夫被包围。他还表示他上星期预计包围预示着“无论怎样，双方冲突会持续一段时间。”

但是他说，自从宣布停火之后，乌克兰东部其它地方的战斗已经减少了。

Putin Calls On Ukraine Troops Encircled at Debaltseve to Surrender

Russian President Vladimir Putin is calling on pro-Russian rebels to allow besieged Ukrainian troops safe passage out of the encircled town of Debaltseve in eastern Ukraine. Speaking Tuesday in the Hungarian capital, Mr. Putin also urged the Kyiv government to allow its troops to surrender.

Mr. Putin spoke alongside Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban as fighting raged in Debaltseve, despite an internationally brokered cease-fire announced last week by Mr. Putin and the leaders of Germany, France and Ukraine.

In the news conference, broadcast on Moscow television, Mr. Putin noted that Ukrainian troops were encircled at Debaltseve "about a week before" the truce deal was reached on February 12. He also said that he predicted last week that the encirclement at Debaltseve presaged "one way or another, for some time, that these clashes will continue."

But he said fighting elsewhere in the east had abated since the cease-fire was announced.
