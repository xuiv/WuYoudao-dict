**纽约州警察继续搜捕两越狱杀人犯**

美国纽约州警察星期二继续搜捕两名被定罪的杀人犯，之前有人看见他们星期一夜间冒雨在一条公路步行。

几十名持枪警察星期三在纽约州威尔斯伯罗镇附近的农场和田地搜捕越狱潜逃的大卫·斯威特和理查德·马特。当局认为这两人上星期从靠近加拿大边界的丹尼莫拉镇高度警戒的监狱越狱后徒步逃亡。

警方说，斯威特和马特使用电动工具从牢房一直挖掘到附近大街的地下管道，然后从出口逃出。

人们对此提出疑问：犯人如何获得电动工具以及为什么噪音没有引起监狱看守和其他犯人的注意。

斯威特2002年因杀死一名警长而被判处无期徒刑。马特1997年杀死一名男子后被控谋杀、绑架和抢劫，被判处25年监禁。

纽约州州长安德鲁·科莫说，这两人得以越狱一定得到了其他人的帮助。

Authorities Still Looking for Two Convicted Killers Who Escaped from Prison in Northern New York

Police in New York state searched Tuesday for two convicted killers after they were reported walking along a road in a driving rainstorm the night before.

Dozens of police armed with rifles walked through farms and fields near the town of Willsboro as they tried to apprehend David Sweat and Richard Matt.

Authorities believe the two men are on foot after a daring escape last week from a maximum security prison farther north in Dannemora, located near the Canadian border.

Officials say Sweat and Matt used power tools to carve out their escape route from their cells to a manhole cover in a nearby street.

Questions have been raised about how the inmates obtained the tools, and why the noise did not draw the attention of prison staff or other inmates.

Sweat was serving a life sentence for the 2002 death of a sheriff's deputy. Matt faced 25 years to life in prison on murder, kidnapping and robbery charges following the 1997 killing of a man.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the duo "definitely had help" in their escape.

**希腊总理周三与德法首脑谈判救助希腊经济**

希腊总理齐普拉斯星期三在布鲁塞尔与德国总理默克尔和法国总统奥朗德举行会谈，讨论向债务缠身的希腊提供新的救助资金的问题。

希腊的国际救助项目6月底到期，希腊三个星期后必须有足够的资金履行对国际货币基金组织的还债义务，否则就是债务违约。

希腊星期二向国际债权人提出新的经济改革计划，避免在六月底债务违约。这些债权人是国际货币基金组织、欧洲中央银行和希腊的欧洲邻国。

计划的细节尚未透露，但一些官员说，重点是修订陷入困境的希腊政府的财政目标和增加财政收入的新渠道。

在落实希腊前政府已经同意的经济紧缩改革方面，希腊新的激进左翼政府与国际货币基金组织、欧洲中央银行和欧洲邻国等债权人陷入对立。德国和法国是希腊救助计划的两个最大的出资国。

Greek Prime Minister to Talk Debt With German and French Leaders

Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is scheduled to meet in Brussels Wednesday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande for negotiations on new bailout funds for the debt-ridden country.

Greece has three weeks to come up with enough cash to avoid a default on its obligations to the International Monetary Fund when its international rescue package expires at the end of June.

On Tuesday, Greece offered a new economic reform plan to its international creditors -- the International Monetary fund, the European Central Bank, and Greece's European neighbors.

Details of the new ideas Greece sent to its lenders were not disclosed, but some officials said they focused on revised fiscal targets for Greece's beleaguered government and new ways to generate revenue.

Greece's new radical leftist government is engaged in a standoff with its creditors over implementing ongoing austerity reforms agreed to by earlier Greek governments.

Germany and France are two of the largest single contributors to Greece's bailout package.
