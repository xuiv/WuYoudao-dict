**美国驻韩大使在首尔遇袭受伤 目前状况稳定**

美国驻韩国大使李柏特在首尔遇袭，一名凶手用刀割伤他的脸部和手腕。李柏特星期四说，他目前“状况不错，情绪很好”。

李柏特在医院接受治疗。他在推特上说，众多的支持使他和家人深受感动，并表示他很快就会重新开始工作，致力于促进美韩关系发展。

目击者说，在这起袭击事件发生时，李柏特正在吃早餐，一名男子用一把25厘米长的刀袭击他。警方后来证实，这名男子是55岁的金基宗。

据韩国媒体报道，金基宗当时高喊“韩国朝鲜应当统一”。

几十年来，朝鲜半岛南北两方被世界上警戒最严密的分界线隔开。美国在韩国有2万8500驻军，作为对朝鲜的威慑，而一些韩国人认为美国驻军阻碍了朝鲜半岛统一。

韩国总统朴槿惠说，这起事件是对韩美同盟的攻击。

US Envoy to South Korea 'Doing Well' After Knife Attack

The U.S. ambassador to South Korea said Thursday he is "doing well and in great spirits" after an assailant in Seoul slashed him on the face and wrist with a knife.

Ambassador Mark Lippert was treated at a hospital, and later wrote on Twitter that he and his family were deeply moved by an outpouring of support and that he would soon return to advance U.S.-South Korean relations.

Witnesses said the assault happened as Lippert attended a breakfast and a man police later identified as 55-year-old Kim Ki-Jong attacked the ambassador with a 25-centimeter knife.

South Korean media reported that Kim screamed, "South and North Korea should be reunified."

The rival Koreas have been divided for decades along the world's most heavily armed border. The U.S. has stationed 28,500 troops in South Korea as a deterrent against North Korea, and some South Koreans see the U.S. presence as a barrier toward a unified Korea.

South Korean President Park Geun-hye said the slashing was an "attack on the South Korea-U.S. alliance."


**希拉里·克林顿：希望公众看我的电邮**

由于在担任美国首席外交官期间用个人电邮地址处理公务而受到批评的前美国国务卿希拉里·克林顿说，她已要求国务院发布了她的电子邮件

星期三晚间，克林顿在推特上发出一条短信息：“我希望公众看到我的电邮。我已请国务院公布这些电邮。他们说，将在审查后尽快公布。”

《纽约时报》透露克林顿以个人电邮地址处理公务后，她首次打破沉默。《纽约时报》还说，克林顿可能违反了联邦记录法。这项法律规定政府正式文件必须存档。

美联社星期三发表的一篇报道说，克林顿使用她纽约家里的个人电邮服务器。这使事情更显复杂。

在这一事态的促动下，美国国会众议院负责调查2012年美国驻利比亚城市班加西领馆遇袭事件的特别委员会主席要求法院调阅有关这一事件的克林顿电邮。

Hillary Clinton: 'I Want the Public to See My Email'

Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, under fire for using her personal email address to conduct official business during her tenure as America's top diplomat, says she has asked the State Department to release her emails.

"I want the public to see my email," Clinton said late Wednesday night in a brief Twitter message. "I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible."

Clinton broke her silence on the matter after her use of her personal email address was revealed by the The New York Times, which added that she may have violated federal records laws that require archiving official government documents.

The story took on an added dimension Wednesday when a story published by The Associated Press said Clinton used a personal email server based in her family's home in New York.

The revelations prompted the chairman of the special House of Representatives committee investigating the 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya to subpoena Clinton's emails related to the incident.
