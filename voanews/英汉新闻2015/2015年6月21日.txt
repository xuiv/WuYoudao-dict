**美国家庭周日纪念父亲节**

这个星期天是父亲节，人们在这一天庆祝和赞美父亲的贡献。

每年6月的第三个星期天是美国的父亲节。今年的父亲节恰好是北半球夏季的开始。

父亲节这一天，很多家庭请父亲去餐馆吃饭，并给父亲买礼物, 包括（象笑话里说的那样）太多的领带。经济学者说，美国人每年父亲节买礼物要花费10亿美元。

父亲的起源平凡。1908年7月5日，当时西维吉尼亚州的一个教堂举行星期日礼拜，纪念前一年在煤矿爆炸中遇难的362人。

第二年华盛顿州斯波坎一位由丧偶父亲独自抚养长大的妇女着手推动建立父亲节获得成功。该州1910年首次在全州范围内庆祝父亲节。

第二次大战结束后，父亲节成为美国人普遍庆祝的节日。

US Celebrates Father's Day

Sunday is Father's Day in the United States, an occasion to mark and celebrate the contributions of fathers.

The non-federal holiday is observed each year on the third Sunday in June, which this year, falls on the first day of summer (in the Northern Hemisphere).

Families usually celebrate the day with taking Dad out to dinner and plying him with gifts, including (-as the joke goes-) far too many ties. Economists say Americans spend more than $1 billion each year on Father's Day gifts.

The humble origins of Father's Day began on July 5, 1908 when a (state of) West Virginia church held a Sunday service in memory of 362 men who had died the previous year in explosions in coal mines.

The next year, a Spokane, Washington woman who was raised by her widowed father set out to establish a male equivalent of Mother's Day. She was successful and in 1910 Washington state celebrated the nation's first statewide Father's Day.

By the end of the war, Father's Day was a national institution.
