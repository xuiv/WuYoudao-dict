预计美国总统奥巴马星期二将任命海军陆战队的约瑟夫·邓福德将军接替陆军的邓普西将军，担任参谋长联席会议主席。

邓福德目前担任海军陆战队司令，他去年年底刚刚就任这一职位。从2013年至2014年，现年59岁的邓福德曾担任驻阿富汗美军及国际联军司令，负责实施美军撤离阿富汗以及向阿富汗军队移交安全职责等项任务。在美国军队2003年攻入伊拉克的行动中，邓福德负责指挥海军陆战队作战，被人称为“好斗的乔。”

邓福德是波士顿人，1977年开始担任海军陆战队军官。继现已退役的佩斯将军之后，邓福德将是第二位担任参谋长联席会议主席的海军陆战队将领。佩斯于2005年至2007年担任这一职位。

Obama to Name Top Marine General as Nation's Top Military Officer

U.S. President Barack Obama is expected to name Marine General Joseph Dunford as the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on Tuesday, replacing Army General Martin Dempsey as the nation's top uniformed military advisor.

Dunford currently serves as the Marine's commanding officer, a post he assumed just late last year. The 59-year Dunford previously served as commander of all U.S. and international coalition forces in Afghanistan from 2013 to 2014, overseeing the ongoing withdrawal of U.S. forces and hand over security operations to Afghan forces. He also led Marines' combat team during the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, earning him the nickname "Fighting Joe."

Dunford, a native of Boston, was first commissioned as a Marine officer in 1977. He would be only the second Marine to serve as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, following now-retired General Peter Pace, who held the post from 2005 to 2007.

Thailand King Makes Public Appearance

Thailand's ailing King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world's longest-reigning monarch, has made a rare public appearance to celebrate the 65th anniversary of his coronation.

Television stations in Thailand broadcast live Tuesday as the widely revered 87-year-old king left the Bangkok hospital where he has spent the last several months.

Hundreds of people lining the streets cheered "Long Live the King" as the monarch's motorcade passed on its way to the Grand Palace for a Buddhist ceremony attended by top Thai officials.

The festivities are to mark Coronation Day, a public holiday in Thailand in remembrance of the king's official ascension to the throne on May 5, 1950, three years after his reign began following the death of his brother.

The king, who is now wheelchair-bound, has rarely left the hospital after having his gall bladder removed in October.
