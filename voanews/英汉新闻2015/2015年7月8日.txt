**教宗呼吁为子孙后代保护环境**

罗马天主教宗方济各继续南美之行，星期三在玻利维亚访问。此前，他在厄瓜多尔的两次讲话中敦促信众向穷人伸出援手，并且要为子孙后代保护环境。

教宗在厄瓜多尔首都基多对一些商界领袖和土著部落成员说：“地球的资源是每个人的，不管一个人如何显示他的财产，这种财产都有社会成本。”

教宗上个月发表圣谕，呼吁世界各国领导人立即行动起来，制止气候变化，其中包括结束地球对化石燃料的依赖。教宗在基多的讲话是自那以来首次提到环境问题。

对气候变化持怀疑态度的人、特别是美国国内持这种态度的人对教宗的立场提出尖锐批评。教宗计划今年9月访问美国。保守派指责教宗不了解气候变化，要求他不再提这个问题。

Pope Francis Caps Trip to Ecuador with Calls to Protect Environment

Pope Francis continues his tour of South America in Boliva Wednesday, after urging the faithful to open their arms to the poor and preserve the environment for future generations during a pair of speeches in Ecuador.

The pontiff told a group of business leaders and indigenous tribes in the capital city of Quito that "the goods of the Earth are meant for everyone, and however much someone may parade his property, it has a social mortgage."

His remarks on the environment were the first since he released his encyclical last month calling on world leaders to take immediate action to halt climate change, including ending the Earth's reliance on fossil fuels.

Pope Francis has faced heated criticism among climate change skeptics for his stance, especially in the United States, which he plans to visit in September. Conservatives have denounced him as ill-informed on the issue, and have called on him to drop the issue.

**缅甸确定11月举行全国选举**

缅甸宣布，人们期待已久的全国选举将于11月8号举行。

预计，昂山素季领导的反对党全国民主联盟在选举中将有强势表现。

但军方主导的议会上个月否决了一项宪法改革议案，致使昂山素季本人不能竞选总统。这项议案将旨在结束军方的立法否决权，能更容易修改宪法。

目前的宪法确保军方在议会拥有25个席位，足以阻止军方不喜欢的任何宪法修订。

缅甸宪法禁止任何有外国籍子女的人竞选总统。昂山素季的儿子是英国籍，因此不符合竞选总统条件。

这个决定被视为缅甸政治变革的一次挫折。2011年，统治缅甸数十年的军方将权力交给了一个主要由文官组成的政府，开启了缅甸的政治变革。

Myanmar Sets November National Election Date

Myanmar has announced that the country's long-awaited national election will be held on November 8.

The opposition National League for Democracy, headed by Aung San Suu Kyi, is expected to continue its strong performance at the polls.

But Aung San Suu Kyi will be unable to run for president, after the military-dominated parliament last month rejected a constitutional reform measure. The measure would have ended the army's legislative veto power, making it easier to change the constitution.

Under the current charter, Myanmar's military has 25 guaranteed parliament seats, enough to block constitutional changes it does not like.

The constitution forbids anyone with foreign children from running for president. Aung San Suu Kyi, whose sons are British, is ineligible for the post.

The decision was seen as a setback for Myanmar's political transition, which began in 2011 when the military, which had ruled the country for decades, handed power to a mostly civilian government.
