**缅甸法院以侮辱宗教罪判处三人劳役监禁**

星期二，一个缅甸法院判处一名酒吧经理及其两名同事两年半劳役和监禁。他们的罪名是在一张广告单上使用佛像。法官说，这样做是对佛教的侮辱。

去年12月，这张广告单出现在脸书上，推销维加斯特罗酒吧优惠价饮料和电子音乐，广告单上的佛像色泽浓烈，头戴大型耳机。后来这张广告单被一则道歉启事取代。

仰光的这家法院做出判决，新西兰公民布拉克伍德和两名缅甸人(Tun Thurien 和 Htut Ko Ko Lwin)因侮辱宗教而服两年劳役，并因不服从一名公职人员的命令而入狱半年。

目前，佛教民族主义正在缅甸兴起。

Myanmar Sentences 3 for Insulting Buddhism

A court in Myanmar sentenced a bar manager and two colleagues to two and a half years in prison Tuesday for using an image of Buddha in a flyer that a judge said insulted Buddhism.

The flyer promoting discounted drinks and electronic music at VGastro Bar appeared on the Facebook in December showing Buddha in vibrant colors wearing large headphones. It was later replaced by an apology.

The court in Yangon sentenced Philip Blackwood of New Zealand and Tun Thurien and Htut Ko Ko Lwin of Myanmar to two years of hard labor for insulting religion and another six months for disobeying an order from a public servant.

The case comes as Myanmar is seeing a surge in Buddhist nationalism.


**以色列选举 内塔尼亚胡总理争取连任**

以色列选民星期二前往投票站投票，内塔尼亚胡争取获得第四个总理任期。

最新的选前民调结果显示，在围绕120个议会席位的争夺中，内塔尼亚胡的保守派利库德集团落后于以犹太复国运动联盟领袖艾萨克•赫尔佐克为首的中间偏左联盟。

预计两派都不能赢得作为议会多数所需的61个议席，因此双方激烈争夺较小党派的支持，包括共产党、阿拉伯人领导的政党以及正统犹太党派。

三星期前，内塔尼亚胡罢免了执政联盟的高层伙伴，同时决定在星期二举行选举。分析人士说，此次选举成为对内塔尼亚胡领导成效的全民公决。

在开始投票前，内塔尼亚胡改变了早些时候在巴勒斯坦建国问题上的立场。他星期一说，如果继续担任总理，他绝不支持巴勒斯坦建国。

Netanyahu Seeks Fourth Term as Israelis Vote

Voters are going to the polls Tuesday in Israel where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is seeking a fourth term as prime minister.

The latest pre-election surveys for the 120-member parliament showed Mr. Netanyahu's conservative Likud party trailing a few seats behind a center-left alliance led by Zionist Union leader Isaac Herzog.

With neither candidate expected to win the 61-seat parliamentary majority, there has been a furious campaign push by the candidates to rally support from smaller groups ranging from communist and Arab-led parties to orthodox Jewish blocs.

Mr. Netanyahu called Tuesday's election three months ago when he fired his senior coalition partners. Analysts say these elections have become a referendum on the prime minister's leadership.

Ahead of the voting, Mr. Netanyahu reversed his earlier stance on Palestinian statehood, saying Monday that he will never support a Palestinian state if he remains in office.
