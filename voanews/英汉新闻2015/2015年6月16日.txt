Egyptian Court Upholds Death Sentence for Morsi

An Egyptian court upheld a death sentence Tuesday for former President Mohamed Morsi in connection with a 2011 mass prison break. He was originally sentenced last month along with 100 others.

The same court also sentenced Mr. Morsi to life in prison on Tuesday in a separate case involving charges of conspiring with foreign groups, including the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

Since his 2013 ouster led by then-army chief and current President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, the Egyptian government has brought multiple charges against Mr. Morsi and the leaders of his banned Muslim Brotherhood amid a massive crackdown against the group.

Tuesday's rulings also included a death sentence for Brotherhood leader Mohamed Badie and life in prison for other leaders.

The sentences can be appealed.

US House Approves Resolution Urging Iran to Free Detained Americans

The U.S. House of Representatives has passed, late Monday by a vote of 391-0, a non-binding resolution, calling for Iran to release three American citizens, Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, Pastor Saeed Abedini and Amir Hekmati, who have been held in custody.

Rezaian was arrested last year and is on trial on charges of spying. Abedini has been detained since 2012 for leading Christian worship services. Hekmati, a retired U.S. Marine who was arrested in 2011 while visiting his grandmother, was tried and sentenced to death on espionage charges. His sentence has since been reduced to 10 years.

The resolution also calls for Iran to provide information on former FBI agent Robert Levinson, who disappeared in Iran in 2007.

Congressional lawmakers are pushing Iran to release the Americans as the June 30 deadline approaches for Iran to reach a deal with the United States and five other nations over the Islamic regime's nuclear program.
