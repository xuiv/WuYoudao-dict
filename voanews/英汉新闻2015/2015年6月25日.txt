**中国加强民用船只的军事用途**

中国命令新建民用船只必须适用于某些军事用途。

分析人士说，这一举措有助于加强中国对有争议的东中国海和南中国海的主权声索，同时推动中国军方对海军实力的扩充。

今年早些时候发表的一份美国海军情报说，北京已经将其民用海岸警卫船队扩充为世界上规模最大的同类船队，利用非武装船只加强对有争议水域的主权声索。分析人士据此将中国的民用海岸警卫船队称做“中国的第二海军”。

China Sea Strategy Boosts Military Use of Civilian Ships

China is ordering newly-built civilian ships to comply with military specifications.

Analysts say the move could help bolster China’s efforts to assert its territorial claims in the disputed East and South China seas and add to ongoing efforts by the Chinese military to extend its naval reach.

Beijing has already expanded its civilian coast guard fleet into the largest in the world, using the unarmed ships to help shore up its claims in disputed waters, according to a U.S. naval intelligence report published earlier this year. This has led analysts to call the fleet “China’s Second Navy.”

**希腊与欧盟继续讨论救助计划**

希腊总理齐普拉斯星期四在布鲁塞尔与希腊债权人开始一轮重要会谈，希望达成一项救助协议，使希腊避免下星期债务违约。

星期三希腊与欧元区各国部长的会谈一直持续到星期四早上，但仍没达成任何协议。

希腊下星期二之前必须偿还国际货币基金组织近20亿美元的贷款。为此，希腊需要获得欧盟经济救助计划中80亿美元拨款。

希腊同意改革养老金制度，提高某些销售税，但仍坚持要求欧盟对希腊债务进行重组。

齐普拉斯总理的左翼政府说，削减开支和增税降低了希腊人的生活标准，让希腊人吃尽了苦头。

债务违约会迫使希腊退出欧元区，给欧盟市场带来震动。

Greek Bailout Talks Continue in Brussels

Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has begun Thursday's round of critical talks with Greece's creditors in Brussels, in hopes of achieving a bailout deal to save Athens from default next week.

Wednesday's round of meetings with eurozone ministers ended early on Thursday morning with no deal in place.

Greece must make a nearly $2 billion loan payment to the International Monetary Fund by next Tuesday. To do that, it needs an $8 billion installment of an EU economic bailout.

Although Greece has agreed to reform its pension system and raise certain sales taxes, it is still demanding its debt be restructured by the EU.

Mr. Tsipras' leftist government has said Greeks have suffered enough from spending cuts and tax increases that have lowered their standard of living.

A default could force Greece out of the eurozone and shake up European markets.
