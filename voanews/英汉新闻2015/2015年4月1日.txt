Nigeria's President-elect Buhari: Nation Has "Embraced Democracy"

Nigerian President-elect Muhammadu Buhari says his country has "embraced democracy" and put its one-party state behind it.

Mr. Buhari spoke Wednesday in Abuja, just hours after the electoral commission declared him the official winner of Saturday's presidential election, defeating incumbent Goodluck Jonathan by more than 2 million votes.

Mr. Buhari called Mr. Jonathan "a worthy opponent" and said he extends the "hand of fellowship" to the outgoing president.

President Jonathan's People's Democratic Party has ruled Nigeria since 1999.

Mr. Buhari, of the All Progressives Congress, is to be inaugurated May 29.

Nigeria's Electoral Commission chairman Attahiru Jega announced earlier Wednesday that Mr. Buhari had officially won the election, getting 15.4 million votes to Mr. Jonathan's 12.9 million.
