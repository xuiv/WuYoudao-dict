Pope Francis: Leaks Will Not Stop Church Reforms

Pope Francis says the leaking of sensitive Vatican documents is a "crime" and "a deplorable act" that will not stop him from moving forward with church reforms.

Francis made his remarks before tens of thousand of people at his Sunday blessing in Saint Peter's Square.
