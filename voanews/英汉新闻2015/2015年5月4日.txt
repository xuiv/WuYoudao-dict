**又有三名美国共和党人参加总统竞选**

又有三名美国共和党人本星期加入2016年总统选举不断增加的参选人行列。

本·卡森星期日接受采访时说，他将争取共和党总统候选人提名。卡森计划星期一在底特律正式宣布参选。

两年前，卡森在一次演讲中批评奥巴马总统的医保方案，并因此而得名。但他将该医保方案与奴役制相提并论，并对同性恋发表负面评论，从而招致批评。

星期一，前惠普公司总裁卡利·菲奥利纳也将宣布参选。麦凯恩参议员2008年竞选总统时，菲奥利纳担任他的经济问题顾问，从中获得一些参与全国政治活动的经验，她本人曾于2010年竞选美国参议员。

2008年的总统参选人、前阿肯色州州长赫克比计划在星期二宣布参选。

Three More Republicans Set to Join US Presidential Race

The field for the 2016 U.S. presidential election continues to grow with three prominent Republicans entering the race this week.

Ben Carson said in an interview Sunday he will run in the already crowded competition for his party's nomination. He planned a formal announcement at an event Monday in Detroit.

Carson rose to prominence two years ago with a speech criticizing President Barack Obama's landmark health care initiative, but has also drawn criticism for equating that program to slavery and for comments about homosexuality.

Also Monday, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina was due to announce her candidacy. She has some experience in national politics having served as an economic advisor to Senator John McCain during the 2008 presidential race he lost to Mr. Obama, as well as her own failed 2010 bid for a U.S. Senate seat.

Another candidate from 2008, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, plans to join the race on Tuesday.


**习近平会见朱立伦**

中国国家主席、中共中央总书记习近平与到访的台湾执政党国民党主席朱立伦举行会谈，讨论继续发展两岸关系的问题。

朱立伦星期一在北京人民大会堂会晤习近平之前表示，他希望台海两岸将继续致力于地区和平，并在环保和经济等领域进行合作。

朱立伦可能是明年台湾总统选举的候选人，他没有谈及中国在有争议的斯普拉特利群岛修建简易机场和基础设施的问题。中国的几个邻国和台湾也宣称对该群岛拥有主权，包括菲律宾和越南。

朱立伦星期日在上海会见了中共中央政治局常委俞正声。俞正声暗示，双方的讨论涉及台湾在亚洲基础设施投资银行中的地位。

中国希望台湾加入亚投行，但不用目前的名称，因为这会表明台湾岛是一个独立的国家。

China, Taiwan Discuss Relations

Chinese President Xi Jinping has met with Eric Chu, the visiting head of Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party, to discuss the continuing development of cross-Taiwan Strait relations. Mr. Xi is also the head of China's Communist Party.

Chu said before the meeting at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing Monday that he hopes Taiwan and China will continue to work for peace in the region and cooperate on issues such as environment and economy.

Chu, who is a likely presidential candidate in Taiwan next year, did not mention China's building of air strips and infrastructure in the disputed Spratley Islands, which are also claimed by several of China's neighbors, including Taiwan, the Philippines and Vietnam.

Chu met Sunday with China's Politburo Standing Committee member Yu Zhengsheng in Shanghai. Yu suggested discussions related to Taiwan's role in the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.

China wants Taiwan to participate, but not under its name, which would suggest the island is an independent country.
