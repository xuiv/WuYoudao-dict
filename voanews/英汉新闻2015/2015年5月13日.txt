**克里: 现在是结束乌克兰冲突的关键时刻**

美国国务卿克里说，现在是俄罗斯和亲俄分离分子履行和平协议结束乌克兰东部暴力的“关键时刻”。

克里在土耳其城市安塔利亚做出上述表示。他星期三在安塔利亚会见了北约成员国外长。

星期二，克里在俄罗斯度假城市索契会见了俄罗斯总统普京和外长拉夫罗夫。克里在俄罗斯说，对于乌克兰和叙利亚武装冲突等复杂的全球性问题，必须由关键的决策者们进行直接会谈，除此之外别无他途。

在克里此次出访之际，华盛顿和莫斯科的关系由于双方在乌克兰和叙利亚问题上存在分歧而陷于后冷战时期的低谷，看来这次访问的主要目的之一就是保持美俄两国的接触。

星期二发表的一份报告说，过去一年期间至少有220名俄罗斯军人在乌克兰东南部地区战死。这份报告是根据被暗杀的俄罗斯反对派领袖涅姆佐夫搜集的信息撰写的。

莫斯科曾屡次否认介入乌克兰冲突。

Kerry: Now is "Critical Moment" for Ukraine Conflict

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry says now is a "critical moment" for Russia and pro-Russia separatists to fulfill a peace deal meant to end violence in eastern Ukraine.

Kerry made the comment in Antalya, Turkey, where he met Wednesday with NATO foreign ministers.

Kerry's comments follow meetings Tuesday with Russia's President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in the Russian resort city of Sochi. Kerry in Russia said there is "no substitute" for direct talks with key decision makers on complex global issues such as the conflicts in Ukraine and in Syria.

Kerry's trip came at a time when relations between Washington and Moscow have plummeted to post-Cold War lows amid the disagreements over Ukraine and Syria, and the trip appeared designed as much to maintain contact as anything else.

Also Tuesday, a report was released based on information compiled by slain Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov that said at least 220 Russian soldiers have died in fighting in southeastern Ukraine over the past year.

Moscow has repeatedly denied claims it is involved in the conflict.


**法国总统奥朗德访问前殖民地海地**

法国总统奥朗德星期二抵达海地访问，承诺帮助这个贫穷的加勒比国家从2010年地震中恢复，那次地震使海地大部分地区变成废墟。

这是法国总统首次对海地进行正式访问。在1804年之前，海地一直是法国殖民地中的佼佼者。海地发生奴隶暴动后，1804年成为世界上第一个独立的黑人国家。

但海地目前是西半球最贫穷的国家，部分原因是按照1825年签订的协议，海地被迫向法国赔偿暴动造成的土地及奴隶损失，赔款数额相当于现在的190亿美元。

在海地太子港战神广场外有一小批人聚集，抗议奥朗德的到访，要求法国归还迫使海地支付的这笔钱。

本周早些时候，在法国加勒比瓜德罗普岛短暂停留期间，奥朗德曾承认法国对海地“欠债”，但法国官员随后坚持说，奥朗德指的是“道义”债务，而不是金钱债务。

French President Hollande Makes Visit to Former Colony Haiti

French President Francois Hollande visited Haiti Tuesday and pledged to help the impoverished Caribbean nation recover from the 2010 earthquake that left much of the island in ruins.

The trip is the first official state visit by a French president to Haiti, the former crown jewel of French colonialism until 1804, when it became the world's first independent black republic after a slave revolt.

But Haiti is now the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere, due in part to an 1825 agreement that forced Haiti to pay France compensation for land and slaves lost in the rebellion - a sum now estimated to be as much as $19 billion.

A small crowd gathered outside the Champ de Mars to protest Mr. Hollande's trip, demanding France return the money it forced Haiti to pay.

During a stopover on the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe earlier this week, Mr. Hollande admitted that France owed Haiti a "debt," but officials later insisted he was referring to a "moral" debt, instead of a financial one.
