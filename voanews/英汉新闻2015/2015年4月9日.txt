**联合国呼吁为朝鲜提供人道援助**

联合国呼吁为面临粮食危机的众多朝鲜人提供1亿1100万美元援助。

联合国朝鲜人道事务协调员伊萨克扎伊对美国之音记者贝希尔说，这笔款项将帮助在当地工作的五个联合国救援机构2015年继续为朝鲜人提供食品、洁净水和其他基本生活用品。

联合国说，70%的朝鲜人口，也就是1800万朝鲜人面临粮食短缺，而且缺乏多样化营养。

伊萨克扎伊表示，在这些人当中，将近200万人亟需食品救援，其中大多数是儿童、孕妇、哺乳期妇女和老年人，此外还有35万妇女和儿童需要疫苗和保健用品。

UN Appeals for $111m for North Korea Aid

The United Nations has launched an appeal for $111 million to help a vast portion of North Korea's population now facing a food crisis.

U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator for North Korea Ghulam Isaczai told VOA's Margaret Besheer the funding will help five U.N. aid agencies working on the ground to continue providing North Koreans with food, clean water and other basics in 2015.

The United Nations says 70 percent of the population, or 18 million North Koreans, are food insecure and lack nutritional diversity.

But Isaczai said of those, nearly 2 million, mostly children, pregnant and lactating women and the elderly, are in dire need of food assistance, and another 350,000 women and children need vaccines and health supplies.

**美国防部长: 平壤试射导弹显示局势危险**

美国国防部长卡特说，平壤最近试射导弹提醒人们注意朝鲜半岛非常危险的局势。卡特是星期四抵达韩国的。

在离开日本前往韩国之前，卡特在横田空军基地对记者说，如果朝鲜发射导弹是送给他的“欢迎信号”，他会感到“荣幸”。

朝鲜本星期向其西部沿海发射了短程导弹。上星期五，朝鲜在一次类似的试射中发射了四枚导弹。

当美国官员访问该地区之前，或平壤与韩国之间的关系趋于紧张之际，朝鲜经常会试射导弹。

星期四，韩国国防部将朝鲜本星期试射导弹称为“例行公事”，并表示此举并不构成对韩国安全的严重威胁。

韩国官员还说，朝鲜试射导弹看来是对美韩举行代号为“雏鹰”的联合军演做出的反应。

Ashton Carter : North Korea Missile Tests Reminder of Danger

U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter, who arrived in South Korea on Thursday, says Pyongyang's recent missiles tests are a reminder of how dangerous the situation is on the Korean peninsula.

Speaking at Yokota Air Base in Japan before departing for South Korea, Carter told reporters he was "flattered" if the North Korean missile launches were meant to be a "welcome message" for him.

The short-range missiles were launched this week into the sea off North Korea's west coast. North Korea also fired four missiles in a similar test last Friday.

It is not unusual for the North to conduct such tests ahead of visits to the region by U.S. officials or during moments of heightened tension with its foe, South Korea.

Seoul's defense ministry on Thursday called this week's test routine and said the projectiles did not represent a serious security threat to South Korea.

South Korean officials have also said the launches appear to be a response to the ongoing Foal Eagle joint military exercise between the U.S. and South Korea.
