**布隆迪选举委员会建议推迟大选**

布隆迪的选举委员会建议推迟举行大选。 之前布隆迪总统恩库仑齐扎决定寻求第三个任期，引起动乱。

全国独立选举委员会星期一建议6月26日进行国民议会选举，7月15日举行总统选举，7月24日举行参议院选举。

总统选举原定6月26日举行，但在发生暴力抗议和上个月发生未遂政变之后，候选人没有展开竞选活动。

一些反对派人士说， 选举委员会没有法定权力来宣布推迟大选，因为该委员会的5名成员中已有两人逃到国外。

布隆迪爆发抗议示威以来已有10万人出逃。

恩库仑齐扎总统的支持者说， 他寻求第三个任期是合法的，因为他2005年第一次出任总统是由议会、而不是由选民选举的。布隆迪宪法法院支持总统寻求连任。

但批评者说，恩库仑齐扎的做法违法了宪法有关总统任期的规定和布隆迪内战结束时签署的阿鲁巴协议。

美国呼吁恩库仑齐扎不要竞选第三次连任，称这样做会破坏布隆迪稳定。

Burundi Elections

Burundi's electoral commission has recommended pushing back national elections, after unrest sparked by President Pierre Nkurunziza's decision to seek a third term.

The National Independent Election Commission said Monday it has proposed legislative polls to take place on June 26, followed by the presidential election on July 15 and a senatorial vote on July 24.

The presidential election originally was set for June 26, but there has been no campaigning in the wake of violent protests and a failed coup attempt last month in the capital, Bujumbura.

Some opposition officials said the electoral commission lacks the legal authority to make any pronouncements because two of its five commissioners are believed to have fled the country.

More than 100,000 Burundians have fled the country since the protests began.

The president's supporters say he is eligible for a third term because he was elected by parliament, not voters, for his first five-year term in 2005. The constitutional court has ruled in favor of the president.

But his critics say that by running for a third term, he is violating term limits in the constitution and the accords that ended Burundi's civil war.

The United States has called on Mr. Nkurunziza not to run for a third term, saying the decision could destabilize Burundi.

**南卡大陪审团起诉打死黑人的警官**

美国南卡罗来纳州的一个大陪审团对开枪打死黑人的一名白人警察提出起诉。被打死的黑人开车被警察拦下检查时企图逃离现场, 他当时并没有携带武器。

白人警察迈克尔·斯拉格尔今年4月开枪打死50岁的沃尔特·斯科特之后被解雇并被控谋杀。斯拉格尔因为斯科特驾驶的车辆刹车灯故障而命令他停车。

一个旁观者用手机拍摄的视屏显示，斯科特企图逃离现场，警察斯拉格尔向他连开8枪。斯拉格尔最初说，他和斯科特发生扭打，斯科特抢走了他的电棍。

如果罪名成立，斯拉格尔有可能被判处30年徒刑，甚至是无期徒刑，不得假释。

美国最近发生多起未携带武装黑人死于白人警察之手的事件，南卡的枪击案是其中之一。

这些事件引发了全美各地的大规模抗议示威。 人们抗议警察在少数族裔社区过度使用警力的做法。美国司法部已对一些案件展开调查，看警察是否侵犯了公民权利。

South Carolina Police Shooter indited

A South Carolina grand jury has indicted a white former police officer who shot and killed an unarmed black man fleeing after a traffic stop.

Michael Slager was fired and accused of murder in the April 4 killing of 50-year-old Walter Scott. Slager pulled Scott over for driving with a broken brake light.

A video, taken by a bystander with a cellphone camera, showed Scott running away as Slager pulls his gun and fires eight shots. Slager initially said he opened fire after Scott had taken his electronic stun gun during a scuffle

Slager faces between 30 years and life in prison without the possibility of parole if convicted.

The South Carolina incident is one of the latest in a series of fatal encounters in the United States between unarmed black males and white police.

The incidents led to large protests across the nation over aggressive police tactics in minority communities.

The U.S. Justice Department has launched investigations into possible civil rights violations by police in a number of the cases.
