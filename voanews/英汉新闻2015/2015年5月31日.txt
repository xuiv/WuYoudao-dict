**美国秘密监控项目去留决战**

星期天，美国将迎来有关国家安全秘密监控项目去留问题的政治决战。对这个项目持批评态度的一名重量级参议员说，他将力促这项授权监听恐怖嫌疑分子电话的法律过期。

有望成为共和党2016年总统大选候选人的参议员兰德·保罗星期六说，当参议院罕见地提前一天结束休会，在星期天开会的时候，他将使用所允许的立法规则来阻碍参议院加快进行有关延长现行法律的讨论，或批准已在众议院通过的改革议案。美国有关国家安全监控现行法律即将在星期天午夜过期。

美国总统奥巴马强烈敦促参议院批准已在众议院通过的《美国自由法案》。这项法案如果最终获得通过，将结束大量搜集美国民众电话记录的活动，但允许美国国家安全局根据具体情况查询电信公司拥有的记录。奥巴马说，只有一小群参议员阻挠法案的通过。

Showdown on US Surveillance Programs

The U.S. is headed to a Sunday showdown over its clandestine national security surveillance programs, with a key Senate critic saying he will force the expiration of the law that authorizes monitoring of domestic calls made by suspected terrorists.

Senator Rand Paul, a 2016 Republican presidential hopeful, says he will use legislative rules allowing him to block efforts to expedite debate on extending the U.S. law that expires at midnight Sunday, Washington time, or approve reforms that have already cleared the House of Representatives.

U.S. President Barack Obama is strongly urging the Senate to approve the House-passed USA Freedom Act that would end bulk collection of Americans’ phone records, but let the NSA search the records held by phone companies on a case-by-case basis - a reform he said is only being blocked by "a handful of senators."
