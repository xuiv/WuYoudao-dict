**中印举行第18轮边界谈判**

印度和中国星期一开始在新德里举行第18轮边界谈判，争取解决长期以来的领土争端。

自印度总理莫迪去年就任以来，这是中印两国首次就实际控制线问题展开谈判。

长期以来，中国和印度一直存在激烈的领土争端。沿实际控制线一带，双方经常发生小规模冲突。中印之间的实际边界穿越喜马拉雅山脉，长达四千公里，包括大片荒无人烟的地区。

中国宣称对喜马拉雅山脉东侧的约九万平方公里土地拥有主权，但印度对此持有异议。这片土地的相当一部分是印度的阿鲁纳恰尔邦。

去年，印度和中国结束了在该地区持续两周的紧张对峙。

1962年，中印边界争端导致这两个亚洲最大国家之间爆发了一场短暂的战争。

India, China Hold Border Talks

India and China began an 18th round of border talks in New Delhi Monday in an effort to resolve a longstanding territorial dispute.

The talks about the Line of Actual Control are the first since Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi came into office last year.

The two countries have long been embroiled in the bitter territorial dispute. Small incursions occur frequently across the Line of Actual Control; the de-facto border that runs 4,000 kilometers across the Himalayas and involves large swathes of remote territory.

China claims around 90,000 square kilometers of land in the eastern Himalayas, which India disputes. A good portion of the land is the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh.

Last year, India and China resolved a tense, two-week military standoff in the region.

The border dispute led to a brief war between Asia's largest countries in 1962.

克鲁兹2013年当选参议员，持保守立场的茶党对他看好。他主张取消奥巴马总统的健保法以及裁撤国税局和教育部。

Ted Cruz Announces Candidacy for US President

Texas Senator Ted Cruz announced Monday he is running for U.S. president in the country's 2016 election.

Cruz had hinted he would formally launch his bid for the Republican Party nomination, and made it official in a message and video on his Twitter account just after midnight Monday.

"I believe in America and her people, and I believe we can stand up and restore our promise," Cruz says in the campaign ad, appealing to what he calls "a new generation of conservatives."

The 44-year-old first term senator is the first high-profile Republican candidate to formally join the race. Several other Republican contenders are expected to follow in the coming weeks.

Cruz, who joined the Senate in 2013 is a favorite of the conservative Tea Party. He wants to repeal President Barack Obama's health care law, abolish the tax-collecting Internal Revenue Service and scrap the Education Department.
