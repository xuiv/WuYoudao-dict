Obama: US Rhetoric Against Syrian Refugees Needs to Stop'

U.S. President Barack Obama has criticized American politicians for opposing the resettlement of Syrian refugees, saying their rhetoric is contrary to American values and could become a recruitment tool for the Islamic State militant group.

Since the terrorist attacks in Paris, some Republican politicians have called for a halt to all resettlements of Syrian refugees, or for only allowing Christian Syrian refugees into the United States, arguing those steps would prevent Syrian terrorists from carrying out similar attacks on the United States.

Speaking to reporters at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Manila Wednesday, Obama said "we are not well served when in response to a terrorist attack we descend into fear and panic."

Republican lawmakers have called for a halt to plans to resettle an additional 10,000 Syrians in the United States.
