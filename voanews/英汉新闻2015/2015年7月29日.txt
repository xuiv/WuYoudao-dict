**法国警方阻截两千名试图进入英国的移民**

法国北部港口城市加来的有关当局说，警方星期一夜间阻截了2千多名试图从欧洲隧道进入英国的移民。

欧洲隧道的管理官员说，以往六个星期来，数千名难民试图从欧洲隧道进入英国，而这次的人数最多。自6月中旬以来，据报有八名移民死在欧洲隧道中。

多达1万名来自非洲、中东和其他地区的移民居住在加来城内和附近，他们的居住环境非常恶劣。加来有七万人口。

观察人士说，由于当局加强了港口安全警戒，使移民无法乘船前往英国，因此几星期来移民们更加急于进入这条50公里长的海底隧道。

警方与移民的对峙导致欧洲隧道的运作星期二出现严重延误。

French Police Block 2,000 Britain-Bound Migrants from Eurotunnel

Authorities in the northern French port city of Calais say police late Monday pushed back more than 2,000 migrants trying to enter the Eurotunnel in hopes of reaching Britain.

Eurotunnel officials described the migrant push as the largest of several such attempts by thousands of refugees to gain entry into Britain in the past six weeks. Eight migrant deaths have been reported at the tunnel since mid-June.

As many as 10,000 migrants from Africa, the Middle East and beyond are living in squalid encampments in and near Calais, a city of 70,000.

Observers say their push to enter the 50-kilometer undersea tunnel has intensified in recent weeks, after authorities stepped up port security to block migrants from stowing away on Britain-bound vessels.

The tunnel confrontation - the second such faceoff between police and migrants in the past two days - caused major delays in Eurotunnel service for much of Tuesday.

Turkey Bombs Kurdish Rebel Targets

Turkey carried out more airstrikes overnight against Kurdish rebels, the prime minister's office said Wednesday,

while the country's parliament prepared to hold a special session to debate the military's campaign against the fighters and Islamic State militants in Iraq.

The airstrikes targeted six Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) locations in southeast Turkey and northern Iraq.

The statement also said authorities had detained more than 1,300 people in Turkey in raids against suspected members of the PKK, the Islamic State and other militant groups.

Ahead of the parliament meeting, the leader of the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party Selahattin Demirtas called for an immediate halt to the fighting.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Tuesday that Turkey would take "no steps back" in what he called a fight against terrorism.

His comments came the same day that NATO held an emergency session and issued a statement condemning terrorist attacks against Turkey and pledging solidarity with the country.
