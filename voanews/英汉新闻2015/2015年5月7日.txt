**成都官员造访优步办公处**

中国成都市的官员访问了优步公司（Uber）的办公处，看来有关当局扩大了对出租车移动招车服务的调查范围。

成都市交通运输委员会发言人说，有关官员星期三访问期间进行了采访并搜集信息。她没有提供其他细节。

上星期，警方突击搜查了广州的优步办公处。中国国家媒体报道说，有关官员在调查优步是否合法注册。

优步在九个中国城市运作，包括北京和上海。但优步的用户大大少于其中国竞争对手，如快的打车和滴滴打车。

中国互联网巨头百度去年宣布，该公司收购了优步股份，但未透露细节。优步的市值为400亿美元。

优步在一些国家陷入法律诉讼，该公司被控进行不公平竞争。对优步的不满还涉及一些未经正确审核的司机。

China Expands Investigation Into Uber

Chinese officials in the southwestern city of Chengdu have visited the offices of Uber, as part of what appears to be a widening investigation into the mobile taxi-hailing service.

A spokeswoman with Chengdu's transportation commission says officials conducted interviews and gathered information during the Wednesday visit. She provided no other details.

Last week, police raided Uber offices in the southern city of Guangzhou. State media reported that officials there were investigating whether the company was properly licensed.

Uber operates in nine Chinese cities, including Beijing and Shanghai. However, it has far fewer users than its domestic rivals, such as Kuaidi Dache and Didi Dache.

The Chinese Internet giant Baidu last year announced it was buying an undisclosed stake in the U.S.-based taxi app operator, which is valued at $40 billion.

Uber is battling lawsuits in a string of countries for unfair competition. Complaints have also arisen concerning drivers who are not properly vetted.

**克里会见也门总统哈迪**

美国国务卿克里星期四与也门总统哈迪举行了会谈，他表示这次会谈“具有建设性”。克里目前正在沙特阿拉伯访问，讨论一项有关出于人道主义考虑而暂停沙特领导的也门境内空袭行动的建议。

三月末，胡塞武装从也门首都萨那向南部海岸地区发动攻势，哈迪逃到沙特，沙特战机对胡塞反政府武装进行空袭。但救援组织抱怨说，向也门境内的平民运送食品和其他必需品已经变得很困难。

克里星期三表示，在暂停空袭期间，任何一方都不得试图占领更多地区，也不能对那些暂时放下武器的人发动袭击。

克里说：“我们已经敦促所有各方遵守人道主义法规，采取一切预防措施，让平民百姓能够远离战火、不受到战事的伤害，并且提供机会，让人道救援得以运送到当地。”

星期四，克里将会晤沙特新任外长阿祖贝尔和萨勒曼国王。

Kerry Holds 'Constructive' Talks with Yemen's President

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry held what he described as "constructive" talks Thursday with Yemen's President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi, as he visits Saudi Arabia for talks on a proposed

humanitarian pause in the Saudi-led airstrikes in Yemen.

Mr. Hadi fled to Saudi Arabia in late March as Houthi fighters advanced from the capital, Sana'a, to the southern coast in an offensive that prompted Saudi warplanes to bomb the rebels.

But aid groups have complained about difficulties in getting food and other needed items to civilians in Yemen.

Kerry said Wednesday that any pause in the air campaign must be carried out in a way that does not allow anyone to try to grab more territory or attack those who have temporarily put down their weapons.

"We have urged all sides, anybody involved, to comply with humanitarian law and to take every precaution to keep civilians out of the line of fire, out of harm's way as well as to provide the opportunity for humanitarian assistance to be able to be delivered," Kerry said.

He was also due to meet Thursday with new Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir and with King Salman.
