Another China Chemical Plant Explosion Kills 1

An explosion at a chemical factory in eastern China has killed at least one person, according to government-run media, the latest in a series of deadly warehouse blasts that have raised questions about insufficient safety regulations.

Pictures on Chinese social media showed a large fireball rising from what appeared to be an industrial area in Dongying, located in the eastern province of Shandong province late Monday.

A news website run by the local government reported the explosion occurred at the Shandong Binyuan Chemical Company. The fire was extinguished five hours later, it said.

The news outlet added that several of the company's executives have been detained and the cause of the fire is under investigation.

The incident comes less than a month after a much larger explosion killed 158 people at a chemical storage facility in the northern port city of Tianjin. Chinese authorities have detained 12 company employees and 11 government officials in that investigation.

UN: Satellite Photos Confirm Destruction of Second Ancient Syrian Temple in Palmyra

The United Nations says satellite photos confirm Islamic State blew up another ancient temple in the historic Syrian city of Palmyra.

A U.N. agency posted images of the Temple of Bel taken on August 27 and the same site taken Monday - one day after Syrian observers said the temple had been destroyed

But Syria's antiquities director Maamoun Abdulkarim said he believes at least part of the temple is still standing. He said Monday there had been a big explosion at the site, but that no one has been able to get close enough yet to confirm how much, if any, of the temple survived.

The Temple of Bel is nearly 2,000 years old and Syrians consider it to be one of the country's most important religious shrines.
