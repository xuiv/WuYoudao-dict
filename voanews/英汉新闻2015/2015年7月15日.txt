**中国第二季度经济增长率7%, 稳定适度**

中国星期三公布的官方数据显示，中国经济上季度的增长速度略高于预期。

中国今年第二季度的经济增长率为7%，与上季度持平。自2009年初世界金融危机后，这是中国经济最低的季度增长率。

中国国家统计局发言人盛来运说，中国国民经济今年上半年的表现是在合理范围内，各项主要指标逐渐改善，趋于稳定和健康的发展。

近年来，作为世界第二大经济体的中国经过连续30年的两位数增长后，经济增长速度迅速下滑。

最近，中国被迫采取重大措施来稳定股市。仅在数周内，中国股市缩水将近30%。

China GDP Growth Holds Steady at Modest 7%

China's economy grew at a slightly faster than expected pace in the latest quarter, according to official data released by Beijing on Wednesday.

The second quarter growth rate of 7 percent is equal to that of the previous quarter, but is China's slowest quarterly rate of expansion since early 2009 following the global financial crisis.

"China's national economic performance in the first half of this year is within a reasonable range, with major indicators improving gradually and trending a stable and healthy development," said National Bureau of Statistics spokesman Sheng Laiyun.

The world's second-largest economy has seen an unexpectedly quick economic downturn in recent years, following three decades of breakneck, double-digit growth.

Most recently, China had to take drastic measures to reverse a stock market crash that had wiped out nearly 30 percent of market value in a matter of weeks.


**中国当局在鄂尔多斯逮捕20名外国游客**

中国逮捕了20名外国游客。一个总部设在南非的宗教人道主义救援组织星期三说，这些游客是在该组织的赞助下前往中国的。

这个南非慈善组织“施予者的礼物”（Gift of the Givers）在脸书上发表声明说，10名南非人、九名英国人和一名印度人上星期五在中国内蒙鄂尔多斯机场被逮捕。

声明说，11名游客已经获释，其他九人仍被拘留，理由是他们观看宣传录像，但中国当局没有对他们提出起诉。

声明说，中国当局试图为拘留这些外国游客找出理由，暗示他们与一个被取缔的恐怖组织有关联，并声称他们在旅馆房间里观看宣传录像。

该慈善组织说，这些外国游客与恐怖组织并无关联，在本国也没有犯罪记录，只是参加了为期47天的“探索古老中国”之旅。

Group: China Arrests 20 Foreign Tourists For Watching 'Terror Video'

China has arrested 20 foreign tourists who were traveling the country as part of a trip sponsored by a South Africa-based religious humanitarian organization, the group said Wednesday.

In a Facebook post, the Gift of the Givers organization said the 10 South Africans, nine Britons, and one Indian national were arrested at the Erdos Airport in China's Inner Mongolia on Friday.

Eleven of the tourists have been released, the statement said, adding nine others remain detained without charge for watching unspecified propaganda videos.

"The Chinese, now trying to find reasons for the detention suggested that some members were linked to a terror group, to a banned organization, to watching propaganda videos in their hotel room," the statement said.

The disaster relief agency, which says it has worked in 41 countries, says the tourists had no terror links and no criminal record in their country, but were part of a 47-day tour "to explore ancient China."
