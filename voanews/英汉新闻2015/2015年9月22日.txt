**教宗结束古巴之旅，前往美国**

罗马天主教教宗方济各星期二启程前往美国。之前不久他在圣地亚哥主持了在古巴的第三场也是最后一场弥撒。他敦促古巴人重新找回他们的天主教传统，让他们生活在“转变的柔情“中。

方济各在古巴最神圣的慈善圣母大教堂主持弥撒时讲了这番话，古巴总统劳尔·卡斯特罗也在场。

古巴在1959年革命之后，一个无神论者和一个试图取代教会在人们生活中的指引力量的共产主义政府上台。教宗布道时的这番话是他在为期四天的行程中对古巴体制提出的一系列谨慎批评中最新的言论。

在星期一参观慈善圣母大教堂时，教宗祈祷无论在国内还是海外的所有古巴人和解。

Pope Ends Cuba Trip, on to US

Pope Francis headed for the United States Tuesday, shortly after celebrating a third and final Mass in Santiago, Cuba, urging Cubans to rediscover their Catholic heritage and live a “revolution of tenderness."

Francis spoke at a Mass at the Basilica of the Virgin of Charity of El Cobre, the country's holiest shrine, with President Raul Castro attending.

The pope's homily in a country whose 1959 revolution installed an atheist, communist government that sought to replace the church as a guiding force in people's lives was the latest in a series of carefully worded critiques of the Cuban system during his four-day trip.

During a visit to the shrine Monday, the pope prayed for reconciliation among all Cubans, both at home and around the world.

**克里：叙利亚的俄罗斯飞机是用于“部队保护”**

美国国务卿克里说，美国军方专家相信俄罗斯派往叙利亚一个空军基地的飞机是用于基本的“部队保护”，目的是要保护已经在那里的俄罗斯地面部队和军备。

但是克里星期二仍不清楚俄罗斯在叙利亚加强军事部署的长期意图。他说，如果俄罗斯是要寻找在中东地区的势力范围，其支持一个实施暴行的叙利亚政府的做法便十分令人奇怪。

俄罗斯曾表示希望打败伊斯兰国，但是拒绝加入美国领导的、有着相同目标的联盟。

克里说，他希望俄罗斯和叙利亚的另一个主要盟友伊朗，做好准备为叙利亚的和平而努力。

联合国的叙利亚问题特使米斯图拉星期二再次为叙利亚的和平谈判展开努力。他宣布了四个“专题”工作组，分别着眼于叙利亚的政治、法律、军事和反恐问题，并要求叙利亚各政党在这些小组内参与讨论。

2012年就叙利亚问题的日内瓦公报提出了民主过渡的路线图，这仍是和平解决问题的基础。

根据该公报，在举行民主选举之前由一个临时政府执政。美国已经表示叙利亚的未来没有阿萨德的位置。

Kerry: Russian Planes in Syria for 'Force Protection'

Secretary of State John Kerry says U.S. military experts believe the Russian planes sent to an air base in Syria are there for basic "force protection," intended to protect Russian soldiers and assets already on the ground.

But Kerry said Tuesday it is still not clear what Russia's long-term intentions are for boosting its military presence in Syria. He said if Russia is looking for a sphere of influence in the Middle East, it is going about it in a very odd way, by backing a Syrian government responsible for atrocities.

Russia has said it wants to defeat Islamic State, but has refused to join the U.S.-led coalition that shares the same goal.

Kerry said he hopes Russia and Iran - another major Syrian ally - are prepared to work for peace in Syria.

The United Nations envoy on Syria launched another effort Tuesday to open peace talks on Syria. Staffan de Mistura announced the heads of four "thematic" working groups. The plan calls for Syrian parties to participate in discussions within the groups looking at political and legal issues, military matters and counterterrorism.

The 2012 Geneva Communique on Syria sets out a road map for a democratic transition and remains the basis for a peaceful settlement.

It includes an interim government ahead of a democratic election. But the U.S. has said Assad has no place in Syria's future.
