**联合国机构称伊朗核调查取得重大进展**

国际原子能机构总干事天野之弥星期一说，联合国对有关伊朗试图发展核武器的指责所进行的长期调查取得了“重大进展”。天野之弥说，他已经向国际原子能机构理事会报告了他的伊朗之行，包括访问调查重点之一的帕尔钦军事地点。

天野之弥说，伊朗方面在他访问帕尔钦之前就提交了帕尔钦的空气样本。他说，在某些情况下，国际原子能机构允许相关国家参加检查活动，前提是国际原子能机构的工作不会受到影响。

他告诉记者，这些样本通过了该组织一个核查程序的检验，被证明是有效的。

星期一早些时候，国营的伊朗共和国通讯社援引伊朗核机构发言人的话说，收集环境样品时，国际原子能机构检查人员不在场。

伊朗多年来一直不准国际原子能机构进入帕尔钦，坚持说帕尔钦是军事性设施，不对外开放。伊朗官员认为，帕尔钦成为关注焦点是因为美国和以色列提供了错误情报，说伊朗企图制造核武器。长期以来，伊朗一直声称其核项目是用于和平目的的。


UN Nuclear Watchdog Says 'Significant Progress' in Iran Probe, Parchin Samples Taken

The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency said Monday that "significant progress" has been made in the U.N.'s long-running probe into allegations Iran worked to develop nuclear weapons.

Yukiya Amano said he reported to the IAEA's board about his trip to Iran that included visiting the Parchin military site that has been a key focus of the investigation.

Amano said environmental samples were taken at Parchin before his visit in a process that included Iranian representatives "swiping samples." He specified that in some circumstances the IAEA permits countries to participate in verification activities in ways that do not compromise the agency's work.

"Authentication by the agency of the samples was achieved through use of an established verification process," Amano told reporters.

Earlier Monday, Iran's state-run IRNA news agency quoted a spokesman for the country's nuclear agency saying samples were taken without IAEA inspectors present.

For years, Iran denied access to IAEA personnel, insisting Parchin was strictly military in nature and would not be opened up to outsiders. Iranian officials have blamed the U.S. and Israel for the focus on Parchin, saying those countries provided faulty intelligence alleging research toward building nuclear weapons. Iran has long insisted its nuclear program is peaceful.


**德国大众伪造排放数据 股票周一大跌**

德国汽车制造商大众汽车公司的股票星期一在法兰克福股票交易所开盘几分钟后下跌13%，之前有新闻说，该厂在美国出售的柴油动力车上安装了故意伪造排放数据的软件。

大众汽车公司的股票到星期一中午下跌了20%多。 在此前一天，大众汽车公司首席执行官马丁·温特科恩为辜负客户的信任表示道歉，并表示公司已责令全力配合外部调查。

大众汽车某些柴油动力车已停止在美国出售。美国联邦政府环境保护署上星期五指责德国大众汽车公司故意违反清洁空气法，责令其召回将近50万辆汽车。

美国环保署说，大众汽车公司在其柴油动力车上安装"失效裝置"软件，汽车的污染排放控制装置只有在专门检测排放时才会启动。这意味着汽车日常行驶时污染排放控制装完全关闭。

Shares of VW Drop 20% After Intentional False Emission Data

Shares in German automaker Volkswagen plunged more than 13 percent Monday just minutes after the Frankfurt exchange opened following news that many of its diesel cars in the United States had software that intentionally falsified emissions data.

The trend continued into mid-morning trading, which showed VW down more then 20 percent.

The huge drop comes one day after Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn apologized for breaking the trust of VW's customers, saying the company will fully cooperate with an external investigation the automaker has ordered.

Sales of some Volkswagen diesel cars have been halted in the U.S.

On Friday, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ordered Volkswagen to recall nearly 500,000 vehicles for intentionally violating clean air laws.

The EPA said VW has installed so-called "defeat device" software in its diesel-powered cars that only turn on its pollution emissions controls when the car is undergoing mandatory testing, meaning the controls are completely off during everyday driving.
