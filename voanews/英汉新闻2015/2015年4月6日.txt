**印度将跟踪监督全国空气质量**

印度总理莫迪星期一宣布将采用国家空气质量指数，跟踪印度10个城市的污染程度。

莫迪在新德里召开的各省环境部长会议上公布了这项新措施。

莫迪说，印度有保护环境的优良传统，是世界上污染水平最低的国家之一。

世界卫生组织去年的一份报告与莫迪的说法相反。该报告说，新德里的空气质量为世界最差。

印度新的国家空气质量指数将告诉印度公民当天的空气质量，级别为好、差、和有损健康。

India Measures Air Quality

India unveiled a National Air Quality Index Monday to keep track of pollution levels in 10 of its cities.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the new measure at a conference of state environment ministers in New Delhi.

Mr. Modi said India, with its strong tradition of protecting the environment, has one of the world's lowest pollution levels.

That claim was disputed by a World Health Organization report last year that said New Delhi has the world's dirtiest air.

The new index will inform Indian citizens whether the air quality for the day is healthy, poor, harmful or hazardous.


**加州连年干旱开始限制用水**

美国加州州长布朗为他决定农民不受强制性限水措施进行辩解。加州历史性的干旱正在加剧。

布朗州长星期天告诉美国广播公司“本周”节目说，加州农民生产美国在向世界上很多地区提供的大部分水果和蔬菜。

但是他表示会重新审视一项已经有一个世纪之久的州法律。这项法律允许加州农民比其他人支付较低的水费。他称这个法律系统“过时”。

加州干旱已经进入第四年，绝大部分地区处于专家所称的罕见干旱之中。布朗上周下令对全州居民和企业实施强制限水措施。违反规定的人将面临高额罚款。

布朗签署行政令的后一天，有一项新的报告称，到2050年，气候变化，海平面上升，沿海房产消失，不断升高的气温和持续干旱导致农田变干，将给加州造成数十亿美元的损失。

Restricted Water Use with Drought in California

California Governor Jerry Brown is defending his decision to exempt farmers from most mandatory water restrictions, as a historic drought worsens in the far western U.S. state.

Brown told ABC television's "This Week" public affairs program Sunday that California farmers are "providing most of the fruits and vegetables of America to a significant part of the world."

But he said he may re-examine a century-old state law that allows California farmers to pay less for water than everyone else. He called that system "archaic."

The governor imposed mandatory water restrictions on homes and businesses across the entire state last week as the drought enters its fourth year. Most of the state is in what experts call an exceptional drought. Those who violate the rules could face large fines.

A new report issued the day after Mr. Brown signed his executive action warns that California is facing billions of dollars of losses due to climate change by 2050, as coastal property disappears under rising sea levels, while its agricultural lands grow dry from increasing temperatures and continued drought.
