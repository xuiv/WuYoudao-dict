Secret Service Finds 'Device' on White House Grounds

A spokesman for U.S. President Barack Obama says the Secret Service has recovered a "device" believed to be a small drone on the grounds of the White House.

Josh Earnest told reporters traveling with Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, in New Delhi Monday that the device did not appear to be an ongoing threat to anyone at the White House.

He did not say exactly where it was found, and said the Secret Service would provide more information when available.

It was not immediately clear if the Obamas' two daughters were home at the time.

The incident caused authorities to restrict access to the White House complex.


**希腊左翼联盟党赢得选举**

立场激进的希腊左翼联盟党及该党40岁的领袖齐普拉斯在星期日的选举中大胜，击败了现任总理萨马拉斯领导的保守派政党新民主党。

左翼联盟党领袖齐普拉斯将成为希腊150年来最年轻的总理。他誓言结束几年来的紧缩政策。但选举结果很可能导致希腊与欧盟及国际借贷者发生冲突。

希腊左翼联盟党只差两个议席未能获得自组政府所需的151席，这样就要组建联合政府。

几乎立即就能感觉到希腊左翼政党获胜的反响。亚洲股市周一走低，而欧元跌至11年来的最低点，这反映出人们担心欧元区可能解体。欧盟国家的财政部长们星期一将举行会议，讨论希腊选举将对欧元产生的影响。

Anti-Austerity Party Wins Greek Election

A radical leftist party and its 40-year-old leader swept to power Sunday in Greece, outdistancing the conservative New Democracy party led by incumbent Prime Minister Antonis Samaras.

Alexis Tsipras, the chief of the Syriza party who will be the country's youngest prime minister in 150 years, has pledged to end years of austerity polices. However, the outcome of the election likely places Greece in conflict with the European Union and international creditors.

Syriza fell just two seats in parliament short of the 151 needed to rule on its own without forming a coalition government.

Repercussions from the win by the leftist party where felt almost immediately. Asian stocks were weak Monday, and the euro fell to an 11-year low, renewing fears the European common currency bloc could unravel. EU finance ministers are meeting Monday to discuss how their shared currency will be affected by the Greek election.
