**联合国报告：阿富汗法律对妇女不公**

联合国一份最新报告说，尽管伊斯兰原教旨主义的塔利班不再执政，但阿富汗的司法体系仍对妇女不公。

这份星期天公布的报告说，在侵犯妇女的案件中，只有5%的罪犯得到惩罚。

报告还说，很多阿富汗妇女在经济上依赖侵犯他们的男子。

阿富汗宪法保证妇女享有同等权利，近几年来妇女在教育和就业机会等方面有所改善。

但是报告说，文化和家庭压力，以及司法官员被指腐败和滥用职权，使许多妇女感到申冤无门。

联合国官员敦促阿富汗政府通过机构和政策改革，切实执行保护妇女免遭暴力侵犯的法律，进而加强妇女获得司法保护的机会。

UN Report: Afghan Legal System Failing Women

A new United Nations report says Afghanistan's judicial system is still failing women, even with the Islamic fundamentalist Taliban out of power.

The report released Sunday says only 5 percent of cases of violence against women result in punishment for the criminals.

The reports also says many Afghan women are financially dependent on the men who attack them.

Afghanistan's constitution guarantees equal rights for women. Educational and job opportunities for women have improved in recent years.

But the report says cultural and family pressure, along with alleged corruption and abuse of power by judicial officials, leaves many women feeling as if there is nowhere they can find justice.

U.N. officials urge the Afghan government to strengthen access to justice for women by adopting institutional and policy reforms, and enforcing laws protecting them from violence.


**FBI承认20年间法医物证存在缺陷**

美国主要报纸《华盛顿邮报》报道，美国联邦调查局和司法部“正式承认”，在2000年之前的20多年里，联邦调查局精英法医团队中的几乎所有的检验者在针对刑事案件被告中给出了有缺陷的证词。

《华盛顿邮报》星期天报道，全国刑事辩护律师协会和法律援助组织“无辜项目”说，在对268个审判案件的复查中有95%以上的案件显示，在联邦调查局实验室显微镜毛发对比鉴定团队的28名检验人员当中，有26人为了有利于检方而“夸大了法医匹配”的结果。

这两个组织说，复查的案子包括已被判处死刑的32名被告，他们中的14人或已被执行死刑，或已死在狱中。

联邦调查局的错误并不意味着法庭缺乏其他证据判定被告有罪。

联邦调查局和司法部发布的声明说，他们保证确保将过去的疏漏告知受到影响的被告，并保证正义在每一起案子中得以伸张。

US Criminal Cases: FBI Examiners Gave 'Flawed Testimony' Over Two Decades

The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department have "formally acknowledged" that almost all of the examiners "in an elite FBI forensic unit gave flawed testimony" against criminal defendants for more than two-decades before 2000, a leading newspaper reports.

The Washington Post reported Sunday the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and the Innocence Project say 26 of the 28 examiners with the FBI Laboratory's microscopic hair comparison unit "overstated forensic matches" to favor prosecutors in more than 95 percent of the 268 trials reviewed.

The reviewed cases included 32 defendants who were sentenced to death. Fourteen of them have either been executed or died in prison, the two groups said.

The errors by the FBI do not mean there was not other evidence to convict the defendants.

An FBI and Justice Department statement said they "are committed to ensuring that affected defendants are notified of past errors and justice is done in every instance."
