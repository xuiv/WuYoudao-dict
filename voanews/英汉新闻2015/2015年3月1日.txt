**以总理开始阻止伊核协议“历史使命”**

以色列总理内塔尼亚胡前往华盛顿，准备在美国国会发表演讲。他的这次演讲计划引起争议。

内塔尼亚胡星期天在特拉维夫本古里安机场说，他这次赴美的历史使命是争取阻止伊核协议。

白宫对共和党籍的众议院议长贝纳邀请内塔尼亚胡在国会发表演讲前没有与白宫磋商表示极为不满。一些民主党议员准备以缺席抵制内塔尼亚胡星期二的演讲。

白宫国家安全顾问苏珊·赖斯表示，内塔尼亚胡的演讲计划破话美以关系的基础。她本星期说，美国和以色列的关系一贯得到两党支持，但是由于最近共和党的单方行动而受到损害。

内塔尼亚胡面临3月份的选举。他星期天说，他将竭尽全力确保以色列的安全。


Netanyahu: On 'Historic Mission' to Stop Iran Nuclear Deal

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is headed to Washington where he is set to give a controversial address to a joint meeting of the U.S. Congress.

The prime minister said Sunday at Israel's Ben Gurion Airport that he is on a "historic mission" to try and stop a nuclear deal with Iran.

The White House is angry that Republican House Speaker John Boehner did not consult with it before extending the invitation to Mr. Netanyahu to speak to the lawmakers. Some Democratic lawmakers plan to boycott the Netanyahu speech on Tuesday.

National Security Adviser Susan Rice has called Mr. Netanyahu's plans "destructive to the fabric of the relationship." She said this past week that the relationship between the U.S. and Israel “has always been bipartisan,” but that it has been hampered by recent partisan moves.

Mr. Netanyahu, who is facing re-election later this month, said Sunday he would do "everything in my power" to insure Israel's future.

**塔瓦雷·巴斯克斯成为乌拉圭新总统**

75岁的肿瘤医生塔瓦雷·巴斯克斯周日成为乌拉圭新总统，这是他第二次担任这一职务，上次是从2005年到2010年。这个南美国家总统任期为五年但禁止连任。

巴斯克斯的前任何塞·穆希卡非常受欢迎。他从前是游击队员，生活俭朴。这两位总统都来自“广泛阵线”。这个左翼政党执政已经连续10年。

在何塞·穆希卡任期内，乌拉圭实现了大麻和堕胎的合法化。他住在一个简陋的农场，开一辆老旧的大众甲壳虫汽车，他身边的伙伴是一只3条腿的狗。

美国副总统拜登周六与巴斯克斯通过电话，对他当选总统并即将上任表示祝贺。

他还对无法出席巴斯克斯的就职典礼表示遗憾，但表示奥巴马总统已派农业部副部长克里斯塔·哈登和美国驻联合国副代表米歇尔·西逊前往乌拉圭。

Tabare Vazquez to Become Uruguay's New President

Tabare Vazquez, a 75-year-old oncologist, becomes Uruguay's new president Sunday; his second time in that office. He was Uruguay's president from 2005 to 2010. The South American country bars presidents from serving consecutive terms, which last five years.

Mr. Vazquez takes the leadership role of Uruguay from the highly popular Jose Mujica, a former guerilla fighter known for his humble lifestyle. Both President Mujica and President-elect Vazquez belong to the Broad Front Coalition, which has been in power for a decade.

Under Mr. Mujica, Uruguay legalized marijuana and the right to an abortion. Mr. Mujica's lifestyle includes living on a modest farm and driving an aging, weathered Volkswagen Beetle. His three-legged dog is his almost-constant companion.

U.S. Vice President Joe Biden called Mr. Vazquez Saturday to offer the president-elect congratulations on his upcoming inauguration.

Biden also expressed his regrets at having to cancel his trip to the inauguration, but told Mr. Vazquez that President Barack Obama was sending Deputy Secretary of Agriculture Krysta Harden and U.S. Deputy Representative to the United Nations Ambassador Michele Sison to attend the ceremony.
