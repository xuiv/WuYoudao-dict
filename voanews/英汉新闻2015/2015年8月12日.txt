Greek Lawmakers Prepare Bailout Bill for Thursday Vote

Greek lawmakers are finishing a draft bill for the country's third government bailout package in five years, aiming for a vote before a meeting of eurozone ministers on Friday.

On Tuesday, Greece and its international creditors agreed “in principle” on broad terms of a new bailout.

European Commission spokeswoman Annika Breidthardt, a key mediator of the talks, confirmed progress on a $94 billion package.

Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has asked parliament to convene an emergency session to vote on the new bailout deal late Thursday.

Greece needs the money by August 20, when it must repay about $3.5 billion in debt to the European Central Bank.

**中国连续贬值人民币**

中国连续第二天使人民币贬值，这一出人意料的举措在世界各地市场引起反响，并可能使中国与其贸易竞争对手之间的关系变得紧张。

人民币汇率星期二下降将近2%。这是10年来人民币汇率的最大单日跌幅。星期三，人民币汇率再降1.6%。

中国中央银行说，这一举措是暂时的，是为了使人民币币值更符合市场状况。中国中央银行对人民币进行严格的控制。

中国央行星期三说，根据对国际国内经济形势的分析，目前不存在人民币持续贬值的基础。

人民币贬值能够刺激增长，推升中国的出口，使中国的出口商品价格更低，更具竞争力。

有人担心中国的决定会刺激其他国家也这样做。星期三，越南允许本国货币贬值，更凸显了这种担心。

China Further Devalues Yuan Currency

China has allowed the value of its currency to drop for a second consecutive day, repeating a surprise move Tuesday that rattled global markets and could raise tensions with its trade competitors.

The Chinese yuan's value fell 1.6 percent Wednesday after falling nearly 2 percent a day earlier, which was its biggest single-day drop in a decade.

China's central bank, which strictly controls the currency, described the move as temporary and meant to make the value of the yuan more market-oriented.

"Looking at the international and domestic economic situation, currently there is no basis for a sustained depreciation trend for the yuan," the bank said Wednesday.

The decision could spur growth and boost China's exporters. A cheaper yuan makes the nation’s exports less expensive and more competitive.

There are fears the decision could prompt other nations to devalue their currencies. Those concerns were heightened Wednesday when Vietnam allowed its currency, the dong, to weaken.
