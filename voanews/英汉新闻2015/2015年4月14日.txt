**人权观察: 关注平壤侵犯人权**

人权观察组织说，国际社会应当利用星期三朝鲜创建者金日成诞辰之机，要求平壤停止长期以来的侵犯人权行为。

人权观察强调指出，朝鲜现任领导人金正恩的祖父金日成有系统地利用劳教、再教育中心、言论遏止和个人崇拜来建立专制政府。

人权观察亚洲部副主任罗伯逊说：“金日成将他的统治建立在残酷的人权侵犯、对独立声音的压制以及对经济和社会的控制的基础之上，从而导致了剥夺和最终大面积的饥荒。”

罗伯逊说，金正恩继续实行其祖父的政策，应当将他送交国际刑事法庭。

Human Rights Watch: Focus on Rights Abuses in North Korea

Human Rights Watch says the world should use Wednesday's anniversary of North Korea's founding president, Kim Il Sung, to demand an end to enduring abuses in the country.

The group highlighted the systematic way in which the grandfather of current leader Kim Jong Un used labor camps, reeducation centers, prohibitions on expression and the development of a cult mentality to establish an authoritarian government.

"Kim Il Sung based his rule on ruthless rights abuses, repression of independent voices, and economic and social controls that led to deprivation and ultimately widespread starvation," said Human Rights Watch Deputy Asia Director Phil Robertson.

He said Mr. Kim has continued his grandfather's policies and should be referred to the International Criminal Court.


**日本法院禁止启动核反应堆**

日本一家法院星期二下达命令，不准一家电力公司重启两座核反应堆。

日本核管理机构本来已经批准关西电力公司按照2011年发生地震和海啸后制定的新标准，重新启动位于西部福井县的第三号和第四号核反应堆。

但当地居民对今年晚些时候重新启动核反应堆的计划提出挑战，认为新标准不足以保护核反应堆在强烈地震中免受损坏。

关西电力说，该公司将对这一裁决提出申诉。

Japanese Court Halts Plan to Restart 2 Nuclear Reactors

A court in Japan issued an injunction Tuesday blocking a power company from restarting two of its nuclear reactors.

Nuclear regulators had already cleared Kansai Electric Power to restart the No. 3 and No. 4 reactors at a plant in the western province of Fukui according to new standards put in place following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami at the Fukushima nuclear plant.

But residents challenged the plan to resume operations later this year, saying the new standards were not sufficient to protect against a powerful earthquake.

Kansai said it would appeal the ruling.
