Flooding Kills 27 in Myanmar

Flooding in Myanmar has now killed at least 27 people and affected more than 150,000, numbers that are both expected to rise, as the government, military and relief organizations work to carry out rescue operations and provide aid.

In Rakhine state, along Myanmar’s southwestern coast, the U.N.’s humanitarian agency said Saturday that there are reports of “extensive damage” to camps around Sittwe, where 100,000 people already displaced by conflict in Myanmar have been staying.
