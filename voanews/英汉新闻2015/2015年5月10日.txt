兰选民正在全国大选中投票选举总统，预计将现任总统科莫罗夫斯基将当选连任，但第一轮投票可能无法决定。

另有十名候选人周日参加大选，但没有一位候选人可能获得避免5月24日决选的超过半数选票。

波兰人有大约40％支持立场中间偏右的科莫罗夫斯基。据最近调查，他很有可能在第二轮投票中面对民族主义反对党-法律与公正党的安杰伊·杜达。

这次投票是对波兰两大政治力量在今秋议会投票前的一次考验。科莫罗夫斯基领导的执政党是公民纲领党。

大约3080万合格选民有权自由投票。

Poles Vote for President

The Poles are voting for president in nationwide balloting that is expected to see
incumbent, Bronislaw Komorowski, re-elected, but not in first round balloting.

Ten other candidates are running in Sunday's election, but none is likely to receive the more than 50 percent of the vote needed to avoid a May 24 runoff.

Some 40 percent of Poles support Mr. Komorowski, a center-right candidate, according to recent surveys that indicate he will most probably face Andrzej Duda, of the nationalist opposition Law and Justice party in a second round.

The vote is a test for Poland's two major political forces ahead of the parliamentary vote scheduled in the fall. Mr. Komorowski is aligned with the ruling Civic Platform party.

Some 30.8 million eligible voters are free to cast ballots.

**母亲节的来历**
这个星期天在美国和世界各地几十个国家是母亲节。母亲节是庆祝并感谢所有女性所做的工作的节日。

据历史频道陈述，母亲节于1914年成为美国的正式节日。这是由于安娜·贾维斯的努力，她把这个节日看作纪念母亲们为其子女所做出的牺牲的一种方式。

贾维斯原本设想的母亲节是母亲和家庭之间个人庆祝的日子。然而，当这一天成为法定假日时，没多久花店、贺卡公司和其他商家就蜂拥而上，趁着这个备受人们青睐的节日大发其财。

贾维斯反对此很反感，并在1948年她去世前否认自己是这个节日的发起人。她甚至游说政府从美国日历中撤销这个节日。但母亲节仍然存在。它是最流行的节日之一，也是最大的消费节日之一。

Sunday is Mother's Day

Sunday is Mother's Day in the U.S. and scores of countries around the world.

Mother's Day is a time to celebrate and appreciate all the work that women do.

According to the History Channel, Mother's Day became an official U.S. holiday in 1914, due to the efforts of Anna Jarvis, who saw the holiday as a way of honoring the sacrifices mothers make for their children.

Jarvis had originally envisioned Mother's Day as a day of personal celebration

between mothers and families. However, when the day became an official holiday, it was not long before florists, card companies and other merchants pounced to capitalize on the day's popularity.

Jarvis was disgusted and disowned the holiday before her death in 1948. She had even lobbied the government to remove the holiday from the American calendar.

But Mother's Day persists. It is one of the most popular holidays and is one of the biggest holidays for consumer spending.
