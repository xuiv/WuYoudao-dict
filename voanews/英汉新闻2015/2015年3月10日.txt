**缅甸中部学生与警察爆发冲突**

星期二，学生抗议者与警察在缅甸中部一个城镇发生冲突。一个多星期来，地方当局一直阻止活动人士游行前往仰光要求实行教育改革。

里伯坦的目击者说，防暴警察用警棍殴打试图冲破警戒线的学生。来自冲突现场的一段视频显示，身穿护具的警察打碎了学生们使用的一辆汽车的前窗玻璃。

在爆发冲突的几小时前，学生领导人对美国之音说，当地政府同意允许活动人士继续抗议游行，前往缅甸主要城市仰光。目前还不清楚协议破裂的具体情况，也不清楚是否有人受伤或被逮捕。

上个月，数百名学生从曼德勒开始游行，要求缅甸军人主导的政府取消一项新的教育改革法。

学生们说，这项法律将对缅甸大学进行集中控制。他们还要求政府增加教育开支，并要求给予教师和学生结社自由。

Students, Police Clash in Central Myanmar

Student protesters and police clashed Tuesday in a central Myanmar town where authorities have for more than a week prevented the activists from marching to Yangon to demand education reform.

Witnesses in Letpadan said riot police used batons to beat back students who tried to push through police lines. A video from the scene appeared to show armored police smashing the windshield of a vehicle used by the students.

The clashes came hours after student leaders told VOA the government agreed to let the activists continue their protest march to Yangon, Myanmar's main city. It is not clear what part of the reported deal broke down. It is also not clear if there were any injuries or arrests.

The group, made up of hundreds of students, set off from Mandalay last month to demand Myanmar's military-dominated government scrap a new education reform law.

The students say the law will centralize control of universities in Myanmar, also known as Burma. They also want more government spending on education as well as the freedom to organize teachers and students.
