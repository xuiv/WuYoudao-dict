China, Australia Sign Landmark Free Trade Agreement

China and Australia have signed a landmark free trade agreement that follows about a decade of negotiations.

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Chinese Trade Minister Gao Hucheng attended the signing ceremony Wednesday in Canberra.

"It will change our countries for the better , it will change our region for the better, it will change our world for the better," said Mr. Abbott.

Trade Minister Gao praised the free trade deal, which was struck late last year, as "comprehensive, high-quality and balanced."

"It has the highest degree of liberalization amongst all the FTA's China has so far signed with another economy," he said.

Under the pact, tariffs eventually will be lifted on 95 percent of Australian exports, according to the official Xinhua news agency.

The wide-ranging agreement will also lower restrictions on Chinese investment in Australia and make it easier for Australian banks, insurance companies and universities to do business in China.

China is Australia's biggest trading partner. Two-way trade between the two nations amounts to over $123 billion annually.


**朝鲜面临百年来最严重的旱灾**

据朝鲜国家媒体报道，朝鲜正在经历着一个世纪以来最严重的旱灾，进一步加重了这个贫穷国家的粮食短缺问题。

朝中社星期二说，这次百年来最严重的旱灾正在造成巨大损失。朝中社还说，由于几乎没有降雨，几个主要的产稻省份（包括黄海道和平安道）的稻田都已干裂。

朝鲜曾在上世纪90年代发生一次严重饥荒，导致数十万人死亡。此后，朝鲜经常处于粮食短缺状态，洪水、干旱和管理不当使问题变得更加严重。

联合国说，朝鲜人口的70%，也就是1800万人面临粮食短缺和缺少营养多样性问题。在五岁以下的朝鲜儿童中，27.9的人长期营养不良。

North Korea Drought 'Worst in a Century'

North Korea is suffering through its most severe drought in a century, according to a state media outlet, worsening an already serious food shortage in the impoverished country.

"The worst drought in 100 years continues in the DPRK, causing great damage," said the Korean Central News Agency on Tuesday.

KCNA said paddies have dried up in several key rice-growing provinces, including Hwanghae and Pyongan, because of almost a total lack of rainfall.

North Korea experienced a devastating famine in the early 1990s, leaving hundreds of thousands dead.

It has since has suffered regular chronic food shortages, with the situation exacerbated by floods, droughts and mismanagement.

The United Nations says 70 percent of the population, or 18 million North Koreans, are food insecure and lack nutritional diversity. Malnutrition rates are high, with 27.9 percent of children under five suffering from chronic malnutrition.
