Rebels Make Gains in Yemen

Houthi rebels in Yemen continue to gain ground in the southern city of Aden Sunday, despite a Saudi-led airstrike campaign.

The French News Agency reports the rebels have taken the provincial government headquarters, including the governor's office, in Aden's Mualla district.

Russia and the International Committee of the Red Cross want Saudi Arabia to pause its military campaign against the Houthi rebels to allow for safe deliveries of civilian aid and the evacuation of foreigners.

The Russian plea came Saturday during an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council called by Moscow. A Russian draft proposal demands "regular and obligatory" pauses in airstrikes by the Saudi-led Sunni coalition battling Shi'ite rebels in Yemen.

In Geneva, the Red Cross also called for an immediate break in hostilities, saying its aid shipments are being blocked.

Jordan's U.N. ambassador, Dina Kawar, said Council members hope to reach a decision on the Russian-backed resolution by Monday. She spoke in her role as this month's president of the Council.
