**奥巴马对埃塞俄比亚进行历史性访问**

美国总统奥巴马星期一在埃塞俄比亚首都与埃塞俄比领导人举行一天会晤。这是美国总统首次访问这个东非大国。恐怖主义、发展与人权必定是两位领导人讨论的内容。

奥巴马总统和德萨莱尼总理的会谈将涉及许多问题。埃塞邻国索马里首都最近遭到恐怖袭击，因此恐怖主义是两位领导人首先要讨论的问题。

发展是另一个主要问题。埃塞首都亚的斯亚贝巴正在迅速发展。埃塞经济近几年以两位数字的速度增长。

但是奥巴马也警告说，他会坦率地提及他认为重要的问题，例如人权问题。埃塞俄比亚政府近年来被指责有严重侵犯人权行为，其中包括压制媒体，骚扰异议人士。

这些都将成为奥巴马对埃塞俄比亚历史性国事访问中令人关注的话题。

Obama Meets with Ethiopian Leaders on Historic State Visit

President Barack Obama is spending all day meeting with his Ethiopian counterpart in that nation's capital on the first state visit by a US president to the East African powerhouse. Terrorism, development and human rights are sure to be raised in discussions between the two leaders.

President Barack Obama has a lot to talk about with his counterpart, Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn, as the two meet in Ethiopia's capital.

Terrorism tops the agenda, especially in light of a recent terror attack in the capital of neighboring Somalia.

Development is also high on the agenda. Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, has been rapidly expanding. And the economy of this country has been seeing double digit growth for the last few years.

But Mr. Obama has also warned that he will not mince words on things that are important to him, like human rights, a sore spot for Ethiopia as the regime has been accused of numerous abuses in recent years, including stifling of the press and harassment of dissidents.

These are all sure to make for interesting discussions on Mr. Obama's historic state visit to Ethiopia.

**也门实施人道停火 仍有战斗**

星期一，以沙特为首的阿拉伯盟国在五天人道停火开始之际暂停对也门的空袭，不过胡塞反政府武装拒绝接受停火，有些地区仍有激烈战斗。

星期一有报道说，反政府武装在南方一些地方发动袭击。

以沙特为首的盟国四个月来一直空袭与伊朗结盟的胡塞什叶派武装，但沙特等国最近宣布暂时停火，以便向也门运送急需的人道救援物资。

胡塞反政府武装领导人阿卜杜勒·马立克·胡塞星期天说，停火只会对伊斯兰国和基地组织激进分子有利。胡塞组织在推特网站上援引他的话说，“战斗仍在进行，战争还没有结束”。

Some Fighting Continues in Yemen Despite Truce

Saudi-led coalition airstrikes in Yemen are on hold Monday at the start of a five-day humanitarian truce, although intense ground fighting continues in some areas after Houthi rebels rejected the cease-fire.

Rebel attacks were reported Monday in parts of the south of the country.

The coalition that has been fighting the Iranian-allied Houthi Shi'ite rebels with air attacks for the past four months declared the temporary truce to allow badly needed emergency supplies into Yemen.

On Sunday, Houthi chief Abdel-Malek al-Houthi said a cease-fire would only benefit Islamic State and al-Qaida militants. "The battle goes on and the war is not over," al-Houthi was quoted as saying on his group's Twitter account.
