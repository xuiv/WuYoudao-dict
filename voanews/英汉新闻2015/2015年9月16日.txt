**奥委会宣布2024年奥运五大候选主办城市**

国际奥委会星期二午夜申请期截止之后宣布有五个城市入围2024年夏季奥运会主办城市候选名单。 这五个城市是布达佩斯、汉堡、巴黎、罗马四个欧洲城市和美国西海岸的洛杉矶。

奥委会主席巴赫说，这五个城市都是优秀的城市，竞争将是“强烈和很吸引人的”。奥委会将在2017年宣布最后决定。

2024年夏季奥运会将是奥委会改革后举办的首次奥运会。改革的目的是让奥运会对主办城市来说更具成本效益，更有利于该城市的长期发展。巴赫星期三表示,国际奥委会将为2024年夏季奥运会出资17亿美元。

巴黎主办过1924年奥运会，他们希望在2024年主办百年纪念版奥运。1932年和1984年两次主办奥运的洛杉矶也希望再有机会。

在波士顿和多伦多因担心费用过高而退出竞争之后，洛杉矶成为唯一进入候选名单的北美城市。

德国汉堡11月将举行全民公投，以确定当地居民是否希望在汉堡举办奥运会。

IOC Announces 2024 Olympic Contenders

The IOC made its announcement, soon after the midnight Tuesday deadline for contenders, of five finalists to host the 2024 Summer Olympic Games: the four European cities of Budapest, Hamburg, Paris, and Rome, and the U.S. west coast city of Los Angeles.

IOC President Thomas Bach called the finalists "outstanding cities" and predicted the race will be "strong and fascinating." The final decision is to be announced in 2017.

This is the first Olympics planned under IOC reforms that are geared toward making the event more cost-effective for host cities and more useful to their long-term development plans. Bach said Wednesday that the IOC will contribute $1.7 billion to the event.

Paris is bidding for a chance to host a centennial version of the 1924 Games held in that city, while Los Angeles wants a chance to host again after staging the Games in 1932 and 1984.

Los Angeles is the only North American city in the running after the withdrawals of Boston and Toronto, both of whom cited cost concerns.

Hamburg is to hold a referendum in November to determine whether city residents want to host the Games.

**联合国建议斯里兰卡成立战争罪特别法庭**

联合国星期三公布的一份报告指出，斯里兰卡本国的司法系统不可靠，应当利用一个特别法庭来负责任的审理26年内战期间的违法行为。

这个建议是在有关斯里兰卡内战的报告中提出的。 联合人权办公室认为，在政府军与寻求泰米尔独立的反政府武装冲突中，有人可能犯下了战争罪和反人类罪。据广泛接受的估计，战斗导致10万人死亡 。

联合国的报告说，斯里兰卡应当参考其他国家使用国际法官、检察官、律师和调查人员的方式。

联合国人权事务高级专员侯赛因说，“单靠斯里兰卡国内法院程序，无法克服几十年暴力、渎职和食言所引发的广泛和有理由的猜疑。”

报告赞扬斯里兰卡新政府表示致力于追究责任，但是报告详细列举了多个障碍，其中包括缺乏保护受害者和证人的有效系统。

UN Recommends Special Court for Sri Lanka War Probe

The United Nations released a report Wednesday saying Sri Lanka cannot rely on its own justice system and instead should use a special court to achieve accountability for violations that took place during the country's 26-year civil war.

The recommendation came as part of a report on what the U.N. Human Rights office said were possible war crimes and crimes against humanity during the conflict that pitted government forces against rebels seeking independence for the nation's Tamil minority. The fighting killed up to 100,000 people, according to widely accepted estimates.

Sri Lanka, the report said, should look to the way other countries have used international judges, prosecutors, lawyers and investigators.

"A purely domestic court procedure will have no chance of overcoming widespread and justifiable suspicions fueled by decades of violations, malpractice and broken promises," U.N. rights chief Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said.

The report praised Sri Lanka's new government for its stated commitment to seek accountability, but detailed multiple obstacles such as what it said is the lack of a reliable system to protect victims and witnesses.
