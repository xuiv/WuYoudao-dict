Fear, Frustration Among Refugees as Terror Tensions Rise

As fears intensify over terrorists threats in Europe, a cloud of worry hangs over the refugee camps on the continent.

In Germany, Syrians say they fear backlash if they are blamed for Islamic State militants’ increasingly horrifying campaign.

In the wake of the Paris attacks, he said, Syrian refugees in Europe are sometimes feared and politicians around the world are warning that terrorists may be hiding among the refugees.

By some estimates, 1.5 million from the Middle East, Africa and increasingly other places will have migrated to Europe by the beginning of 2016.

President Barack Obama said he will veto legislation that puts more restrictions on Syrian and Iraqi refugees.

**美国：无可靠信息确认IS将袭击美法等国**

美国国务院说，没有任何信息能确认有关伊斯兰国组织策划星期天在法国、美国和其他地方发动攻击的报道。

美国国务院的声明是对匿名者组织在网上发布的一条信息。该组织说，它发现了将发生恐怖袭击的信息，目标还包括意大利和黎巴嫩等一些地方。匿名者组织说，已经将有关信息提供给美国和英国的情报机构。

据说美国东南部城市亚特兰大星期天晚上的一场职业摔跤比赛可能是袭击目标之一。美国联调局星期六发布的一项声明说，对所有威胁都将认真对待，但是目前没有任何有关将发生袭击的具体或可靠情报。

美国国务院拒绝说明它是否已经在美国驻海外的设施增强戒备，但是说，最近发生一系列事件之后，国务院在所有工作中一直保持高度警惕。

No Credible Information on Reported Islamic State Threats


The U.S. State Department says it has "no information to confirm" reports Islamic State plans to launch more attacks in France, the United States and elsewhere on Sunday.

Their statement came in response to a question about online activist group Anonymous, which said it had uncovered information about imminent plots that also included sites in Italy and Lebanon. The group said it forwarded relevant information to U.S. and British intelligence agencies.

One of the supposed targets is a professional wrestling event Sunday in the U.S. city of Atlanta. An FBI statement Saturday said it takes all threats seriously, but it had no "specific or credible information of an attack at this time."

The State Department declined comment on whether it is taking extra security precautions at its facilities around the world, but said it is "already operating at a high level of security based on recent events."
