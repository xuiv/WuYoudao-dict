**大众汽车任命新董事长**

大众汽车集团推举其财务总监为新的董事长。这家德国汽车制造企业在美国正深陷尾气测试造假丑闻。

新任董事长汉斯·迪特尔·伯奇星期三说，需要一些时间才能解决尾气排放丑闻。伯奇承诺将尽一切可能弄清楚事件本身。他说上述这番话之前，出席了公司在德国沃尔夫斯堡总部召开的会议。

伯奇说：“公众，尤其是我们所有的客户，都有权全面获悉事件的情况。有关事件的推测或者不明确的初步结论，对每一个人都毫无帮助。因此，需要一些时间，我们才能告知确切可信的结果。”

在此之前，大众新CEO穆勒表示，他希望公司在1月可以开始召回受丑闻事件影响的车辆，或许能在明年年底前完成对这些车辆的维修。他是在接受德国《法兰克福汇报》的采访时说这番话的。

Volkswagen Elects New Chairman of its Board of Directors

Volkswagen elected its chief financial officer as chairman of its board of directors, as the German carmaker struggles with the scandal of emission test-rigging in the United States.

Hans Dieter Poetsch said Wednesday it will take some time to clear up the diesel emission scandal. Poetsch expressed his commitment to do everything possible to shed light on what happened. Poetsch spoke after the meeting at company headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany.

Poetsch said: "The public and above all our clients have a right to be informed comprehensively. Presumptions or vague preliminary facts of the matter help no one. That's why it will still take some time until there are confirmed and reliable results which we can then inform you about."

Ahead of the announcement, Volkswagen's new chief executive officer, Matthias Mueller, said he hopes the company can begin recalling vehicles in January and perhaps finish repairing all affected vehicles by the end of next year. He made his comments in an interview with German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.

Iran's Supreme Leader Bans Further Talks With US

Iran's top leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has banned direct talks with the United States because of what he described as "countless harm" to Iran's interests.

Addressing elite Revolutionary Guard commanders in Tehran Wednesday, Khamenei said direct negotiations with Washington open the way for U.S. "penetration" of the Islamic Republic.

Although he supported the last 18 months of negotiations, Khamenei has not publicly endorsed Tehran's historic nuclear agreement with the United States, Germany, France, Britain, China and Russia that settled a standoff of more than a decade.

Hardliners have accused the administration of President Hassan Rouhani of seeking a resumption of ties with Washington.

Hardline lawmakers also have threatened to impeach Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif for a historic handshake with President Barack Obama in New York last month.
