**韩活动人士用气球向朝鲜送《采访》光盘**

一名韩国活动人士说，他向朝鲜放飞了携带数千盘好莱坞影片《采访》光盘的气球。

这部影片虚构了美国中央情报局策划暗杀朝鲜领导人金正恩的故事。气球上还携带了反平壤的传单。

韩国“脱北者”活动人士李民福说，他四次放飞气球。最近一次是星期六。

平壤强烈反对这类气球放飞活动。去年10月，朝鲜向一些气球开枪，并引发了与韩国军队的短暂交火。

韩国政府敦促活动人士不要放飞气球，但同时表示放飞气球属于言论自由。

一些居住在边界附近的韩国人抱怨说，活动人士为了达到自己的目的而使当地居民面临生命危险。

Activists Send The Interview DVDs Into North Korea

A South Korean activist says he has launched balloons carrying thousands of copies of the Hollywood film The Interview into North Korea.

The film, which depicts a fictional CIA plot to kill North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, was included in the balloons along with anti-Pyongyang leaflets.

Lee Min-bok, a North Korean defector-turned activist, says he sent the balloons in four separate launches. The most recent occurred Saturday.

The North strongly opposes such launches. Last October it shot at some of the balloons, triggering a brief exchange of fire with Seoul forces.

The South Korean government has urged activists to refrain from sending the balloons, but says the launches are an act of free speech.

Some South Koreans living near the border have complained the activists are putting local residents lives at risk by making them potential targets.


**美国防部长:美日将扩大防务合作**

美国国防部长卡特星期三在东京与日本防务官员会谈时保证，美国将扩大与日本在防务领域的合作。

星期三是卡特三天访日行程的第一天。访问期间，双方将重新商讨华盛顿和东京之间的防务合作指针。

卡特此次访日还突显了美日两国之间的长期军事同盟关系。这是白宫重返亚洲战略的重要组成部分。

卡特说，他将致力于实施这一再平衡战略的下阶段使命。卡特说这番话时，日本防卫大臣中谷元站在他的身旁。

卡特与中谷元会谈时还表示，他证实美国在东中国海问题上的立场。东中国海岛屿之争是日中关系的焦点。

卡特说：“我还要重申总统奥巴马2014年7月的承诺。我们的安保条约适用于所有日本政府管辖下的领域。我们继续强烈反对任何单方面强制性破坏日本对尖阁列岛行政控制的行动”。

Carter Hails US-Japan Defense Alliance

U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter vowed to expand defense collaboration with Japan, as he held talks with his Japanese counterparts Wednesday in Tokyo.

Carter is on the first day of a three-day visit during which the two sides will renegotiate the defense coop-eration guidelines between Washington and Tokyo.

The trip is also meant to highlight the two countries' long-standing military alliance, a key part of the White House's attempts to refocus its priorities on Asia.

Speaking alongside Japanese Defense Minister General Nakatani, Carter said he was "committed to overseeing the next phase" of the so-called rebalance.

During his talks with Nakatani, Carter also said he "confirmed" the U.S. stance on the East China Sea islands that are at the center of a dispute with China.

"I also reaffirmed President Obama's July 2014 commitment to apply our security treaty to all areas under Japanese administration and our continued strong opposition to any unilateral coercive action that seeks to undermine Japan's administrative control of the Senkaku Islands," he said.
