**数十万巴西民众反腐示威**

数十万巴西民众星期日走上各地城市街头，要求迪尔玛•罗塞夫总统因政府腐败下台。

民众对罗塞夫总统的不满主要是因为巴西国家石油公司回扣计划的曝光，检察官称这是巴西被揭露出来的最大的腐败案。巴西最大的建筑和工程公司至少耗资8亿美元用于贿赂和其他基金，以换取巴西国家石油公司的合同。

几十名政界人士，其中包括总统的一些亲密盟友和巴西国家石油公司的前任高管，都受到调查。目前还没有人被定罪，但是22名议员、13名参议员以及两名州长受到涉嫌收受贿赂的指控。

一些贿赂行为是在罗塞夫总统担任巴西国家石油公司董事会主席时发生的，但罗塞夫本人并未受到调查。

除此之外，罗塞夫总统还面临通胀攀升，以及巴西经济濒于崩溃的危险。

星期日的集会基本是平静的，几乎没有发生2013年大规模示威中出现的那种暴力，当时巴西人抗议政府拨款主办1014年世界杯赛事。

Hundreds of Thousands Protest Corruption in Brazil

Hundreds of thousands of Brazilians took to the streets of cities across the country Sunday, demanding the ouster of President Dilma Rousseff over government corruption.

Much of the public anger toward Ms. Rousseff stems from revelations of a kickback scheme at state-run oil company Petrobras, which prosecutors call the biggest corruption scheme ever uncovered in Brazil. At least $800 million was paid in bribes and other funds by the nation's biggest construction and engineering firms in exchange for Petrobras contracts.

Dozens of political figures, including close allies of the president, and former Petrobras executives, are under investigation. No one has been convicted yet, but 22 deputies, 13 senators and two governors have been implicated in the bribe-taking allegations.

Some of the alleged wrongdoing took place while Ms. Rousseff was chairman of the Petrobras board. She is not being investigated.

In addition to the corruption scandal at Petrobras, Ms. Rousseff also is facing rising inflation and a Brazilian economy that is on the brink of recession.

Sunday's gatherings were mostly calm and festive, with little of the violence that tarnished a wave of massive demonstrations in 2013, when Brazilians protested spending to host the 2014 World Cup of soccer.


**波士顿今冬降雪量创纪录**

美国东北部城市波士顿今冬经历创纪录的大雪后，期待春天在星期五到来。

波士顿星期日又降雪7.4厘米，自去年11月以来，降雪总量达到275.8厘米。波士顿冬季降雪量平均为110厘米，今冬的降雪量为平均值的两倍以上。

今冬波士顿降雪较晚，波士顿国际机场去年12月的降雪量不到一厘米。波士顿的降雪量记录是以国际机场的降雪为准。但从1月25日开始的三周内，波士顿经受了多次恶劣的暴风雪，使得总降雪量达到217厘米。

波士顿今年2月的降雪量打破了1995年和1996年的记录。

Boston Sets Snowfall Record

People in the northeastern U.S. city of Boston will look forward to the arrival of spring Friday after enduring the city's highest winter season snowfall on record.

A storm on Sunday dropped another 7.4 centimeters of snow, pushing the total since November to 275.8 centimeters. That is more than double Boston's average of 110 centimeters of snow in a season.

The season actually started slow with Boston getting less than a centimeter of snow in December at its international airport where the official data is recorded. But in a three-week stretch starting January 25, the city endured a punishing stretch of multiple storms that dropped a combined 217 centimeters of snow.

That helped the month of February become Boston's snowiest since the previous record in 1995-'96.
