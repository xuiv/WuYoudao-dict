**朝鲜威胁将击落来自韩国的宣传气球**

朝鲜军方威胁要击落韩国活动人士计划放飞穿越戒备森严的南北交界处的气球。气球将运送1万张好莱坞电影《采访》的DVD盘。

《采访》是一部虚构美国中情局策划刺杀朝鲜领导人金正恩的好莱坞喜剧片。韩国活动人士说，他们计划3月26号放气球，把这部电影的DVD和50万张传单经过非军事区上空送到朝鲜。

朝鲜官方的朝鲜中央通讯社称这个放飞气球计划等同于“事实上的宣战”。

韩国军方说，如果朝鲜超韩国境内开火，就将予以回击。

非军事区韩国一侧的居民抱怨说，这些活动人士的作为给当地居民的生命带来危险，可能使他们成为朝鲜攻击的目标。

North Korea Threatens Retaliation for Propaganda Balloon Launch

North Korea's military is threatening to shoot down balloons that South Korean activists plan to send over the heavily militarized border carrying 10,000 DVDs of the Hollywood film The Interview.

Activists say they plan to launch copies of the film - a comedy about a fictional CIA plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jon Un, along with 500,000 propaganda leaflets across the de-militarized zone on or around March 26.

Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency called the planned launch a "de facto declaration of war."

The South's military said it would retaliate if North Korea opens fire on the South's territory.

South Korean residents living near the border have complained the activists are putting local residents lives at risk by making them potential targets.

Clashes Kill Seven Pakistani Soldiers, Dozens of Militants Near Afghan Border

Pakistan’s military says it has killed at least 80 Islamist militants and lost seven soldiers in fierce fighting near the mountainous Afghan border.

The clashes have been taking place in the remote Tirah Valley in the insurgency-plagued northwestern Khyber tribal district.

Army spokesman Major General Asim Bajwa reported “steady progress” in the counter-terrorism operation with code name Khyber-II, saying it is aimed at clearing areas close to Pakistan’s border with Afghanistan.

The militants, officials say, belonged to the outlawed Pakistani Taliban, an alliance of extremist outfits waging an insurgency against the state. Army jets have also pounded suspected militant positions in the areas over the past two days.

A spokesman for the group claimed the army death toll is much higher. Independent confirmation of the fighting details is not possible because journalists and aid groups have no access to the conflict zone.
