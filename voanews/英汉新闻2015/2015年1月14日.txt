**伊朗外长称双方有意加快伊核会谈**

伊朗外长扎里夫说，他星期三与美国国务卿克里的会晤表明，伊朗和伊核问题六大国已经准备好“加快”伊核谈判。

在日内瓦会晤开始前，扎里夫称与克里的会谈很“重要”. 他说，“只要我们对问题加以解决，一切都很容易。”

克里在会晤前没有发表讲话。克里本周早些时候说，他与扎里夫的讨论使得外交人员有评估双方立场的机会。

低级别谈判定于星期四恢复。

双方由于没能在去年11月最后期限前达成协议而决定延长谈判至今，已经两个月了。

现在距达成一个框架协议的目标还有大约6个星期的时间。最后协议的目的是缓解对伊朗核项目可能用于军事目的的担心，以换取解除伤及伊朗经济的制裁措施。

达成最后协议的最后期限是7月1日。

Zarif: Kerry Meeting Shows Willingness to 'Speed Up' Nuclear Talks

Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif says his meeting Wednesday with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry shows that Iran and a group of world powers are ready to "speed up" their negotiations on Iran's nuclear program.

Just before the meeting in Geneva began, Zarif called the talks with Kerry "important," and that "all issues are easy if we resolve them."

Kerry did not comment before the meeting. He said earlier this week his discussions with Zarif would be a chance for the diplomats to assess where the two sides stand.

Lower-level negotiations are due to resume on Thursday.

It has been two months since the two sides decided to extend the negotiations after failing to agree by their self-imposed November deadline.

Now, about six weeks remain before their goal of having a framework in place for a deal that would address concerns about possible military applications of the Iranian nuclear program in exchange for easing sanctions that have hurt the country's economy.

The deadline for a final agreement is July 1.


**克里支持联合国、俄罗斯推动叙利亚和平**

美国国务卿克里支持联合国在叙利亚城市阿勒颇终止战斗的努力，同时支持俄罗斯推动这个战乱国家重启和谈。

克里星期三会晤联合国叙利亚问题特使德米斯图拉后作出上述表达。

克里说，德米斯图拉计划通过一系列由各地谈判实现的停火使人道主义救援物资能够进入叙利亚。这是为在叙利亚取得进展而作出的“非常复杂但非常重要的努力”。

德米斯图拉下周将返回大马士革。他去年11月曾会晤叙利亚总统阿萨德，阿萨德称联合国的建议“值得研究”。

德米斯图拉星期三说，阿勒颇是一个“具有代表性的例子”。它可以显示如何结束暴力并给经历了近4年冲突的叙利亚人带来希望。

Kerry Expresses Support for UN, Russian Syria Peace Efforts

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has expressed support for U.N. efforts to halt the fighting in the Syrian city of Aleppo, as well as for Russia's bid to restart peace talks for the war-torn nation.

Kerry spoke Wednesday alongside the U.N. envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura after the two met in Geneva.

The secretary said de Mistura's plan to freeze fighting in Aleppo through a series of locally negotiated truces to allow in humanitarian aid is part of a "very complicated but very important effort" to make progress in Syria.

De Mistura is due to return to Damascus next week. He met in November with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who called the proposal something "worth studying."

The U.N. envoy said Wednesday that Aleppo is an "iconic example" of how the violence could end and bring hope to Syrians who are tired of nearly four years of conflict.
