**前泰国总理英拉被控渎职罪**

泰国总检察长对前总理英拉提出刑事诉讼，指控她参与一个失败的大米补贴项目，使泰国蒙受数十亿美元的损失。

星期四，泰国检察官指控英拉对该项目疏于监管。在实施该项目的过程中，政府以高于市场水平的价格向农民收购大米。英拉的反对者说，实施该项目是为了赢得农民的政治支持。

泰国最高法院必须在3月19日之前决定是否受理此案。如果罪名成立，英拉的最高刑期将是10年监禁。

泰国法院2014年5月下达命令，罢免了英拉的总理职务。几天后，泰国军人掌控了政权。上月，军方任命的泰国议会对英拉进行追溯弹劾，禁止她在五年内从事政治活动。

泰国军政府还考虑对英拉提出民事诉讼。星期三，泰国全国反贪委员会为大米补贴项目寻求180亿美元赔偿。

英拉说，对她的指控是出于政治动机，并表示大米补贴项目使泰国农民获益。

英拉是泰国前领导人他信的妹妹。在2006年的军事政变中，他信被罢黜，并被指控犯有贪腐罪。2008年，面临两年监禁判决的他信逃离泰国。但他信和他的为泰党仍受到民众支持，尤其是在农村地区。

Thai Ex-PM Yingluck Indicted Over Failed Rice Subsidy Program

Thailand's attorney general has filed criminal charges against former Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra over her involvement in a bungled rice subsidy program that cost the country billions of dollars.

Prosecutors on Thursday charged Ms. Yingluck with dereliction of duty for overseeing the program, which paid farmers above market prices for their rice. Her opponents say the program was an attempt to win the farmers' political support.

The Supreme Court must decide by March 19 whether to accept the case. If found guilty, Ms. Yingluck could be jailed for up to a decade.

Ms. Yingluck was ousted by a court order in May 2014, just days before the military seized power. Last month, Thailand's military-appointed legislature retroactively impeached her and banned her from politics for five years.

The Thai junta is also considering a civil suit against Ms. Yingluck. The National Anti-Corruption Commission on Wednesday recommended the government seek $18 billion in damages for the rice scheme.

The ex-prime minister claims the case against her is politically motivated and insists the rice subsidy program benefited Thai farmers.


**奥巴马星期四结束反极端主义峰会**

美国总统奥巴马星期四在国务院向60多个国家的代表发表讲话，以此结束为期三天的打击暴力极端主义峰会。

奥巴马星期三对一些社区和宗教领袖发表讲话，要求他们协助揭露“极端主义的虚假承诺”，驳斥所谓“恐怖主义”组织代表伊斯兰的说法。

奥巴马政府一直非常注意不把本周峰会的焦点仅仅集中在伊斯兰极端主义，而是针对所有形式的极端主义。

奥巴马总统星期三在白宫说：“他们试图把自己塑造成宗教领袖、圣战斗士。但他们不是宗教领袖，他们是恐怖分子。我们不是在跟伊斯兰作战，而是在跟歪曲伊斯兰的人作战。”

奥巴马还直接呼吁知名穆斯林人士更加努力地与残暴的意识形态拉开距离。

Obama to Conclude Anti-Extremist Conference Thursday

U.S. President Barack Obama will conclude a three-day conference on countering violent radicalism Thursday with a speech before representatives of more than 60 nations at the U.S. State Department.

During an address Wednesday before a group of community and religious leaders, Mr. Obama called on them to help fight "false promises of extremism" and reject the notion that "terrorist" groups represent Islam.

The Obama administration has been careful not to put the focus of this week's summit solely on Islamic extremism, but on all forms of extremism.

"They try to portray themselves as religious leaders, holy warriors," Mr. Obama said Wednesday at the White House. "They are not religious leaders, they are terrorists. We are not at war with Islam. We are at war with people who have perverted Islam.”

He also appealed directly to prominent Muslims to do more to distance themselves from brutal ideologies.
