**美国国会议员对总统国情咨文褒贬不一**

美国国会议员们对奥巴马总统的国情咨文演讲反应不一，而奥巴马的经济政策以及围绕伊朗核项目的国际谈判是议员们的关注焦点。

奥巴马星期二晚间结束在华盛顿国会山的演讲后，国会众议院少数党领袖佩洛西说，奥巴马在演讲中极其关注为美国家庭提供机会和繁荣，并强调他计划帮助中产阶级。

但今年赢得多数席位的共和党参议员们对奥巴马如何为实施有关计划提供资金提出质疑。

参议员加德纳表示，反对通过增税筹集资金。

奥巴马在谈到伊朗问题时说，对伊朗实施新制裁几乎等于宣告谈判失败，但一些议员主张对伊朗施加更大经济压力。

加德纳说，目前的做法对伊朗做出太多让步，同时却没有从伊朗得到足够的回报。

民主党参议员恩格尔也主张对伊朗实施更多制裁。几年来，制裁使伊朗经济受到损害。

民主党众议员斯科特也表示，对奥巴马的反恐政策感到不满。

一些议员支持奥巴马，包括民主党参议员博克瑟。她说，奥巴马在谈到美国领导团结一致的国际社会对抗恐怖主义威胁时，展示了领袖风范。

Congress Gives Mixed Reaction to Obama's State of the Union Speech

U.S. lawmakers have expressed a mix of reactions to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address, with a particular focus on his economic policies and the ongoing international negotiations on Iran's nuclear program.

After the speech Tuesday night at the Capitol in Washington, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Mr. Obama's speech a "powerful vision of opportunity and prosperity" for American families, and highlighted his plans to help those in the middle class.

But Republicans in the Senate, who reclaimed a majority this year, questioned how the president would fund those initiatives.

Senator Cory Gardner expressed opposition to raising money through new taxes.

On Iran, Mr. Obama said enacting new sanctions would "all but guarantee" the negotiations would fail, but some members of Congress are pushing for more economic pressure.

Senator Gardner said the current effort has given too many concessions to Iran, while not getting enough in return.

Democratic Representative Eliot Engel also wants more sanctions, which have hurt Iran's economy during the past few years.

Representative David Scott, a Democrat, expressed similar dissatisfaction with the president's counterterror policies.

Others backed Mr. Obama, including Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer, who said he "showed his leadership when he talked about America leading a united world in confronting the threat of terrorism."


**上海踩踏事件导致四名官员遭罢免**

中国惩处与上海新年前夕踩踏事件有关的11名政府官员。发生在黄浦江畔的这一事件造成36人死亡。

中国国家媒体星期三说，黄埔区党委书记和副书记、黄浦区公安局长和副局长星期三被免职。

旅游、公安和城市管理机关的七名官员也受到惩处。

星期三发表的调查报告指责官员们疏忽大意，对发生踩踏事件的黄浦江畔地区（或称“外滩”）管理不善。历年来，外滩在新年前夕总是很拥挤。

遇难者家属批评当地政府和紧急事务机构官员对危机的反应过于迟缓。这一事件发生在午夜前不久，人们聚集在上海市中心的黄浦江畔地区迎接新年。

中国以往也曾发生过踩踏事件。2004年，在一座桥上发生的踩踏事件造成37人死亡。

Four Officials Fired for Shanghai Stampede

China has punished 11 public officials over the New Year's Eve stampede in Shanghai that killed 36 people at an outdoor waterfront area.

State media announced Wednesday that four officials - the Huangpu District party chief, his deputy, the district security chief, and the deputy police chief - were fired Wednesday.

Seven other officials in tourism, public security, and urban management were disciplined.

Investigation results released Wednesday blame the officials for insufficient precautions and for poor site management at the waterfront area, known as "the Bund," which is traditionally crowded on New Year's Eve.

Families of the victims have criticized the local government and emergency officials for being too slow to respond to the crisis. It took place shortly before midnight, as people gathered at the riverfront site in central Shanghai to usher in the new year.

Witnesses say the stampede broke out when people rushed to pick up fake money that had been thrown from a third-story window.

China has seen deadly stampedes before. Thirty-seven people died in 2004 when they were trampled on a bridge during the Lunar New Year holiday.
