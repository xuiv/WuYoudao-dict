**南苏丹总统在埃塞俄比亚准备与叛军和谈**

南苏丹总统基尔星期天抵达埃塞俄比亚，准备参加旨在促成结束该国历时20个月内战的和谈。

基尔总统在抵达亚的斯亚贝巴的不到两天之前，出于担心计划参加星期一和谈的反叛派别出现分裂，无法组成一个团结阵线，他曾经取消了计划中的行程。后来

基尔总统改变了自己的想法，表示害怕他缺席和谈将被视为反对和平进程。

反叛派别代表团的组成情况直到星期天晚间仍然不明。此前不到一周，两名叛军将军表示，他们不再与基尔总统的主要对手、叛军领导人里克·马查尔为伍。

但是已经在亚的斯亚贝巴数天的里克·马查尔告诉美国之音，他将和来自肯尼亚、乌干达、埃塞俄比亚以及苏丹的领导人一道参加此次和谈。里克·马查尔还表示，双方都受到巨大的，要求签署和平协定的国际压力。


S. Sudan President in Ethiopia Ahead of Peace Talks with Rebels

South Sudan's President Salva Kiir arrived in Ethiopia Sunday for peace talks aimed at brokering an end to his country's 20-month civil war.

Mr. Kiir's presence in Addis Ababa comes less than two days after he cancelled the planned trip over concerns that rebel factions slated to participate in Monday's talks had split apart and would not present a united front. He later reversed himself, voicing fear that his absence from the talks would be seen as opposition to the peace process.

The makeup of the rebel delegation was not clear late Sunday, less than a week after two rebel generals said they were no longer allied with Mr. Kiir's chief rival, rebel leader Riek Machar.

But Machar, who has been in the city for several days, told VOA he will participate in negotiations with the leaders of Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia and Sudan at the regional summit. Machar also said both sides are under intense international pressure to sign an accord.
