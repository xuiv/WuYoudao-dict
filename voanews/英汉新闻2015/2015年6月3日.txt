**奥巴马签署法案 联邦机构不再搜集电话记录**

美国总统奥巴马签署了一项法案，就此结束了联邦政府机构为预防恐怖袭击而大规模搜集电话数据的做法。

奥巴马说，新规定既保护公民自由，也保障国家安全。

星期二早些时候，美国国会参议院以67票对32票的表决结果批准了这项法案。此前众议院已经批准了该法案。

依照新法案的规定，搜集和保存美国公民的电话通话记录由美国的电信公司负责，而高度机密的国家安全局不再担任这项任务。联邦调查人员如怀疑某人与已知或疑似恐怖分子进行接触，必须得到法院命令，才能审查电话记录。

纽约和华盛顿2011年9月11日遭受恐怖袭击后，美国政府开始搜集电话号码、拨打日期和通话时长，但不包括通话内容。

批评人士说，大量搜集与恐怖主义没有关系的美国人的电话信息是侵犯隐私权。
美国政府监听电话的授权于本周期满失效。这项新法案是妥协的结果。一些民主党和共和党议员认为，新规定的安全性较差，联邦有关当局将失去一个应对恐怖主义的主要手段。

Obama Signs Law Ending NSA Collection of Phone Calls

U.S. President Barack Obama has signed into law a bill ending the government's massive collection of telephone call data intended to prevent terrorist attacks.

Mr. Obama said the new rules protect both civil liberties and national security.

Earlier Tuesday, the Senate passed the bill 67-32. The House of Representatives had previously approved it.

Under the new rules, U.S. telephone companies and not the super-secret National Security Agency will collect and hold on to the phone call records of American citizens. Federal investigators would then need a court order to examine those records if they suspect anyone of contacting known or suspected terrorists.

The government began keeping records of telephone numbers, but not the content of those calls, just after the September 11th 2001 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington.

Critics said the program was a government invasion of privacy because of the millions of Americans whose calls were scrutinized, but who had no connection to terrorism.

The government's authority to spy on phone calls expired this week. The new rules are a compromise even though lawmakers from both parties say the new system will be less secure and takes a major tool in fighting terrorism away from federal authorities.


**韩国成功试射导弹 射程涵盖整个朝鲜**

韩国说，已经试制了一种能够打击朝鲜境内任何目标的弹道导弹。这被看作是对平壤最近军事挑衅做出的回应。

韩国国防部官员说，朴槿惠总统星期三在韩国南部现场观看了这次成功试射。

有关官员表示，这种导弹的射程为500公里，可以打到朝鲜任何地方，这种导弹将在今年年底进行部署。

首尔2012年同美国达成协议，把韩国弹道导弹的最高射程提高近三倍之后开发了这类武器。

韩国扩大弹道导弹装备，以回应朝鲜不断增长的核武器和导弹项目造成的威胁。

朝鲜最近表示，它成功进行了一次潜艇发射的弹道导弹试射，大大延伸了朝鲜弹道导弹的射程。

平壤上个月还表示，它改进了用于远程弹道导弹发射的核弹头小型化的技术。

许多外国和军方分析人士都表示，这些说法有可能夸大其辞，但是他们警告说，平壤正在这两个领域取得进展。

South Korea Tests Missiles That Can Hit 'Any Target' In North Korea

South Korea says it has tested a ballistic missile capable of hitting any target in North Korea, in what is seen as a response to recent military provocations by Pyongyang.

Seoul defense officials say President Park Geun-hye personally watched over the successful launch Wednesday at a firing range in the southern part of South Korea.

The missile has a range of 500 kilometers and can hit anywhere in North Korea, according to the officials, who add the technology will be deployed by the end of the year.

The weapon was developed by Seoul following a 2012 agreement with the U.S. that nearly tripled the allowable maximum range of the South's ballistic missiles.

South Korea has expanded its ballistic missile arsenal in response to the growing threat posed by North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.

North Korea recently said it conducted a successful submarine-launched ballistic missile test, which would greatly extend the range of the North's ballistic missiles.

Pyongyang also said last month that it has perfected the technology needed to mount a miniaturized nuclear warhead on a long-range ballistic missile.

A significant number of foreign and military analysts have said those claims are likely exaggerated, but warn that Pyongyang is making progress on both fronts.
