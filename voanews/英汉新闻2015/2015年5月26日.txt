**中国展示更咄咄逼人的军事政策**

中国星期二说，将继续把军事力量扩展到疆域之外，包括有争议海域，但同时坚持说，中国不希望与任何邻国发生对抗。

中国政府在一份政策性文件中说，中国军队将把重点从保卫领空转为攻防两个方面。此外，中国军队将更加强调在公海上的防御。

在这份文件发表之际，中国和美国围绕北京在南中国海填海造岛行动发生争执。这一举动使其他对该地区有主权要求的国家感到不安。

北京宣称对几乎整个南中国海拥有主权。在一家美国侦察机飞越斯普拉特利群岛附近的中国人造岛礁后，北京本星期就此提出正式抗议。

China Outlines More Assertive Military Policy

China said Tuesday it will continue expanding its military strength further from its borders, including in disputed areas at sea, but insisted it does not want a confrontation with any of its neighbors.

In a policy paper, China's cabinet said the People's Liberation Army will shift its focus "from territorial air defense to both defense and offense." It also will put a greater emphasis on "open seas protection."

The paper was released as China and the United States quarrel over Beijing's island-building in the South China Sea, which has unnerved several other nations with territorial claims there.

Beijing, which claims almost the entire sea, this week filed a formal complaint after a U.S. military spy plane flew a mission close to the Chinese man-made islands near the Spratly archipelago.

**马来西亚不准香港学运领袖黄之锋入境**

马来西亚当局拒绝向香港学生运动领袖黄之锋发放签证。 黄之锋是去年激怒北京的香港民主抗议活动的主要组织者之一。

黄之锋星期二在他的脸谱网上表示，马来西亚移民官员因为“政府命令”而对他拒签。 黄之锋没有透露更多情况。

马来西亚官员尚未发表评论。据说此事发生在马来西亚北部的槟城岛。

黄之锋原定在一系列研讨会上发言。研讨会的主题是中国基层民主运动和北京1989年镇压天安门民主运动。

黄之锋是香港学民思潮的创办人。学民思潮去年参与组织香港抗议示威，发挥了重要作用。抗议者要求北京准许香港在2017年举行真正普选。

当时数万名抗议者占领了一些街道，北京对香港的统治遭遇几十年来的最大挑战。

北京和香港当局不仅拒不让步，而且宣布占中运动是非法的，并强行驱散抗议者。

Hong Kong Democracy Activist Denied Entry to Malaysia

Malaysian authorities have denied entry to Hong Kong student activist Joshua Wong, one of the main organizers of last year's pro-democracy protests that riled Beijing.

Wong posted on his Facebook page Tuesday that a Malaysian immigration official denied him entry because of a "government order." The 18-year-old activist did not elaborate.

Malaysian customs officials have not commented on the incident, which is reported to have happened on the northern Malaysian island of Penang.

Wong was scheduled to speak at a series of seminars on the grassroots democracy movement in China and Beijing's 1989 crackdown on protesters at Tiananmen Square.

He is the founder of Scholarism, a group that played a major role in organizing last year's protests that demanded Beijing allow fully democratic elections in 2017.

At one point, tens of thousands of protesters blocked several key roads, providing the biggest challenge in decades to Chinese rule of the territory.

Beijing and Hong Kong officials refused to give in to the protesters' demands, instead declaring the gatherings illegal and forcibly breaking them up.
