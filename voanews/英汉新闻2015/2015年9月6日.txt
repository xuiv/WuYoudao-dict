Fatalities in Sinking of South Korean Charter Boat

At least eight people are dead after a fishing charter boat capsized off the southeastern South Korean coast late Saturday night.

The South Korean coast guard says the nine-ton boat named Dolphin was found Sunday morning near the resort island of Jeju, hours after it lost contact with maritime officials. The coast guard says three people have been rescued and flown to a nearby hospital.

One survivor told Yonhap news agency that the boat capsized "in an instant" due to strong waves. He said he and other survivors climbed on top of the capsized boat and held on for more than 10 hours before being rescued.

A manifest showed 22 passengers traveling on the Dolphin, but at least four of those listed were not onboard at the time of the accident.

Dozens of military and civilian ships are searching the surrounding area for more survivors.

Yonhap says South Korean President Park Geun-hye has ordered officials to "do everything possible for the search and rescue of the missing."
