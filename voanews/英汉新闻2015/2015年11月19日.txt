Protesters Clash With Police as APEC Summit Wraps Up

Police used water cannons to disrupt protesters Thursday in Manila, where Asia-Pacific leaders are wrapping up a summit focused on economic issues, territorial disputes and global efforts to combat terrorism.

The left-wing protesters were trying to break a police barricade and gain closer access to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit, which is hosting world leaders including U.S. President Barack Obama.

Renato Reyes of the New Patriotic Alliance says the group rejects the "neo-liberal" proposals being raised at the APEC meeting, which is vetting ways to prop up small and medium businesses.

There were no reports of injuries during the clashes, which occurred about one kilometer from the convention center where the two-day APEC conference ends Thursday.

**法国议会辩论是否要延长紧急状态**

法国议会星期四辩论奥朗德总统提出的建议，将巴黎上星期致命恐怖袭击事件后的紧急状态延长三个月。

法国当局尚不清楚，比利时出生的恐怖分子嫌疑人阿巴乌德，是否在星期三法国警方7小时突袭中被逮捕的8人之中。

巴黎检察官莫林斯说，“目前在公寓楼中被捕的人的身份还没有确认，但是我可以说，阿巴乌德和阿布达斯兰不在其中。”

莫林斯说，至少两人在突袭中被打死。

在星期三的突袭结束后不久，法国总统奥朗德对法国的一些市长说，政府将向地方警察提供更新的装备和武器。

奥朗德计划下星期在华盛顿同奥巴马总统举行磋商，讨论强化打击伊斯兰国战役的措施。奥朗德还将在11月26日在莫斯科会晤俄罗斯总统普京。

French lawmakers debate whether to continue state of emergency

French lawmakers are debating a proposal by President Francois Hollande to extend the state of emergency for three months following last week's deadly attacks in Paris.

French authorities are not sure if the Belgian-born terror suspect, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, was one of the people inside an apartment stormed Wednesday in a seven-hour raid by French police.

Paris Prosecutor, Francois Molins, said: "Currently, the identities of those arrested in the flat have not been confirmed. But I can say, Abdelhamid Abaaoud and Salah Abdeslam were not among the eight being arrested."

The French prosecutor said at least two people were killed during the raid.

Shortly after Wednesday's siege ended, French President Francois Hollande told a group of the country's mayors that the government will help better supply local police with equipment and firearms.

Hollande is scheduled to discuss ways to intensify the campaign targeting IS with U.S. President Barack Obama next week in Washington, and is to meet November 26 with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.
