**斯洛维尼亚将修建临时障碍物**

欧盟成员国斯洛维尼亚计划要在同克罗地亚接壤的边界地带修建障碍物，背景是，这个星期预计有新一波难民要经过这一地区涌向北欧。

不过，斯洛维尼亚总理采拉尔坚持说，该国的边界将保持开放。上个月，在匈牙利关闭了其南部过境点以后，斯洛维尼亚成为了数千名难民逃难所经之路。

斯洛维尼亚总理星期二说：“我们昨天决定开始在今后几天内，在同克罗地亚接壤的申根边界地带修建临时的技术性的障碍物。”

他表示，“这些障碍物，包括可能需要的栅栏，目的是要将难民们朝着过境点导引；我们不会关闭边境的。”

Slovenia to Build "Obstacles" Against Migrants on Border with Croatia

EU member Slovenia plans to build "obstacles" on its border with Croatia in advance of an expected new spike in migrants bound for northern Europe this week.

But Prime Minister Miro Cerar, whose country last month found itself on the main Balkans route for thousands of migrants after Hungary sealed its southern borders, insisted that its frontier would remain open.

"We decided yesterday to start building over the following days on the Schengen border with Croatia some temporary technical obstacles," Cerar said Tuesday in the capital, Ljubljana.

"These obstacles, including fences if needed, will have the objective of directing migrants towards the border crossings. We are not closing our borders," he said.


**欧盟：庇护申请手续缓慢，几乎停滞**

欧盟说，外国移民寻求避难的申请过程极为缓慢，如果现在移民马上停止涌入，仍需要一年时间处理所有申请。

总部设在马耳他的欧洲庇护服务办事处星期二公布这一分析报告的同时，数千名大部分来自战火纷飞的叙利亚和阿富汗的移民每天继续抵达希腊岛屿，之后他们向西穿过巴尔干国家前往西欧。意大利过去一年也有大批移民涌入，其中大多数来自非洲和亚洲。

欧洲庇护服务办事处的数据显示，到9月份为止有80万份要求避难的申请。

办事处说，几乎每三名移民中就有一人等候申请处理至少三个月，有20万申请者等候了六个月或更长。

欧盟将与非洲首脑们在马耳他举行两天的峰会。在这之前，欧洲庇护服务办事表示只从欧盟国家得到了处理庇护申请的工作人员人数的一半。

办事处表示曾提出需要370多名工作人员，但是目前为止只得到177名庇护专家。这大大放慢了处理的速度，以致自上个月欧盟批准移民搬迁计划以来，只有147名移民正式迁移到瑞典、芬兰、卢森堡、法国和西班牙。

EU: Asylum Processing Slowed to Near Standstill

The European Union says its asylum processing is so clogged with foreign migrants seeking refuge that it would take a year to process all pending applications if the migrant influx stopped immediately.

That analysis from the Malta-based European Asylum Support Office came Tuesday, as thousands of migrants - many of them from war-torn Syria and Afghanistan - continued arriving daily on Greek islands before pushing westward through the Balkans to western Europe. Italy has also been inundated in the past year with migrants, mostly from Africa and Asia.

The EASO released data showing a backlog of 800,000 applications for international protection through September.

It also said almost one in three migrants has been waiting at least three months for applications to be processed, and said 200,000 applicants have been waiting six months or longer.

Ahead of a two-day EU summit in Malta with African heads of state, the EASO also said it had received fewer than half the workers requested from EU countries to process asylum applications.

It said it had asked for more than 370 workers, but that only 177 asylum experts had so far been provided, slowing the process so much that only 147 migrants have been officially relocated in Sweden, Finland, Luxembourg, France and Spain since a EU relocation plan was approved last month.
