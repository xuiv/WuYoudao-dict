**伊朗核协议周日开始实施**

根据协议的规定，协议的签署各方必须要在联合国认可90天、也就是10月18日这一天，将这一被称为是“联合全面行动计划”的协议纳入实施。

美国国务卿克里这个星期表示，上述协议的达成以及纳入实施将在未来很长年里都具有影响力。

他说：“中东地区目前仍然是一个问题重重的区域，但是假如各国都朝着研发核武器的方向发展的话，那么这一区域的所有问题都会变得更为不堪。”

不过，就在上述协议即将纳入实施之前的一天，伊朗方面进行中程导弹试射的行为，无疑让局面变得不那么简单。上述中程导弹可以用来发射核武器。

美国外交政策理事会的伯尔曼在接受美国之音采访时说，尽管伊朗测试导弹的行为并没有从文字上违犯今年七月间达成的核协议，但是从精神上违犯了各方达成的协议。

他说：“美国政府在同伊朗方面进行协商的时候，同意将弹道导弹方面的事宜排除在‘协议’之外，我认为，这是一个非常严重的、战略性的错误；我们现在已经在为这一错误‘买单’了。”

Sunday is 'Adoption Day' for Iran Nuclear Deal

October 18th has been dubbed Adoption Day – the day when both sides begin taking steps to carry out the provisions of the Iran nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).

Secretary of State John Kerry says a finalized deal could have ramifications for years to come.

“The Middle East remains a deeply troubled place, but every problem in the region would be made much worse if countries were to move towards nuclear weapons,” said Kerry in a speech at Indiana University this week.

Ahead of Adoption Day, Iran muddied the waters by test-firing a medium range missile that may be capable of delivering a nuclear weapon.

While Iran’s ballistic missile test does not violate the “letter” of the JCPOA, it does violate the “spirit” of the agreement, said Ilan Berman, Vice President of the American Foreign Policy Council.

“The (U.S.) administration, I think, made a tremendous strategic error in agreeing with the Iranians to take ballistic missiles out of the scope of the work of the JCPOA, and it is an effort that I think we are paying for now,” he said.


**台风巨爵登陆菲律宾造成特大暴雨**

移动缓慢的台风“巨爵”星期天袭击了菲律宾北部地区，造成至少一人死亡，数千居民疏散。

台风登陆后强度有所减弱，但是强风暴雨仍然破坏了电线和通讯电缆。这种天气可能会一直持续到星期三。

数万人面临断电的情况。还有一些地方严重积水。台风导致了北部主要岛屿吕宋岛的航班和轮渡取消。

气象预报说，由于北部处在高气压区，同时又有一个台风在西北太平洋洋面上形成，“巨爵”将在吕宋岛停留数日。

气象预报说，台风“巨爵”可能会在未来几天给菲律宾带来多达600毫米的降雨。

Typhoon Koppu Hits Philippines With Torrential Rains

Slow moving Typhoon Koppu slammed into the northern Philippines Sunday, killing at least one person and causing thousands to evacuate their homes.

The storm, which has weakened slightly since coming ashore, is still downing power and communication lines with powerful winds and rains that could last until Wednesday.

Tens of thousands are without power and some areas have already been overwhelmed by floodwaters. The typhoon has also disrupted flights and ferry service across the main northern island of Luzon.

Weather forecasters say Koppu will remain over Luzon for several days due to a high pressure area in the north and another typhoon in the northwest Pacific.

Forecasters predict the storm could dump 600 millimeters of rain over the next several days.
