**印巴关系破裂以来首次举行高层会谈**

印度和巴基斯坦外交官星期二在伊斯兰堡举行会晤。这是去年后半年双方关系破裂以来两国首次举行高层会谈。

在相机镜头上印度外交国务秘书苏杰生和巴基斯坦外交秘书乔杜里微笑握手，并和代表团成员寒暄。

预计苏杰生还将与巴基斯坦总理谢里夫的外交事务和国家安全顾问阿齐兹举行会谈。

印巴两国原定去年8月举行会谈，但印度在巴基斯坦驻印大使会见克什米尔分离分子之后宣布取消会谈。

此后两国军队在克什米尔地区多次发生冲突，导致紧张局势升级。印巴两国曾因克什米尔争端两次爆发战争。

India, Pakistan Renew Talks

India's foreign secretary met with his Pakistani counterpart Tuesday in Islamabad for the first high-level talks between the rival neighbors since relations broke down late last year.

Cameras captured India's Subrahmanyan Jaishankar and Pakistan's Aizaz Chaudhry smiling as they shook hands and spoke along with delegations from each country.

Jaishankar was also expected to meet with Sartaj Aziz, the foreign affairs and national security adviser for Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.

India and Pakistan were due to hold talks last August, but India canceled the meeting citing a meeting between Pakistan's ambassador to New Delhi and Kashmiri separatists.

Tensions further escalated with several clashes between soldiers of the two countries in Kashmir, an area that has been the subject of two wars between India and Pakistan.


**伊拉克部队努力收复提克里特**

伊拉克部队和民兵武装星期二继续对提克里特附近的伊斯兰国组织发动攻势，努力收复这个去年6月被激进分子占领的城市。

地面部队分多路进攻，但军事指挥官说，路边炸弹延缓了进攻速度。

参加这次行动的有大约3万名伊拉克安全部队、什叶派民兵和库尔德武装。伊拉克空军也对目标展开了空袭行动。

特克里特的胜利将为伊拉克部队挺进摩苏尔提供一个前沿阵地。摩苏尔是伊拉克第二大城市，也是伊斯兰国激进组织的大本营和指挥中心。

提克里特是2003年被废黜并处死的伊拉克前独裁者萨达姆•侯赛因的家乡。

Iraqi Forces Continue Fight to Recapture Tikrit

Iraqi troops and militia fighters continued their offensive against the Islamic State group near Tikrit on Tuesday, as they try to recapture the city that fell to the militants last June.

Ground troops have been advancing on multiple fronts, but military commanders said their progress is being slowed by roadside bombs.

An estimated 30,000 members of Iraq's security forces, Shi'ite militias and Kurdish peshmerga fighters are taking part in the operation that also includes airstrikes from Iraq's air force.

A victory in Tikrit would be a geographic stepping stone for Iraqi forces to approach Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city that serves as a stronghold and nerve-center for the Islamic State group.

Tikrit is also the hometown of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, who was executed after his ouster in 2003.
