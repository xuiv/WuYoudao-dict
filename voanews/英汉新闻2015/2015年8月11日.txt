**中国央行宣布人民币贬值1.9%**

中国的中央银行星期二宣布人民币贬值，同时表示这是一次性举措，目的是让人民币汇率更符合市场状况。

按照规定，人民币汇率可在中国人民银行每天设定的中间价上下2%区间浮动。中国人民银行因此将人民币汇率中间价降低了1.9%，并称此举会增强“以市场为导向和中间价的基准地位。”

中国人民银行说，从星期二开始，人民币中间价将反映上一天的收盘价，并综合考虑外汇市场的供求状况以及各主要货币汇率的浮动情况。

人民币贬值将使中国出口产品的价格更低。在中国人民银行星期二决定人民币贬值之前，中国公布的数据显示7月份出口额比去年同期减少8%以上。

China Weakens Yuan in Rate Reform

China's central bank devalued its currency Tuesday in what it said was a one-time move to make rates more market-oriented.

The yuan is allowed to fluctuate 2 percent above or below a central point set daily by the People's Bank of China (PBOC). The PBOC cut the central rate by 1.9 percent as a result of the change that it said would enhance "the market-orientation and benchmark status of central parity."

Beginning Tuesday, the PBOC said the central point would reflect the previous day's closing price "in conjunction with demand and supply condition in the foreign exchange market and exchange rate movement of the major currencies."

A drop in the yuan will make China's exports cheaper overseas. Tuesday's move follows the announcement that July exports were down more than 8 percent from the same time last year.

**希拉里向法院申明相关电邮已全部上交**

前美国国务卿希拉里·克林顿在一份正式法庭文件上签字，声明她已全部上交在担任国务卿期间由私人电邮帐号收发的相关电子邮件。

星期一，希拉里·克林顿签署的声明递交到联邦法院，如法院断定她故意提供不实信息，将以伪证罪予以惩处。

希拉里·克林顿正在争取获得民主党2016年总统候选人提名。几个月前，希拉里·克林顿在担任国务卿期间使用私人电邮帐号一事曝光后，她一直受到质疑。她表示，已把5万5千多页电子邮件交给国务院，并授权国务院将这些电邮公诸于众。

美国司法部正在考虑就希拉里·克林顿的电邮可能涉及机密信息展开调查，但表示这并非刑事调查。希拉里·克林顿上星期在爱荷华州的竞选活动中说，她从未使用私人电邮帐号收发秘密信息。

Clinton Says She Turned Over Emails in Court Statement

Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has signed an official court document declaring that she has turned over all relevant emails sent and received on her personal email account during her tenure as the nation's top diplomat.

The statement signed by Clinton was filed in federal court on Monday, and comes with the penalty of perjury if the court determines she purposely falsified any information.

Clinton, who is seeking the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, has been under scrutiny in recent months after it was revealed she used her personal email account to send official messages. She said she has turned over 55,000 pages of emails to the State Department, and has authorized the agency to make the emails public.

The statement was filed as part of a lawsuit filed by Judicial Watch, a conservative group seeking access to information about Clinton related to her tenure at the State Department during President Barack Obama's first term.

The U.S. Justice Department is considering an investigation into a possible compromise of sensitive information in Clinton's emails, but says it would not be a criminal probe. During a campaign appearance in Iowa last week, Clinton said she never sent or received classified information through her personal account.
