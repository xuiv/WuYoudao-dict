**瑞士太阳能飞机开始环球飞行**

瑞士制造的一架太阳能飞机星期一清晨从阿布扎比起飞。制造者们希望这架飞机能够首次完成无燃料环球飞行。

用碳纤维材料制造的单人座“太阳能动力2号”翼展为72米，超过波音747，重量则仅相当于一辆汽车。安装在机翼上的1万7千个太阳能电池储存能量，以供夜间飞行。

制造“太阳能动力2号”费时12年。设计者是瑞士科学家皮卡德和博奇伯格。

Solar Powered Plane Lifts Off on World Tour

A solar-powered Swiss airplane took off from Abu Dhabi early Monday on the first leg of what its creators hope will be the first around-the-world journey without any fuel.

The carbon fiber single-seater Solar Impulse 2 aircraft has a 72-meter wingspan, which is longer than the wingspan of a Boeing 747, and weighs about as much as a car. The 17,000 solar cells built into the wings harness the sun's energy, allowing it to fly through the night.

The Si2 took 12 years to build and is the brainchild of two Swiss scientists - Bertrand Piccard and Andre Borschberg.

**朴槿惠到医院探望驻韩大使李柏特**

韩国总统朴槿惠星期一探望了美国驻韩大使李柏特。上星期，李柏特被一名持刀凶手割伤。

上星期四，李柏特在首尔一个会议厅准备发表演讲时，一名同情朝鲜的活动分子割伤了他的脸部和手腕。

朴槿惠刚刚结束中东之行返回韩国。她上星期五对李柏特说，她曾遭到和李柏特同样的袭击，因此感到心痛。2006年，朴槿惠在首尔竞选时被袭击者用刀割伤脸部，为她治疗的医院正是李柏特目前所在的医院。

有关当局星期日说，55岁的嫌疑人金基宗可能被控谋杀罪。

Park Visits Hospitalized US Ambassador

South Korean President Park Geun-hye on Monday visited hospitalized U.S. Ambassador Mark Lippert, who was slashed in a knife attack last week.

An activist and North Korean sympathizer slashed Lippert on the face and wrist Thursday as he prepared to give a speech at a lecture hall in Seoul.

Ms. Park - shortly after returning home from a Middle East tour - told Lippert on Friday that her heart ached because he had suffered the same type of attack that she once had. Ms. Park was slashed in the face during an election campaign in Seoul in 2006. She was cared for at the same hospital where Lippert is being treated.

Authorities said Sunday that the suspect, 55-year-old Kim Ki-jong, faces possible attempted murder charges.
