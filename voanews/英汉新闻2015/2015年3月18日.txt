**内塔尼亚胡的利库德集团赢得议会选举**

以色列总理内塔尼亚胡星期三说，他准备在两至三周内着手组建政府。内塔尼亚胡的利库德集团在以色列议会选举中获胜后，他将得到第四个总理任期。

目前几乎所有选票都已清点完毕，利库德集团赢得30个议席，其主要竞争对手犹太复国主义联盟获得24个议席。

内塔尼亚胡的办公室发表声明说，他已经开始与较小党派进行接触，以获得组建执政联盟所需的61个议席。一个关键因素将是持中间立场的全民党。该党在星期二的选举中赢得10个议席。

内塔尼亚胡说：“以色列人民期待我们迅速建立一个领导层，致力于安全、经济和社会等方面的工作，我们曾承诺这样做，我们也会这样做。”

犹太复国主义联盟领袖赫尔佐克承认败选，并给内塔尼亚胡打电话表示祝贺。他对支持者们说，犹太复国主义联盟作为反对派的一员，将继续为以色列人民工作。

Netanyahu's Likud Party Wins Israeli Parliament Election

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday he intends to try to form a government in the next two to three weeks, which would give him a fourth term as prime minister, after his conservative Likud party won Israel's parliamentary election.

With nearly all of the ballots counted, Likud captured 30 seats to beat out the 24 seats for its main challenger, the Zionist Union.

A statement from Mr. Netanyahu's office said he has already reached out to smaller parties in order to form the 61-seat coalition he needs to govern. One key will be the centrist Kulanu party, which won 10 seats in Tuesday's vote.

"The citizens of Israel expect us to quickly put together a leadership that will work for them regarding security, economy and society as we committed to do, and we will do so," Netanyahu said.

Zionist Union leader Isaac Herzog conceded defeat in the election and said he congratulated Mr. Netanyahu in a phone call. Herzog also told reporters his party will continue working for the Israeli people as a member of the opposition.


**朝韩代表将商谈开城工业园区工资问题**

朝鲜官员星期三将会见韩国公司代表，双方在一个联营工业园区的工资问题上存在争执。

平壤试图单方面提高开城工业园区内朝鲜工人的工资。该园区位于朝鲜半岛南北边界的朝鲜一侧。首尔对此表示反对，认为提高工资必须得到双方的同意。

开城的韩国企业委员会负责人郑起燮说，他认为这一争端可以通过对话得到解决。双方将在开城举行会谈。

平壤上个月知会首尔，朝鲜将从3月开始把本国工人的最低月薪从70.35美元提高到74美元。

在开城工业园区，约120家韩国工厂雇用着5万3千多名朝鲜工人。开城工业园区是朝鲜和韩国极少的几个经济合作项目之一。

South Korean Delegation to Meet Pyongyang Officials over Kaesong Dispute

North Korean officials are set to meet Wednesday with representatives of South Korean companies, amid a dispute over wages at a jointly run industrial complex.

Pyongyang is trying to unilaterally raise wages for North Korean workers at the Kaesong Industrial Complex, which lies just north of the two countries' tense border. Seoul objects, saying such a move must be agreed to by both sides.

Chung Ki-sup, the head of the council of South Korean businesses in Kaesong, said he believes the dispute can be resolved through dialogue. The two sides are meeting at Kaesong.

Last month, Pyongyang notified Seoul of its decision to raise the minimum monthly wage for its workers from $70.35 to $74.00 starting in March.

More than 53,000 North Korean workers are employed by about 120 South Korean factories in the park, which is one of the few areas of North-South economic cooperation.
