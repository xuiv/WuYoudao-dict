Greece Putting Final Touches on Reforms to Extend Bailout

Greek officials are putting the final touches on economic reform proposals that are due to their European creditors on Monday, as part of a deal to extend the Greek bailout for four months.

European finance ministers on Friday gave Greece the Monday deadline to present proposals that would convince the country's creditors to grant the four-month extension.

The proposals are aimed at reviving the country's faltering economy and cutting government spending in exchange for renewing the almost $300 billion in loans that are set to expire this week.

Nikos Pappas, minister of state in the new leftist Greek government, said on Sunday officials are working to make the government's civil service "more effective and to combat tax evasion."

US Defense Secretary Carter to Chair Meeting on IS in Kuwait

New U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter will hold talks on Monday in Kuwait with top U.S. commanders and diplomats on U.S. efforts to fight the Islamic State group.

Carter flew to Kuwait City from Afghanistan to chair the meeting at the U.S. Army base of Camp Arifjan. In addition to military officers, U.S. ambassadors from Jordan and elsewhere in the Middle East will participate in the talks.

Officials say the meeting is not expected to produce a new strategy to fight the Islamic State, but to allow Carter to better understand the range of efforts being pursued to defeat the militant group.

On Sunday, Carter visited southern Afghanistan to review plans to withdraw U.S. troops from the country within two years. He met with U.S. soldiers at the American base in Kandahar and received briefings on the status of coalition efforts to train, advise and assist Afghan forces.
