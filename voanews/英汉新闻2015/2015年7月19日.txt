**南卡来罗纳州抗议**

星期天，美国南卡来罗纳州议会外平静无事。之前主张白人至上的组织三K党的部分成员星期六在州议会外集会，抗议南卡取下内战纪念碑悬挂的邦联旗帜，他们与在附近示威的非洲裔美国人发生对峙。

南卡州府哥伦比亚的警方逮捕了几个人。但是没有关于有人受伤的报道。双方互相嘲讽和互喊。

人数远不及对方的三K党成员最后在警察的护送下离开州议会所在地。

南卡查尔斯顿市一著名黑人教堂6月发生枪击案，有9名黑人被打死。 州议会随后通过法案，禁止在州议会外悬挂内战中代表南方一些州的邦联旗帜。

批评者认为邦联旗帜是对黑人种族仇恨的历史象征。

South Carolina Protests

All is calm outside the southern U.S. South Carolina statehouse Sunday, a day after scuffles broke out when the white supremacy group Ku Klux Klan protesting the removal of the Confederate flag came face-to-face with African-American activists demonstrating nearby.

Police in the state capital, Columbia, made several arrests, but there were no reports of injuries as protesters from both sides taunted and yelled at each other.

Police eventually escorted the outnumbered Ku Klux Klan members from the grounds of the state capitol, as others dispersed.

The Confederate flag, viewed by opponents as a historic symbol of racial hatred toward blacks, was removed from the statehouse grounds in response to last month's killings of nine black church-goers in the city of Charleston.

Former US President Released From Hospital

Former U.S. president George H. W. Bush has been released from a hospital in Maine, four days after he fell and broke a bone in his neck.

The 91-year-old Mr. Bush, the oldest living former president, went into the hospital on Wednesday after breaking a vertebrae while at his summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine.

"He is in good enough condition that they can continue his recovery at home,'' Mr. Bush's spokesman Jim McGrath said.

Mr. Bush fractured his C2 vertebra, the second one below the skull, but it didn't affect his spine. Doctors treating him had called it "a significant injury," but said he was in excellent shape and they anticipated he would make a full recovery.

Mr. Bush, who has Parkinson's disease, was last hospitalized for a week in December due to breathing difficulties.

Mr. Bush is the father of former president George W. Bush and former Florida governor Jeb Bush, who is seeking the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.
