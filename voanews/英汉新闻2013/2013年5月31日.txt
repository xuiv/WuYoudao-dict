**天安门母亲批评习近平未实行政治改革**

“天安门母亲”批评中国国家主席习近平没有实行政治改革，并说他使中国“大踏步地退回到毛式正统”。

总部在纽约的人权组织“中国人权”星期五在其网站上登出天安门母亲的一封公开信。天安门母亲要求中国领导层开始对话，重新评价1989年的六四事件，当时数以千计的抗议者死于北京天安门广场的镇压。

天安门母亲多次敦促中国当局公布所有六四事件死难者的名单，并对死者亲属予以赔偿。

这封公开信说，目前中国社会有“一种弥漫着的绝望感”，并说近年来的中国领导人都不是真正的改革者，习近平也不是。

China's Tiananmen Mothers Denounce Lack of Reforms

A group of families has denounced Chinese President Xi Jinping for failing to launch political reforms, saying he is taking China "backwards towards Maoist orthodoxy."

In an open letter published Friday on the Internet site of the New York-based group, Human Rights in China, the Tiananmen Mothers activist group demanded that the Chinese leadership open a dialogue and reassess the June 4,1989, crackdown at Tiananmen Square in Beijing that killed up to 3,000 protesters.

The group has repeatedly called for China to publish a full list of the names of those who died, and to compensate relatives.

The latest letter says Chinese society is "permeated with a general sense of despair" and that none of China's recent leaders has been a real reformer, including Xi Jinping who was installed as president this year.
