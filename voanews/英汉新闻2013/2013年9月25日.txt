**巴基斯坦地震死亡人数升至327人**

巴基斯坦西南部星期二大地震造成的死亡人数持续上升。有关官员说，地震造成俾路支省阿瓦兰山区成千上万的泥土房在地震中倒塌，至少有327人死亡。

还有数以百计的人受伤并失去家园。

救援人员正试图把受伤灾民送往医院，不过大面积的破坏阻碍了运送伤员的努力。这位官员说，当地的地震幸存者急需帐篷、药品和食物。受灾地区靠近伊朗边界。

军队一直在向灾区空运物资并帮助救灾恢复工作。

美国地质勘探局说，巴基斯坦星期二大地震的震级为7.7级。地震还导致海床上升，形成一个小岛。巴基斯坦新闻频道播放了在巴基斯坦南部海岸线外冒出海面的岩石画面。

Death Toll Rises to 327 in Pakistan Quake

The death toll continues to rise from Tuesday's strong earthquake in southwestern Pakistan. Officials say at least 327 people were killed after thousands of mud homes collapsed in the mountainous Awaran district of Baluchistan province.

Hundreds of other people have been injured and displaced.

Rescue workers are trying to move them to hospitals, but their efforts have been hampered by the widespread destruction. A local official said survivors in the area -- which is near the border with Iran -- are in desperate need of tents, medicine, and food.

Members of Pakistan's military have been airlifted to the area to deliver supplies and help with recovery efforts.

The powerful quake, measured by the U.S. Geological Survey at magnitude 7.7, also caused the seabed to rise and create a small island off Pakistan's southern coast.

**柬埔寨反对党威胁举行全国罢工**

柬埔寨反对党威胁举行全国罢工，与此同时，反对党扩大了针对洪森首相有争议胜选的抗议活动。

柬埔寨救国党领袖桑兰西星期三说，举行一天罢工将是对政府“宪法政变”做出的回应。

柬埔寨反对党拒绝加入议会，除非政府同意对据称7月选举中存在的舞弊行为展开一次独立调查。长期执政的柬埔寨人民党在选举中获胜，得以继续执政。

桑兰西说，柬埔寨救国党不会以“任何方式”与议会或政府合作。他表示，目前该党在议会之外能够发挥最大的作用。桑兰西说，如果执政党“继续无视柬埔寨人民的意愿”，反对党就将举行更多的抗议活动。

在桑兰西发表上述评论的一天前，柬埔寨议会选举洪森担任首相。反对党没有参加星期一的议会议事。柬埔寨救国党说，在与会议员人数不符合规定的情况下，议会开始议事是非法的。

Cambodia's Opposition Threatens Nationwide General Strike

Cambodia's opposition is threatening a general strike as it expands its protest against Prime Minister Hun Sen's disputed election victory.

Cambodia National Rescue Party leader Sam Rainsy said Wednesday the one-day strike would be a response to what he called a "constitutional coup" by the government.

The opposition refuses to take part in parliament unless the government agrees to an independent probe of alleged fraud during a July vote that returned the long-ruling Cambodian People's Party to power.

Rainsy said the CNRP will not cooperate "in any manner" with the legislature or government, arguing that its leverage is "strongest now outside the parliament." He said more protests were possible if the ruling party "continues to ignore the will of the Cambodian people."

His comments come a day after Hun Sen was elected by parliament, which convened without its opposition members on Monday. The CNRP says opening of parliament without the required number of opposition members is illegal.
