**联合国检查人员抵达叙利亚涉嫌发生化武袭击地点**

联合国检查人员抵达大马士革郊区，跟被怀疑受到化学武器袭击的受害者见面，之前叙利亚政府按照国际社会的要求，准许联合国小组进入该地区。

叙利亚国有电视台星期一说，叙利亚军队护送联合国小组前往莫达米亚西南郊区，那里是反政府武装占据的8月21日遭到袭击的地区之一。

叙利亚反对派活动人士说，联合国小组访问了莫达米亚的一家临时医院，跟袭击的受害者谈话，并抽取样本。

反政府武装和叙利亚政府都指责对方用化学武器杀害了数百名平民。

西方国家说，他们认为忠于叙利亚总统阿萨德的军队应对平民死亡负责。美国、英国和法国一直在讨论如何作出反应。这使人觉得，西方有可能对持续了两年的叙利亚冲突进行军事干预。

叙利亚政府的重要盟友俄罗斯的外长说，西方国家没有证据显示叙利亚政府动用了化学武器。


UN Chemical Weapons Team Reaches Damascus Suburb


U.N. inspectors have reached a Damascus suburb to meet victims of suspected chemical weapon attacks, after the Syrian government accepted international demands to grant access to the team.

Syrian state television said Monday that troops escorted the inspectors to the southwestern suburb of Moadamiyeh, one of several rebel-held districts where the August 21st attacks happened.

Syrian opposition activists said the U.N. team visited a makeshift hospital in Moadamiyeh to speak with survivors of the attacks and take samples.

Rebels and the Syrian government have blamed each other for the killings of hundreds of civilians in the incidents.

Western powers say they believe forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad were responsible. Leaders of the United States, Britain and France have been discussing what action to take in response, raising the prospect of Western military intervention in Syria's two-year conflict.

The foreign minister of Russia, a key Assad ally, said Western powers "cannot produce any evidence" that the Syrian government committed the alleged chemical attack.
