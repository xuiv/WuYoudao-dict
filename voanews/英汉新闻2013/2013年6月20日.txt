**中俄抨击美国人口贩运报告把两国降级**

中国和俄罗斯抨击美国有关人口贩卖的报告把两国列入在打击色情人口贩卖和强制劳工方面做得最差的国家之列。

美国国务院星期三公布了有关国际人口贩运的年度报告，把北京和莫斯科的评级降到最低水平，使中俄与朝鲜和伊朗并列。

中国外交部发言人星期四在北京说，中国为打击人口贩运进行了“实实在在”的努力并取得了“有目共睹”的成效，别的国家没有资格以权威自居进行评级。

在莫斯科，俄罗斯外交部示意，美国国务院只不过是按照各国对华盛顿的好感程度来给各国评级。俄罗斯威胁说，如果美国因为评级降低而实施任何制裁，俄方将予以报复。

China, Russia Slam US Report on Human Trafficking

China and Russia are slamming a U.S. report that cited both countries among the world's worst in fighting sex trafficking and forced labor.

In its annual report on human trafficking Wednesday, the U.S. State Department dropped Beijing and Moscow to its lowest possible rating, putting them at the same level as North Korea and Iran.

A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson on Thursday called the report "arbitrary," saying Washington should take an "objective and partial" view of its efforts to fight human trafficking.

In Moscow, Russia's foreign ministry suggested the State Department was simply ranking countries according to their degree of sympathy with Washington. It threatened to retaliate against any sanctions that could result from the designation.

**中国法院判处19名维族人徒刑**

在中国新疆维吾尔族自治区，法院判处19名维族人徒刑，他们被控煽动宗教极端主义以及其他罪名。

中国官方的法制报星期四说，刑期最长的一名被告被判6年监禁，他被控在互联网上发布鼓动圣战和煽动民族仇恨的材料。

法制报说，其他一些被告因其他罪名被判两至5年监禁，罪名包括在公共场合滋事以及在网上散布谣言。

报道中没有说明这些被告所属的民族，但其姓名显示他们来自维吾尔族穆斯林居住的地区。

中国说，目前面临着来自维族极端分子的威胁，他们企图建立一个名为“东突厥斯坦”的独立国家。很多人权组织说，北京夸大这一威胁，以证明对穆斯林组织实行高压政策以及严密监视的合理性。

China Sentences Uighurs to Jail on 'Religious Extremism' Charges

Chinese courts in the predominantly Muslim, northwest region of Xinjiang have sentenced 19 ethnic Uighurs to prison for inciting religious extremism and other related charges.

The official Legal Daily said Thursday the toughest sentence of six years in jail was given to a suspect who posted Internet material promoting holy war and ethnic hatred.

Some of the other suspects, it said, were given between two and five years in jail on other charges, including creating a public nuisance and spreading rumors online.

While the report did not specify the ethnicity of the suspects, their names indicated they were from the Turkic-speaking, predominantly Muslim Uighur community.

China says it faces a growing threat from Uighur extremists who want to form a separate state called East Turkistan. Many rights groups say Beijing is exaggerating the threat to justify its heavy police presence and close monitoring or Muslim institutions.
