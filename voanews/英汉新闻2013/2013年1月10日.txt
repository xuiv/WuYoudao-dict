** 举行罢工抗议新闻检查后 《南方周末》按时出版**

中国报刊《南方周末》本周已经按时出版，但呼吁北京对其媒体控制政策进行改革。此前《南方周末》的新闻工作人员举行罢工，抗议政府当局的新闻检查。

星期四，这家总部在广州的《南方周末》可以在中国几个地区买到，此前有报道说，中共官员与这家先进的《南方周末》的编辑们达成了一项初步协议。

最新一期的《南方周末》中没有直接提及这场争论，但发表社论说，北京控制媒体的方式必须适应时代潮流，并呼吁对理性、有建设性的媒体加以保护，这是《南方周末》继续抗争的一个微妙迹象。

与此同时，抗议者连续第四天聚集在戒备森严的《南方周末》报社门外，似乎是在考验当局的耐心。至少两名示威者被便衣警察拖走。星期四，采访记者也被要求离开。

此外，社会媒体上继续不断发出抗议的言论，尽管新闻检查人员竭力限制对《南方周末》事件的讨论，而很多中国名人和公众人物在网上对《南方周末》表示支持。

**Following Strike over Censorship, Southern Weekly Publishes Weekly Edition as scheduled**

A Chinese newspaper where journalists had gone on strike to protest government censorship has published its weekly issue as scheduled, but is urging Beijing to reform its media control policies.

The Guangzhou-based Southern Weekly was available in several parts of the country Thursday, following reports that editors at the progressive paper had reached a tentative deal with Communist Party officials.

The latest issue made no direct mention of the dispute. But in a subtle sign of continued resistance, it published an editorial that said Beijing's methods of controlling the media must "keep with the times," and called for "reasonable and constructive media" to be protected.

Meanwhile, protesters gathered for a fourth straight day outside the newspaper's heavily guarded headquarters, apparently testing the patience of authorities. At least two demonstrators were hauled away by plainclothes police. Journalists were also ushered away from the building Thursday.

Protests also continued on social media, where many Chinese celebrities and public figures have expressed support for the paper, despite censors' efforts to limit discussion on the matter.

**卡尔扎伊将与美国官方讨论阿富汗前途问题**

阿富汗总统卡尔扎伊星期四将在华盛顿会晤美国国防部长帕内塔和国务卿希拉里·克林顿，同时奥巴马总统领导的行政当局正在考虑美国未来在阿富汗的军事存在问题。

星期四上午，国防部五角大楼将为卡尔扎伊举行阅兵式，随后卡尔扎伊将与帕内塔举行会谈。

预定日程，卡尔扎伊将在星期四傍晚会晤希拉里·克林顿。会谈结束后，他将与希拉里·克林顿共进工作晚餐。

卡尔扎伊在五角大楼和国务院进行会谈的一天后，将单独会晤美国总统奥巴马。预计两位领导人将讨论安全问题，即大部分美国军队于2014年撤离阿富汗后，美国在阿富汗可能的驻军人数和条件。

目前的计划规定到2014年底美国将撤离几乎全部驻守在阿富汗的6万8千名部队。

但是，有关进行那项计划将根据很多情况而定，包括阿富汗军队届时是否有能力接管安全事务。此外，如果将来有美军留驻阿富汗，目前还不清楚他们的使命。

**Karzai, U.S. Officials Consider Afghan Future **

Afghan President Hamid Karzai is set to meet in Washington Thursday with U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as the Obama administration deliberates the U.S. military future in Afghanistan.

Mr. Karzai is set to meet with Panetta early in the day Thursday, following a full military honors ceremony to welcome him to the Pentagon.

He is scheduled to meet with Secretary Clinton in the early evening and will then join her for a working dinner.

Mr. Karzai's talks at the Pentagon and the State Department come one day ahead of a one-on-one meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama. The two leaders are expected to discuss security issues, namely how many U.S. troops might be stationed in Afghanistan after the majority pull out in 2014, and under what conditions.

Current plans call for the United States to withdraw nearly all of its 68,000 troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2014.

But that plan hinges on a number of conditions, including whether Afghan forces will be capable of taking over security at that time. It is also not clear what would be the role of the Americans who stay behind, if any do remain.
