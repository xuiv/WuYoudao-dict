**Sweltering Temperatures Prompt Heat Advisory across China**

A record heat wave across much of China has claimed several lives and prompted Chinese authorities to issue an emergency heat advisory.

The state-run Xinhua news agency says local officials reported over 10 deaths from heatstroke in Shanghai, which has seen nine straight days of temperatures over 38 degrees Celsius. Officials say this is Shanghai's hottest July in 140 years.

For the first time ever, the China Meteorological Administration has issued a level two emergency response, warning citizens to cut down on outdoor activity and make sure they have access to air conditioning inside.

**柬埔寨反对党声称赢得星期天的议会选举**

柬埔寨反对党声称赢得了星期天举行的议会选举，之前反对党拒绝接受他们所说的充斥舞弊的选举结果。

柬埔寨全国救国党星期三称，该党的点票数据显示他们在议会取得了至少63个席位，而执政的柬埔寨人民党只得到60个席位。

政府星期天公布的初步结果显示，柬埔寨人民党赢得了68个席位。这个数字比上一届赢得的多数席位有明显的减少，但足以让长期执政的洪森再次掌权。

柬埔寨全国救国党由反对派领袖桑兰西领导，该党星期三开会，收集选举舞弊的证据，同时国际观察员也不断指出选举有舞弊行为。

桑兰西说，他希望这些证据能够支持他所说的范围广泛的选举舞弊。桑兰西的救国党呼吁联合国支持对选举进行调查。

**Cambodia Opposition Claims Win in Sunday Election**

Cambodia's opposition is claiming victory in Sunday's parliamentary election, stepping up its rejection of the results of a vote it says was marred by fraud.

The Cambodia National Rescue Party ((CNRP)) said Wednesday its own polling data shows it won at least 63 parliamentary seats, compared to just 60 seats for the ruling Cambodian People's Party ((CPP)).

The government's preliminary figures released Sunday showed the CCP winning 68 seats - a significantly reduced majority from last election - but enough to return longtime Prime Minister Hun Sen to power.

The CNRP, led by opposition leader Sam Rainsy, gathered Wednesday to collect evidence of alleged irregularities, as accusations of fraud continue to pour in from international observers.

Rainsy says he hopes the evidence can bolster the party's call for a United Nations-backed investigation into what he says is widespread electoral fraud.
