**美国国防部将取消不准女兵执行战斗任务的禁令**

一名五角大楼高级官员表示，美国国防部长帕内塔将取消军中女兵不得参与战斗的禁令。

这名官员说，帕内塔将在星期四正式宣布取消这一禁令。这位官员还说，这是帕内塔自2011年担任国防部长后一直想要做的事情。帕内塔在过去两年中为女性提供了5万个军中的工作机会。

这位官员表示，帕内塔要军中各首长到5月时拟出执行这项新政策的计划。这项新政策将为美国陆军、海军、空军、海军陆战队以及海岸警卫队的所有军中女性提供数千个在前线的战斗职位。

在美国军队，担任战斗职位一向对军人升迁至关重要。长期以来，在美国军队服役的女性表示由于没有重视她们实际的服务，而在升迁问题上受到不公平的压制。

军中女性在未来还可能被排除在某些战斗任务外，而且将必须为每项任务达到严格的体能标准。美国国防部官员表示，美国各军种首长将有3年的时间来研究这个问题。

**Pentagon to Lift Ban on Combat Duty for Women **

A top Pentagon official says U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta is lifting the ban that keeps women from combat duty in the military.

The official says Panetta will make a formal announcement Thursday, adding that this is something Panetta has wanted to do since becoming defense chief in 2011. He already has opened 50,000 military jobs to women in the last two years.

The official says Panetta is giving military chiefs until May to draw up plans for implementing the new policy, which could open thousands of frontline combat positions to women in all U.S. military services -- Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard.

In the military, serving in combat positions remains key to career advancement. Women have long said that by not recognizing their real service, the military has unfairly held them back.

Women still may be excluded from some combat jobs in the future and will have to meet strict physical requirements for every job. The Pentagon official says the chiefs of U.S. military services will have three years to study that issue.

**克里周四将就出任国务卿出席国会听证会**

星期四，美国国会参议院外交委员会主席、参议员约翰·克里将出席国会就他被提名出任国务卿而举行的听证会。

预计，这位前民主党总统候选人克里将被问及有关他在越南服役、叙利亚危机以及拟议中的拱顶石输油管工程等问题。拱顶石输油管将从加拿大连接到美国南部的德克萨斯州。

克里是美国最富有的参议员之一，他已经排除了国会认可这项任命的一个可能的障碍，那就是他承诺卖掉在一些公司大批股票，如果他担任美国外交最高首长的国务卿，持有这些公司的股票可能会形成利益冲突。他持有股票的公司包括了与美国政府有生意往来的公司，还有一些可能会受到外交决策影响的公司。

克里的资产估计约为1亿8400万美元。

预计克里将会顺利得到国会通过对他的任命。

**Kerry to Face Confirmation Hearing Thursday **

U.S. Senator John Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee, is set to face his peers Thursday at a confirmation hearing for his nomination as secretary of state.

The former Democratic presidential candidate is expected to face questions about his military service in Vietnam, the crisis in Syria, and the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline that would run from Canada to the southern U.S. state of Texas.

Kerry, one of the wealthiest U.S. senators, already has remedied one possible roadblock to his confirmation by promising to divest his expansive holdings in companies that could prove a conflict of interest to the nation's top diplomat. Those holdings include companies that do business with the U.S. government and others that could be affected by diplomatic decisions.

Kerry's fortune is estimated at $184 million.

Kerry is expected to easily win confirmation.
