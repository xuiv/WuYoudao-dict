**中印总理讨论边界贸易问题**

印度总理辛格与到访的中国总理李克强在解决边界纠纷和其他紧张关系方面达成一致，这是李克强总理任职以来首次出访国外。

辛格与李克强星期一在新德里讨论了包括喜马拉雅山西部长期的边界纠纷以及双边贸易中有利于中国的贸易失衡等问题。

在联合新闻发布会上，李克强说，两国的共同利益远远超过彼此间的分歧。辛格表示，双方必须合作，加强互信，争取实现更多的合作。

两位领导人签署了8个不太重要的协议，但是他们都表示，这次会晤的象征意义很重要。

西藏活动人士和反对派支持者在新德里举行抗议活动，印度首都戒备森严。

就在李克强总理为期三天的访印之行开始之际，两国刚刚在一个多星期前和平结束涉及有争议的拉达克地区数千平方公里土地的边界纠纷。中国和印度从来没有最后划定那里的边界线，双方恢复了边境现状之后，紧张才得以缓和。

** Chinese Premier in India, Discusses Borders, Trade**

Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his visiting Chinese counterpart have agreed to resolve a border dispute and other tensions, as Premier Li Keqiang continues his first trip abroad since taking office.

Mr. Singh and Mr. Li met Monday in New Delhi to discuss a range of issues, including the longstanding border dispute in the western Himalayas and a trade imbalance that heavily favors China.

At a joint news conference, Mr. Li said the two nations have far more shared interests than differences. Mr. Singh said both sides must work to strengthen trust and confidence in order to permit greater cooperation.

The two leaders signed eight minor agreements, but both men said the meeting's symbolism was important

There was tight security in the Indian capital, as Tibetan activists and opposition supporters held protests in the city.

The three-day visit came less than two weeks after the peaceful end of a tense military standoff over tens of thousands of square kilometers in the disputed Ladakh region. China and India have never finalized their border there, and tensions subsided only when the two sides restored the status quo.


**缅甸总统吴登盛周一将造访白宫**

缅甸总统吴登盛星期一将成为近半个世纪以来第一位造访白宫的缅甸领导人。

吴登盛曾是一位将军，他在访美期间将会晤奥巴马总统。人权组织和一些政界人士说，缅甸目前存在针对穆斯林的暴力以及继续侵犯人权现象，因此这次访问的时机并不成熟。

有关官员说，预计美国和缅甸将利用这次访问达成一些协议，而这些协议可能推动双方在促进贸易、制定劳工标准以及投资等领域的定期会谈。

** Burmese President to Visit White House**

Burmese President Thein Sein on Monday will become the first leader of his country to visit the White House in nearly half a century.

The former general will meet with President Barack Obama during a visit human rights organizations and some politicians say is premature because of anti-Muslim violence and continuing rights violations in Burma.

Officials say the two countries are expected to use the visit to work out agreements that could lead to regular talks on boosting trade, labor standards and investment.
