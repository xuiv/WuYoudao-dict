**法院公布谷开来提供证词的录像**

审判薄熙来的中国一家法院公布了薄熙来妻子谷开来提供证词的录像，以支持对薄熙来的受贿指控。

谷开来在这段事先录制的11分钟录像中说，她的丈夫知道一名富商送给他家礼物，包括机票、价格昂贵的海鲜和现金。

薄熙来还被控贪污和滥用职权。他坚决否认自己受贿。在星期四举行的第一天庭审中，薄熙来声称谷开来的证词是可笑的。

中国官方的新华社说，薄熙来星期五否认谷开来的证词具有真实性，理由是谷开来的精神状态有问题。新华社的报道说，薄熙来声称谷开来“疯了，经常撒谎”。

自谷开来去年被判因财务纠纷杀害一名英国商人的罪名成立以来，这是她第一次出现在公众视野。这起丑闻最终导致薄熙来戏剧性地垮台。

美国之音中文部记者东方在济南法院附近的一个新闻中心关注庭审过程。他说，检方试图利用谷开来的证词削弱薄熙来自称不了解妻子所作所为的说法。

China Releases Video Testimony of Ousted Politician Bo's Wife

A Chinese court trying former Communist Party politician Bo Xilai has released video testimony of his wife in an attempt to bolster the claim that he knowingly accepted bribes.

In the pre-recorded, 11-minute video, Gu Kailai said her husband was aware that a wealthy businessman had given the family gifts, including airline tickets, expensive seafood and cash.

Bo, who is also charged with embezzlement and abuse of power, has vigorously denied the bribery allegations. On Thursday, the first day of the trial, he dismissed his wife's testimony as "laughable."

The official Xinhua news agency says Bo on Friday denied his wife's testimony by doubting her mental condition. It says he claimed "she is mad and always tells lies."

It is the first time Gu has been seen since she was convicted last year of killing a British businessman over a failed financial dispute, in a scandal that eventually led to Bo's dramatic downfall.

VOA Mandarin Service's Fred Wang, who is watching the trial from a media center near the court in the eastern city of Jinan, says the prosecution is trying to use Gu's testimony to weaken Bo's case that he was not aware of her dealings.


**埃及穆兄会呼吁举行“星期五烈士”大游行**

埃及军方支持的政府释放了被罢黜的前总统穆巴拉克之后，穆斯林兄弟会呼吁星期五举行大规模集会活动。

穆巴拉克这位前军事指挥官统治了埃及29年，星期四他被转送到开罗附近一家军队医院，并在那里受到软禁。

85岁的穆巴拉克正在等待因谋杀指控而出庭受审，这项指控和他在2011年被民众起义赶下台期间数百名抗议者遭到杀害有关。穆巴拉克还受到腐败的指控。

埃及一家法院本周决定释放穆巴拉克，认定此前对他拘禁的裁定超出了法律限制。

这项裁决激怒了穆斯林兄弟会，他们的代表、通过民选产生的领导人穆尔西上个月被军方赶下台，目前仍被关在狱中。

穆兄会和所谓的“反政变联盟”已经发出呼吁，号召进行抗议军方的“星期五烈士”大型示威活动，引发人们对可能出现更多暴力事件的担忧。

Muslim Brotherhood Calls for 'Martyr's Friday' in Egypt

Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood is calling for mass rallies Friday, after the military-backed government released deposed President Hosni Mubarak from prison.

Mr. Mubarak, an ex-military commander who ruled Egypt for 29 years, was transferred Thursday to a military hospital near Cairo, where he will remain under house arrest.

The 85-year-old is awaiting trial for murder in connection with the killing of hundreds of protesters during a popular uprising that forced him from power in 2011. He has also been charged with corruption.

An Egyptian court ordered Mr. Mubarak's release this week, ruling his pre-verdict detention had exceeded legal limits.

The ruling has angered the Muslim Brotherhood, whose democratically elected leader, Mohamed Morsi, was forced from power by the military last month and remains in prison.

The Brotherhood and the so-called "Anti-Coup Alliance" have called for a "Martyr's Friday" of mass demonstrations against the military, raising fears of fresh violence.
