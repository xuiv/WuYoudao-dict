**中国媒体呼吁结成反恐统一战线**

中国国家媒体星期四呼吁结成打击恐怖主义的统一战线，此前天安门广场发生致命撞车事件后，五人被逮捕。

北京说，星期一的撞车事件是新疆宗教极端分子策划的自杀式袭击。长期以来，新疆维吾尔族穆斯林对政府的压制表示不满。

中国警方星期三说，他们相信是乌斯曼•艾山驾驶载有他的妻子与母亲的汽车在天安门广场冲撞人群，然后点燃汽车。这三人当场死亡，并造成两名游客死亡，数十人受伤。

警方说，在被烧毁的汽车里发现了汽油、刀子、铁棍和一面带有极端宗教字样的旗帜。警方还逮捕了来自新疆的五人，据称他们曾与艾山共同策划这起袭击。

中共控制的环球时报星期四说，所有涉案者都是维族人，并说维族将是这次袭击的最大受害者，新疆会采取更加严格的安全措施。

中国官方的中国日报说，袭击者将被作为谋杀者、而不是作为英雄写入历史。中国日报还说，这起袭击的目的是破坏稳定以及建立一个独立的东突厥斯坦。

Chinese Media Call for 'United Front Against Terror' Following Arrests

Chinese state-controlled media on Thursday called for a united front against "terrorism" after five people were arrested in connection with a deadly car crash in Tiananmen Square.

Beijing says the Monday crash was a suicide mission planned by religious extremists from the troubled northwest state of Xinjiang, where the mainly Muslim Uighur ethnic group has long complained of government persecution.

On Wednesday, police said they believe Usmen Hasan crashed a vehicle carrying his mother and wife into a crowd of people in the square, before lighting the car on fire. All three died at the scene, as did two tourists. Dozens were wounded.

Police say they found gasoline, knives, steel sticks and a flag with extremist religious content inside the burnt-out vehicle. They also arrested five people from Xinjiang, who were said to be planning attacks with Hasan.

The Communist Party-controlled Global Times said Thursday all those involved in the incident are Uighurs. It said the minority group will be the "biggest victims" of the attack, noting that Xinjiang will be subject to even tighter security restrictions.

The official China Daily said the attackers will "go down in history as murderers, not heroes." It said the incident was aimed at undermining stability and creating a separate state of East Turkestan.

**前红色高棉领导人农谢在法庭做最终陈词**

星期四，前红色高棉第二号领导人农谢在联合国支持的法庭上做最终陈词，拒绝接受对他的战争罪和反人类罪指控。

农谢在金边法庭上说，他对红色高棉统治下的受害者表示“最深的悔恨”，但他坚称从未指示任何共产党干部犯罪。

现年87的农谢曾是红色高棉的意识形态主管。他说，自己当时是在履行对国家以及“亲爱的人民”的责任。

现年82岁的乔森潘是前红色高棉国家元首，他也在星期四做最终陈词。农谢和乔森潘是还在世的前红色高棉最高级别领导人。红色高棉被指在四年统治期间导致多达2百万柬埔寨人死亡。

检方要求判处农谢和乔森潘无期徒刑，这是最严厉的惩罚。他们拒绝了这些指控，声称并不了解红色高棉统治时期所发生的暴行。预计法庭将于明年上半年做出宣判。

Khmer Rouge Ex-Leaders Give Final Statements at War Crimes Tribunal


The Khmer Rouge's former number two leader denied charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity in his final statement at a United Nations-backed tribunal in Cambodia Thursday.

Nuon Chea told the Phnom Penh court he felt the "deepest remorse" for the victims of the Khmer Rouge, but insisted he never told any of his communist cadres to commit crimes.

The 87-year-old, who served as the Khmer Rouge's chief ideologue, insisted he was carrying out his duty to serve his country and what he called his "beloved people."

Khieu Samphan, the movement's 82-year-old former head of state, is also giving his final statement Thursday. The two men are the most senior living ex-leaders of the Khmer Rouge, which is blamed for the deaths of as many as 2 million Cambodians during its four-year rule.

Prosecutors are seeking the maximum punishment of life in prison for both men, who deny the charges and say they were not aware of the atrocities that took place under their rule. A verdict in the trial is expected in the first half of next year.
