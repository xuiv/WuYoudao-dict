**平壤声称将重新启动宁边核设施**

朝鲜说，将全面重新启动一个关闭的核设施，这一举动使已经高度紧张的朝鲜半岛局势进一步升级。

朝鲜官方的朝中社援引核机构官员的话说，平壤将重新调整并重新启动宁边核设施，以制造更多核弹，同时解决朝鲜的电力短缺问题。

朝中社说，宁边核设施将包括一座铀浓缩工厂和一座五兆瓦反应堆，可以生产含有武器级钸(金+不)的乏燃料棒。宁边核设施于2007年关闭，以换取经济援助。

几星期来，平壤不断发出威胁，此前联合国针对其最近一次进行核试验以及发射卫星而加强制裁朝鲜，平壤对此感到愤怒。

** N. Korea Vows to Restart Stalled Nuclear Complex**

North Korea says it is restarting all operations at a shuttered nuclear reactor, adding to already heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula.

The official Korean Central News Agency quoted officials as saying Pyongyang would "readjust and restart" the facilities at the Yongbyon complex both to build more bombs and address the country's electricity shortage.

It said this will include a uranium enrichment plant and a five megawatt reactor that can generate spent fuel rods laced with weapons-grade plutonium. The reactor was shut down in 2007 in exchange for economic aid.

The move follows weeks of threats by Pyongyang, which is angry at tough United Nations sanctions passed in response to its third nuclear test and latest satellite launch.
**激进分子袭击巴基斯坦电厂打死七人**

巴基斯坦警方说，数十名疑似激进分子袭击了巴基斯坦西北部一座发电厂，打死七人，造成数千居民断电。

有关官员说，这次袭击发生在白沙瓦郊区，拥有迫击炮和火箭榴弹的大约50名激进分子于星期二午夜过后冲进这座发电厂。

警方说，激进分子在袭击现场打死两人，并绑架九人，后来在附近地区发现其中五人已经死亡。目前至少还有四名发电厂工人下落不明。

没有任何组织宣称对这次袭击负责。袭击造成断电后，一些地区已经恢复供电。

巴基斯坦军队采取行动遏制塔利班激进分子，但激进分子继续在半自治的部落区频繁发动袭击。

在巴基斯坦准备在5月11号举行省选举和大选之际，巴基斯坦西北部地区的暴力活动增加。
** Militants Kill 7 in Attack on Pakistan Power Station **

Pakistani police say dozens of suspected militants attacked a power station in the country's northwest, killing seven people and leaving thousands without electricity.

Officials say the assault took place on the outskirts of Peshawar, when about 50 militants, armed with mortars and rocket-propelled grenades, stormed the plant at after midnight Tuesday.

Police say the militants killed two people at the scene of the attack and abducted nine others. Five of those taken were later found dead in a nearby field. At least four power plant workers remain missing.

No group has claimed responsibility for the attack. Power has been restored to some of the areas left dark by the raid.

Taliban militants continue to launch frequent attacks in the semiautonomous tribal regions, despite efforts by the Pakistani military to stem them.

Violence has been increasing in the northwest as Pakistan prepares to hold provincial and general elections on May 11th.
