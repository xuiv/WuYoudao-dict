**韩国将取消南北会谈归咎于朝鲜**

韩国统一部部长柳吉在说，取消首尔与平壤的高层会谈令人遗憾，但这是双方新关系中的必要组成部分。

会谈本来定于星期三在首尔举行，但在最后一刻取消了会谈计划，看来原因是围绕代表团团长人选问题的相对较小的分歧。

柳吉在星期三说，取消会谈的责任在朝鲜方面。他表示，如果朝鲜希望改善与首尔的关系，就必须展示诚意。

韩国官员说，朝鲜拒绝派遣官员参加会谈，原因是平壤对韩国任命一名副部长而不是部长担任代表团团长感到不满。

就在一天前，平壤拒绝接受首尔有关举行部长级谈判的提议。自2007年以来，韩国和朝鲜一直没有举行过部长级谈判。朝鲜没有就举行会谈事宜发表任何公开声明。

首尔星期三表示，韩国使用了双方政府间的热线，但朝鲜方面没有接听。平壤上星期恢复了这一热线，以便就谈判事宜进行协调。

South Korea Blames North for Cancelled Talks

South Korea's unification minister says the cancellation of high-level talks with the North is an unfortunate but necessary part of its new relationship with Pyongyang.

The talks, which were to be held Wednesday in Seoul, were called off at the last minute because of what appears to be a relatively minor disagreement over who would represent each country.

Unification minister Ryoo Kihl-jae said Wednesday the blame for the cancelled talks lies with the North, which he said must show sincerity if it wants improved relations with Seoul.

South Korean officials say the North refused to send officials to the talks because it was offended by the South's nomination of a vice-minister, rather than minister, as its chief delegate.

Just days earlier, Pyongyang had rejected Seoul's offer to hold minister-level negotiations, which the two Koreas have not held since 2007. There has been no public statement by the North on the status of the talks.

Seoul said Wednesday that North Korea is not answering an inter-governmental hotline that Pyongyang restored last week in an effort to coordinate the negotiations.

与此同时， 人权组织说，反政府武装在叙利亚代尔祖尔省东部的一个城镇杀害了几十名什叶派穆斯林。亲反政府武装的叙利亚人权瞭望告诉美国之音，60名受害者中，大都是亲政府的什叶派民兵。

反政府武装在网路上公布的录像显示，几十名枪手举着黑色的伊斯兰教主义旗帜，开枪庆祝。哈特拉的几座建筑冒着烟。叙利亚人权瞭望说，反政府武装占领哈特拉后焚烧了什叶派穆斯林地区的几座住宅。 当地的什叶派穆斯林纷纷逃离。

叙利亚政府官员谴责袭击是“大规模屠杀平民”。

在克里与黑格举行这次会谈之际，美英两国正在考虑采取哪些步骤来实现成立一个叙利亚过渡政府的目标，由过渡政府带领叙利亚摆脱持续两年多的混乱局面。


US, Britain to Discuss Syria Amid Reports of Sectarian Killings

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry hosts his British counterpart for talks Wednesday on Syria, as activists report anti-government rebels killed dozens of Shi'ites in a town in eastern Deir el-Zour province.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a pro-opposition monitoring group that has reported abuses on both sides of the conflict, told VOA most of the 60 victims in the town of Hatla late Tuesday were pro-government Shi'ite militiamen.

A video posted online by rebels showed dozens of gunmen carrying black Islamist flags celebrating and firing guns as smoke curled above several buildings in Hatla. The Observatory said rebels secured control of the town and burned down a number of houses in the Shi'ite district. Shi'ite civilians then fled.

A Syrian government official denounced the attack, calling it a "massacre" of civilians.

In Washington, Kerry and British Foreign Secretary William Hague will consider potential steps to achieve their goal of establishing a transitional government in Syria to lead the country out of more than two years of turmoil.
