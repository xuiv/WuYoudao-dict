**North Korea Readies Rocket Units for Attacks on U.S.**

North Korean state media say leader Kim Jong Un has ordered preparations for rocket strikes on the U.S. mainland and military bases, after two U.S. stealth bombers flew training runs over South Korea.

The official Korean Central News Agency said Mr. Kim put his rocket units on standby Friday, after an overnight emergency meeting with top army commanders. The order came hours after nuclear-capable U.S. B-2 bombers were deployed in ongoing joint military drills with South Korea.

The strategic bombers flew 20,000 kilometers non-stop Thursday from an air force base in the central U.S. to an island off the southwestern coast of the Korean peninsula, before returning to their home base.

The mission was held amid increasing threats by North Korea against South Korea and the United States. Pyongyang has severed all communication links with South Korea, the United Nations and the Red Cross.
