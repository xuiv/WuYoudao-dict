**奥巴马呼吁提高债务上限并支持合理控枪**

美国总统奥巴马呼吁国会尽快通过增加美国借贷上限的法案。奥巴马表示，他支持采取明智的枪支管制新措施，以防止美国出现更多的大型枪杀案。

在开始第二任总统任期的几天前，奥巴马在白宫举行的记者会上说，如果国会中的共和党人不在未来几个星期中考虑提高美国16.4万亿美元的借贷上限，那将是“不负责任”的。

美国目前已经达到债务上限，但在未来几星期中还有足够资金来支付账单。奥巴马总统说，美国必须提高借贷上限，这不是因为政府就此可以增加开支，而是只有这样美国才能兑现已做出的财政承诺。

在枪支管制方面，奥巴马总统说，他期待从他任命的防止枪支暴力特别行动小组那里得到一份“明智而且符合常理的步骤”清单。奥巴马说，他稍后将和负责特别行动小组的副总统拜登碰面，讨论有关提议。

尽管奥巴马拒绝提供细节，但他重申，他相信更严格的背景调查、加紧控制大容量弹匣并禁止攻击性武器都是合理的提议。

在奥巴马举行这次记者会的1个月前，美国东北部的康涅狄克州发生了令人震惊的小学校园枪杀案，导致20名学童和6名成人丧生。
**Obama Calls for Debt Ceiling Increase, Supports 'Sensible' Gun Control **

U.S. President Barack Obama is calling on Congress to quickly approve an increase in the country's borrowing limit and says he supports "sensible" new gun controls to try to prevent more mass shootings in the country.

Less than a week before he starts his second term, Mr. Obama said at a White House news conference Monday that it would be "irresponsible" for his political opponents in Congress to even consider not raising the country's $16.4 trillion borrowing limit in the coming weeks.

The U.S. has already reached the debt ceiling, but has enough money to continue paying its bills for several weeks. The president said the borrowing limit needs to be increased, not so that government spending can be boosted, but so the U.S. can meet financial obligations it has already incurred.

On gun control, the president said he expects to receive a list of "sensible and common sense steps" from his special task force on preventing gun violence. He said he would meet later in the day with Vice President Joe Biden, who chaired the task force, to discuss the proposals.

While he declined to provide specifics, Mr. Obama repeated his stance that he believes that stronger background checks, tighter control of high-capacity ammunition clips and an assault weapons ban are all proposals that make sense.

Mr. Obama's news conference came a month after a man shocked the nation by going on a shooting rampage at an elementary school in the northeastern state of Connecticut, leaving 20 children and six adults dead.

**巴基斯坦军队对反政府示威者使用催泪弹**

在巴基斯坦首都伊斯兰堡，安全部队向空中放枪，并向示威者施放催泪弹。星期二清早，示威者发动游行，要求巴基斯坦政治领导人辞职和解散政府。

示威者聚集在伊斯兰堡的主要街道，举行反腐败抗议活动。他们响应深受民众爱戴的巴基斯坦神职人员卡德里的号召。卡德里呼吁数十万抗议者到议会游行示威。

卡德里的支持者推开警察为阻挡人群而放置的铁丝网和货箱，向议会大厦进发。

卡德里说，他星期二中午将在议会大厦外面向支持者发表讲话，并要求政府下台。

巴基斯坦定于5月中旬举行议会选举，并将在此之前大约两个月解散议会。但卡德里说，政府应当立即下台，以便成立一个临时内阁，清除贪腐和管理不善，他认为这些因素导致了长期能源短缺、经济发展缓慢、犯罪率上升以及塔利班叛乱。

** Pakistani Forces Use Tear Gas on Anti-Government Demonstrators **

Pakistani security forces have fired into the air and lobbed tear gas in Islamabad, where protesters are holding an early morning march and calling on the country's political leaders to resign and dissolve the government.

The demonstrators gathered on one of the city's main thoroughfares for an anti-corruption protest. They were acting at the urging of populist Pakistani cleric Tahir-ul Qadri. He told the tens of thousands of people at the protest to march on parliament.

Qadri's supporters pushed aside barriers of barbed wire and shipping containers that police had erected to contain the crowd.

Qadri said he would speak to his supporters around mid-day outside parliament to press his demand for the government's abdication.

Pakistan is due to hold parliamentary elections in mid-May, and parliament would be dissolved about two months beforehand. But Qadri said the government should step down immediately, to clear the way for an interim Cabinet to root out graft and mismanagement, which he blames for chronic energy shortages, slow economic growth and a rise in crime and Taliban insurgency.
