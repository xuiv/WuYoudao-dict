**朝鲜宣称成功进行核试验 **

平壤说，朝鲜“成功地”进行了第三次核试验。此前联合国一直警告朝鲜，要求停止其研制核武器项目。

朝鲜官方媒体星期二说，这次地下核试验使用了爆炸力大于前两次核试验的“较轻的微型核弹”。朝鲜官方媒体表示，进行这次核试验是针对美国“鲁莽的敌对行为”。

联合国秘书长潘基文立即谴责朝鲜进行核试验将导致严重的不稳定局面，并说朝鲜这一举动明显地严重违反了国际制裁规定。

美国总统奥巴马说，朝鲜这次核试验是严重的挑衅，对美国的安全与国际和平构成威胁。奥巴马敦促国际社会迅速采取可信的行动。

中国表示，“坚决反对”朝鲜进行这次核试验。中国是朝鲜的主要盟友。

联合国外交官们说，安理会将于星期二清晨在纽约举行一次紧急会议，讨论如何对朝鲜核试验做出反应。

** N.Korea Claims 'Successful' Nuclear Test**


North Korea says it has "successfully" carried out a third nuclear test, in defiance of U.N. warnings to stop developing its atomic weapons program.

State media Tuesday said the underground test used a "lighter, miniaturized nuclear bomb" with greater explosive force than previous tests. It said the test was in response to what it called the "reckless hostility" of the United States.

U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon immediately condemned the "deeply destabilizing" move, calling it a "clear and grave violation" of international sanctions.

U.S. President Barack Obama called the test "highly provocative," saying it threatens U.S. security and international peace. He called for "swift and credible" action by the international community.

China, North Korea's main ally, expressed what it called "firm opposition" to the test.

Diplomats say the U.N. Security Council will meet early Tuesday in New York to come up with a response.
