**美国国务卿克里抵达伦敦**

美国国务卿克里抵达伦敦，这是他本月早些时候就任国务卿之后首次正式出访。

星期一，克里将会晤英国首相卡梅伦和外交大臣黑格，随后将继续访问德国、法国、意大利、土耳其、埃及、沙特阿拉伯、阿拉伯联合酋长国和卡塔尔。

美国国务院说，克里在会见外国官员时，叙利亚将是重要议题。克里将这次出访称为“倾听之旅”。在访问期间，克里还计划会晤叙利亚反对派联盟领导人。

预计，克里在访问柏林期间将会晤俄罗斯外交部长拉夫罗夫。华盛顿和俄罗斯在如何应对叙利亚危机的问题上持有不同立场，而且由于美国计划在欧洲建立一个导弹防御系统，美俄关系变得冷淡。

** Secretary of State Kerry Arrives In London**

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has arrived in London, at the start of his first official trip overseas since taking over the country's top diplomatic position earlier this month.

Kerry will meet with British Prime Minister David Cameron and Foreign Secretary William Hague Monday before continuing on to Germany, France, Italy, Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.

The State Department says Syria will be a key topic of discussion when he meets with various international officials in what Kerry described as his "listening tour." He also plans to meet with the leadership of the Syrian opposition coalition during the trip.

While in Berlin, he is expected to meet with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov. Washington and Moscow have divergent stances on how to deal with Syria, and bilateral relations have cooled over U.S. plans to build a missile defense system in Europe.
