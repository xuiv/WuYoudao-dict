**中国大肆抨击华尔街日报发表亲日社论**

中国抨击美国一家主要报纸发表社论，敦促奥巴马政府在日本与中国激烈的领土争端中加强对日本的支持。

《华尔街日报》星期五发表社论说， 如果美国政府更明确地指出日中领土争端的中心岛屿属于日本，中国就更有可能“后退”。

这篇未署名的社论还说，“日本需要美国的支持来对付中国在尖阁列岛，中国称之为钓鱼岛问题上的欺负行为。“

中国国营的新华社星期二发表社论对此作出回应，指责《华尔街日报》充当日本政府在岛屿问题上的“喉舌”。

社论指责《华尔街日报》号称进行平衡的新闻报道，却采取“极端立场”。中国外交部星期一也把矛头指向《华尔街日报》，要求该报“秉持客观、公正立场，多为缓解局势、解决争议发挥建设性作用”。

白宫官员说， 他们在中日有争议的岛屿主权问题上不站在任何一边，但是承认有关岛屿在美日安保条约的范围之内。

China Slams US Paper over Pro-Japan Editorial

China is lashing out at a major U.S. newspaper for publishing an editorial urging Washington to offer stronger support to Japan in its heated territorial dispute with Beijing.

A Friday editorial in The Wall Street Journal said China is likelier to "back down" if the Obama administration is more explicit that the islands at the heart of the dispute belong to Japan.

The piece, which did not contain a byline, also said "Japan needs U.S. support against Chinese bullying" over the islands, known in Japan as Senkaku and in China as Diaoyu.

In response, China's state-run Xinhua news agency on Tuesday ran its own editorial, suggesting the Journal was acting as a "mouthpiece" for the Japanese government on the islands issue.

The Xinhua editorial accused the Journal of taking an "extreme" position, despite what it said was the paper's "reputed balanced news reporting."

China's foreign ministry on Monday also took aim at the U.S. paper, urging it to take an "objective and impartial stance, and play a more constructive role in easing tensions."

White House officials say they have refused to take a position on the islands' sovereignty, but acknowledge they do fall under a mutual U.S. defense treaty with Japan.

**据报朝鲜导弹可能对美国西海岸构成威胁**

一个主要研究机构说，近来朝鲜阅兵展示的弹道导弹可能比以往所判断的更先进，或许足以对美国西海岸构成威胁。

很多西方分析人士曾经认为，根据平壤2012年4月和今年7月阅兵展示的KN-08导弹的照片判断，那只是不能使用的粗糙模型。但美国约翰·霍普金斯大学的美韩研究所说，尽管只是模型，这种导弹看来更先进，已达到足以构成威胁的程度。

美韩研究所的报告说，KN-08导弹模型看上去显示朝鲜组装部件和运用技术的能力已经足以制造理论射程为5千5百公里至1万1千公里的导弹。这使朝鲜得以将其对美国本土进行核打击的威胁付诸实施。

美韩研究所的报告指出，“几乎可以肯定”朝鲜的KN-08导弹目前还不能使用，至少需要再试验一次。报告说，尽管如此，考虑到导弹模型展示的先进程度以及最近卫星照片显示朝鲜主要导弹发射场有所改进，这种试验随时可能进行。

Report: NKorea's ICBM Prototypes Getting 'Scary Good'

A top research group says prototype ballistic missiles seen at recent North Korean military parades may be more advanced than earlier believed, possibly enough to threaten the U.S. west coast.

Many Western analysts dismissed the KN-08 missiles as primitive, non-operational mockups when they appeared in photos of Pyongyang military parades in April 2012 and again in July of this year. But the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University said the missiles, even if fakes, appear to be getting more advanced, and have reached the point of being what it called "scary good."

The institute's report said the missile mockups appear to show North Korea can assemble components and technologies "good enough to produce missiles with theoretical ranges from 5,500 to over 11,000 kilometers." That would easily be far enough for North Korea to make good on its threats of being able to strike the U.S. mainland with a nuclear warhead.

The report cautioned the KN-08s are "almost certainly" non-operational and would need to be tested at least once. It said, though, a test could occur any time, given the advanced state of the mockup hardware and recent satellite photos showing upgrades at North Korea's main missile launch site.
