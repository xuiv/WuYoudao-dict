**朝鲜再次发出战争威胁**

朝鲜敦促外国人离开韩国，躲避可能发生的军事冲突，这是在朝鲜半岛发出的又一次战争威胁。

朝鲜官方的通讯社星期二发表朝鲜亚太和平委员会的声明，敦促外国旅游者和外国企业为自身安全起见，要采取撤离首尔和韩国其他地区的措施。

朝鲜上星期曾向驻首都平壤的外国使馆发出类似的警告。

与此同时，朝鲜员工星期二没有到朝鲜与韩国共建的开城工业园区上班，此前平壤暂停在园区的运作，而这一园区是双方之间最后一个直接的经济往来纽带。

韩国总统朴槿惠说，平壤星期一决定将5万多名员工撤出开城工业园区，这将损害朝鲜在世界上的商业信誉。

开城工业园区的韩国公司每年为朝鲜经济带来大约九千万美元收入。从上星期开始，朝鲜方面拒绝让韩国人进入开城工业园区。

与此同时，日本开始在东京市区及周边地区部署弹道导弹拦截系统，以在朝鲜发动导弹袭击时保护这座城市。

国际社会对朝鲜实行新一轮制裁激怒了平壤，朝鲜半岛近几个星期来紧张局势升级，平壤威胁要袭击韩国、美国以及亚太地区的美国盟友。

** North Korea Issues New Warnings of War**

North Korea has urged foreigners to leave South Korea to avoid a possible military conflict, issuing yet another threat of war on the Korean peninsula.

The North's official news agency issued a statement from the regime's Asia-Pacific Peace Committee Tuesday, urging foreign tourists and enterprises "to take evacuation measures out of Seoul and South Korea for their own safety.''

North Korea issued a similar warning last week to foreign embassies in the capital of Pyongyang.

Meanwhile, North Korean workers failed to show up for work Tuesday at the Kaesong joint industrial zone with South Korea, after Pyongyang suspended operations at the last direct economic link between the two nations.

South Korean President Park Geun-hye says that Pyongyang's decision Monday to withdraw more than 50,000 workers from the facility will hurt the North's credibility in the world as a place to do business.

Tensions on the Korean peninsula have worsened in recent weeks, as North Korea, angered by a new round of international sanctions, has threatened to attack the South, the United States and U.S. allies in the Asia-Pacific region.

**叙利亚拒绝联合国调查化学武器小组**

叙利亚政府拒绝了联合国秘书长潘基文提出的一项有关准许检查员小组调查化学武器被用于叙利亚内战的要求。

叙利亚外交部说，叙利亚政府愿意准许检查员进入阿勒颇附近的汗阿尔阿萨尔村，据称反政府武装上月在那里使用了化学武器。

潘基文星期一说，调查组准备在24小时之内进入叙利亚，并表示将准许调查组审查有关叙利亚各地使用化学武器的报告。

叙利亚外交部拒绝了这一提议，声称这将侵犯叙利亚主权。

叙利亚政府和反对阿萨德总统的反政府武装相互指责对方使用化学武器。

** Syria Rejects UN Chemical Weapons Team**

The Syrian government has rejected a request by United Nations chief Ban Ki-moon to allow a team of inspectors to investigate the use of chemical weapons in the country's civil war.

Syria's foreign ministry says the government is willing to allow the inspectors into the village of Khan al-Assal, near Aleppo, where the rebels were alleged to have used chemical weapons last month.

Mr. Ban said Monday that an investigating team is ready to deploy in the country within 24 hours, suggesting that it be allowed to investigate reports of chemical attacks throughout the country.

The Syrian foreign ministry rejected that proposal saying it would be a violation of Syrian sovereignty.

Both the government and rebels opposed to President Assad have traded accusations about the use of chemical weapons.
