**奥巴马敦促加强导弹防御系统以应对朝鲜威胁**

美国总统奥巴马敦促加强导弹防御系统，以应对来自朝鲜的威胁。朝鲜无视联合国的制裁决议，进行了第三次核试验。

奥巴马星期二发表年度国情咨文演讲时，誓言将针对朝鲜核试验采取“坚决的行动”。


在奥巴马发表演讲的几小时前，联合国安全理事会一致谴责朝鲜进行地下核试验，并说这一举动“严重违反”了先前国际社会针对朝鲜武器项目的制裁规定。

**Obama Calls for Strengthened Missile Defense In Response to N.Korean Threat **

U.S. President Barack Obama is calling for a strengthened missile defense system in order to counter the threat of North Korea, which defied U.N. sanctions by conducting its third nuclear test.

Speaking Tuesday at the annual State of the Union address, President Obama vowed to take "firm action" in response to the test.

Mr. Obama's speech came just hours after the U.N. Security Council unanimously condemned the underground nuclear test, calling it a "grave violation" of previous international sanctions against North Korea's weapons program.

**一名藏人在尼泊尔自焚 伤势严重**

一名流亡藏人星期三在尼泊尔首都自焚，看来这是抗议中国当局的一系列自焚事件中最近发生的一起。

警方说，这名男子在加德满都的博达塔寺附近的一家餐馆把汽油倒在自己身上，然后点火自焚倒地，博达塔寺被视为最神圣的佛地之一。

一些目击者说，在警察和当地人赶紧把这名男子身上的火扑灭之前，他在念诵反对中国的口号。当地一名藏族领袖说，自杀意图是“值得尊重的”。

据路透社播放的自焚的画面显示，受惊的路人看着一队警察抢救街头一名浑身起火的男子。这些画面的真实性不能得到证实。

自2009年以来，大约100名藏人以自焚形式抗议他们声称中国当局对其文化和故乡的压制。中国当局否认这些指责，并说自杀抗议是恐怖主义行为。

在1959年藏人反对中国当局统治的起义失败之后，目前有两万多流亡藏人在尼泊尔居住。尼泊尔禁止流亡藏人举行示威活动，并于近年来对这类集会进行镇压，以免激怒中国。

**Tibetan in Critical Condition after Self-Immolating in Nepal**

A Tibetan exile set himself on fire in Nepal's capital on Wednesday in what appears to be the latest in a series of self-immolation protests against China.

Police say the man is in critical condition after he poured gasoline on himself and set himself on fire at a restaurant before collapsing near Kathmandu's Boudhanath Stupa, considered one of Buddhism's holiest sites.

Some eyewitnesses say he was chanting anti-China slogans before police and other locals rushed in to put out the flames. A local Tibetan community leader says the suicide attempt was "respectable."

Pictures of the self-immolation in Reuters video show shocked bystanders watching as a team of police rush in to help a man covered in a blanket of flames standing in the street. The authenticity of the pictures could not be confirmed.

About 100 Tibetans have self-immolated since 2009 to protest what they say is Chinese repression of their culture and homeland. China denies the charges and says the suicide protests are acts of terrorism.

More than 20,000 Tibetan exiles are living in Nepal, after a failed 1959 uprising against Chinese rule. Nepal has prohibited demonstrations by Tibetan exiles and cracked down on such gatherings in recent years, to avoid angering China.
