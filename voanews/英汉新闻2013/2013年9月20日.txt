Super Typhoon Usagi Heads for Philippines, Taiwan, Southern China

The Philippines, Taiwan and southern China are preparing for the arrival of a rapidly intensifying super typhoon.

Typhoon Usagi is the Pacific's strongest storm on record this year, with wind gusts of up to 240 kilometers per hour.

It is expected to strengthen further as it moves toward the northern Philippines and then Taiwan, before weakening and hitting China's southern coast.

伊朗新当选总统鲁哈尼承诺与世界大国进行有建设性的对话。

鲁哈尼继续与美国的媒体进行接触。他是在为《华盛顿邮报》撰写的意见文章“血仇时代已成过去”中做出以上表述的。他说，世界各国领导人有望通过“将威胁转化为机遇”的方式引领世界。

鲁哈尼的这篇专栏文章是在星期四晚间刊出的。再过几天，他将首次以总统的身份登上世界舞台。鲁哈尼下周将赴纽约参加联合国安理会大会。

Iran's Rouhani Wants 'Constructive Engagement'

Iran's newly elected President Hassan Rouhani has pledged to join in constructive dialogue with world powers.

Continuing his engagement with U.S. media, Mr. Rouhani says in an opinion piece in The Washington Post that "gone is the age of blood feuds." He says world leaders are expected to "lead" by "turning threats into opportunities."

Mr. Rouhani's column was posted late Thursday, just days before he makes his first appearance as president on the world stage at next week's U.N. General Assembly in New York.
NBC News broadcast an interview with the Iranian president earlier this week, and the Iranian head of state has more media exposure coming up in the next few days.

United Nations and Western sanctions have been imposed on Iran for its controversial nuclear program. Some world powers believe Iran has been attempting to develop nuclear weapons, but Tehran insists its uranium enrichment program is peaceful.

In the Post article, Mr. Rouhani says generating nuclear power is "as much about diversifying" Iran's energy resources as it is about the country's "demand for dignity and respect."
