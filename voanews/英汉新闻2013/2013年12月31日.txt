**中国：一产科医生贩卖婴儿可能被判死刑**

中国北方一名医生承认偷走七名新生婴儿，然后把他们卖给人口贩子。这名医生可能被判处死刑。

中国国家媒体说，陕西省富平县一家医院的产科医生张淑霞在法庭上承认贩卖了七名婴儿。

这名55岁的产科医生被控向婴儿的父母谎称婴儿患有严重先天性疾病，说服他们放弃婴儿。

已有六名婴儿获救，但以165美元被贩卖的另一名婴儿死亡。

中国国营的环球时报说，张淑霞向受害家庭道歉，表示自己是受了一名同伙的欺骗才贩卖婴儿，以为这样做是在帮助有需要的家庭。

在中国，贩卖儿童是一个严重问题。分析人士说，严格的“一胎化”政策使贩卖人口团伙有机可乘。

China: Baby-Stealing Obstetrician Faces Death Penalty

A doctor in northern China faces a possible death sentence after confessing to stealing seven newborn babies and selling them to human traffickers.

State media say Zhang Shuxia, who delivered babies at a hospital in Shaanxi province's Fuping county, acknowledged in court to trafficking the seven babies.

The 55-year-old obstetrician was accused of persuading parents to give up their children after falsely claiming they had serious, congenital diseases.

Six of the children have been rescued, but one died after being trafficked for $165.

The state-run Global Times says Zhang apologized to the victims' families, saying she was "deluded by an accomplice into selling babies in the mistaken belief she was helping families in need."

The sale of children is a major problem in China, where analysts say a strict one-child policy has helped create demand exploited by underground trafficking rings.

以色列又释放了26名巴勒斯坦囚犯，他们因对以色列平民发动致命袭击而被监禁。依照以巴双方为重启和谈而签订的一项协议，以色列同意释放巴基斯坦囚犯。

星期二清晨，人们在约旦河西岸和加沙地带欢呼、挥舞旗帜和燃放焰火，对获释囚犯给予英雄式的欢迎。

巴勒斯坦民族权力机构主席阿巴斯和其他官员在拉马拉迎接获释囚犯，拥抱和亲吻他们。阿巴斯誓言将施加压力，让更多囚犯返回家乡。

这是以色列同意释放四批囚犯中的第三批，以色列总共将释放104名巴勒斯坦人。

释放巴勒斯坦囚犯使很多以色列人感到愤怒，其中包括以色列总理内塔尼亚胡内阁的一些成员。他们认为这些前囚犯是恐怖分子。

Israel Frees More Palestinian Prisoners

Israel has freed 26 more Palestinian prisoners who were jailed for deadly attacks on Israeli civilians, in the latest release under an agreement to revive peace talks between the two sides.

Crowds cheering, waving flags and setting off fireworks welcomed the freed prisoners with a hero's welcome early Tuesday in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and other officials greeted a group of them in Ramallah with hugs and kisses, and Mr. Abbas vowed to press for more prisoners to be allowed to go home.

The latest release was the third of four agreed to with Israel under which a total of 104 Palestinians will be freed.

The releases infuriate many Israelis, including some members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Cabinet. They consider the ex-prisoners terrorists.
