**奥巴马将与国会议员商讨预算问题**

美国总统奥巴马星期五将在白宫会见共和党和民主党的国会领导人，商讨如何在最后一刻做出努力，避免在今天限期之后全面削减开支计划自动生效。

美国国会参议院星期四否决了旨在避免开支削减的相互竞争的法案，一旦星期五的最后期限过后，850亿美元的开支自动削减计划看来已经势在必行，因此奥巴马与议员们的这次会晤多半被认为属于象征性质。

奥巴马总统曾经表示，削减联邦各机构开支的影响不会立即被感受到，但将产生他称作的 "逐渐下滑 "的效应。那就是开支削减持续的时间越长，造成的损害就越大。最受到关注的是国防、基础设施经费、公立学校和学前教育等领域。

预计国防部员工将被迫接受无薪休假，同时对大型基础设施项目最终也将停止提供资金。

**Obama to Talk Budget With Lawmakers **

U.S. President Barack Obama is due to meet at the White House Friday with top Republican and Democratic lawmakers to discuss a last-ditch effort to avoid across-the-board budget cuts scheduled to take effect before the day is over.

The meeting is largely viewed as symbolic, after dueling bills to avoid the cuts were defeated in the Senate Thursday, making $85 billion in automatic spending cuts appear inevitable once the Friday deadline passes.

President Obama has said the effects of the cuts on federal agencies - most notably defense, infrastructure spending, public schools and preschool care - will not be felt immediately, but instead will have what he calls a "tumble downward" effect. That means, the longer the cuts remain in place, the worse the damage they will cause.

Defense employees are expected to be forced to take unpaid time off work, while funding for big infrastructure projects will eventually halt.

**在冲绳犯强奸罪的两名美国海军水兵被判监禁**

日本南部冲绳岛的一家法院判处于去年10月强奸和抢劫一名当地女子的两名美国海军水兵入狱服刑。

日本那霸地区法院以轮奸罪和抢劫罪判处24岁上等兵布朗宁10年监禁，以轮奸罪判处他的同伙，现年23岁的下士多齐尔沃克九年监禁。

这两名美国军人于去年10月16号抢劫并强奸那名女子。他们本星期早些时候都已认罪。

这起案件导致对全体驻日美军实行宵禁。尽管实行了宵禁，美国军人的不当行为继续在日本的美军驻地激起反美情绪。美国军人通常是在喝醉后肇事的。

** 2 US Sailors Imprisoned for Okinawa Rape**

A court on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa has sentenced two U.S. sailors to prison for the rape and robbery of a local woman October last year.

The Naha District Court sentenced 24-year-old Seaman Christopher Browning to 10 years on charges of gang rape and robbery, while his accomplice, 23-year-old Petty Officer 3rd Class Skyler Dozierwalker got nine years for gang rape.

The two robbed and assaulted the woman on October 16. Both men pleaded guilty earlier this week.

The case prompted a Japan-wide curfew for U.S. service members. Despite the curfew, misconduct involving American troops - much of it drunken - has continued to fuel anti-American sentiment in places hosting U.S. bases.
