**中国法院维持对刘晓波妻弟刘辉的判决**

一家中国法院维持对被监禁的中国诺贝尔和平奖得主刘晓波的妻弟刘辉的11年监禁判决，而一些人士认为这一判决是出于政治动机。

刘辉的亲属、律师和支持者立即对怀柔法院星期五的裁决表示谴责。怀柔处于北京的东北郊。

今年6月，刘辉被判在一桩房地产交易中以欺诈手段获利大约50万美元的罪名成立。刘辉对此提出抗辩，指出这是当局对他家人从事异议活动的报复。

刘辉的姐姐刘霞是刘晓波的妻子。自刘晓波2010年获得诺贝尔和平奖后，刘霞实际上一直在未被起诉的情况下受到软禁。

刘晓波因倡导在中国实行和平民主改革而获得诺贝尔和平奖。中国处于共产党一党统治的政治体制之下。2009年，刘晓波因“颠覆”罪名被判11年监禁。

China: Court Upholds Jail Sentence of Nobel Laureate's Relative

A Chinese court has upheld what some see as a politically motivated 11-year prison sentence against the brother-in-law of imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo.

Relatives, lawyers and supporters of Liu Hui immediately denounced the Friday decision by the court in Huairou, which is on the northeastern outskirts of Beijing.

Liu was convicted in June of fraudulently taking around $500,000 in a real estate deal. He has rejected the charges, saying they were retribution for his family's activism.

His sister is Liu Xia, the wife of the Nobel laureate. She has been held without charge under effective house arrest since her husband won the peace prize in 2010.

Liu Xiaobo was awarded the peace prize for his activism in support of peaceful democratic change in China, which is under a one-party communist political system. He was sentenced in 2009 to 11 years in prison for "subversion."

Egyptian Police to Use Live Ammunition on Protesters


Egyptian police are threatening to use live ammunition to protect themselves against anti-government protesters who say they will not give up their fight.

The Muslim Brotherhood is defying the interim government and calling for another big protest rally after Friday prayers to demand the reinstatement of ousted President Mohamed Morsi.

Meanwhile, French President Francois Hollande plans to speak by phone separately to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister David Cameron Friday to discuss the events in Egypt.

Egyptian authorities accuse the Brotherhood and Morsi supporters of terrorism and sabotage. The Brotherhood says the country is returning to military tyranny.

On Wednesday, Egyptian police used guns, armored vehicles and bulldozers to destroy two large Cairo protest camps. The official death toll from that violence stands at 638, but the Brotherhood puts it in the thousands.

Journalists and witnesses report seeing makeshift morgues and improvised hospitals with blood-covered floors loaded with bodies.

U.S. President Barack Obama has canceled next month's scheduled military exercises with Egypt, an event Egypt always eagerly anticipates.
