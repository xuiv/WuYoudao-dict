**普京赞扬斯诺登“高尚”**

俄罗斯总统普京说，前美国国家安全局合同工爱德华·斯诺登是“高尚”的，但他和俄罗斯安全部门都没有跟斯诺登联系过。斯诺登将美国机密文件泄露给媒体后在俄罗斯获得庇护。

普京是星期四在莫斯科举行的涉及广泛问题的年度记者会上说这番话的。他还谈到俄罗斯部署导弹，美国收集本国公民电话信息，以及俄罗斯给乌克兰的援助等问题。普京回答了记者提出的问题。

普京说，俄罗斯还没有决定是否在加里宁格勒部署导弹。这种可能性让美国以及俄罗斯的邻国波兰和立陶宛感到关切。

普京在谈到美国国家安全局承认收集本国公民电话信息时说，这种监视对于打击恐怖主义是必要的。不过他提醒说，政府需要限制国家安全部门的“胃口”，防止他们拥有过大的权力。

Putin: U.S. Leaker Snowden is "Noble"


Russian President Vladimir Putin says former U.S. national security contractor Edward Snowden is "noble," but that neither he nor Russian security agencies have had any contact with him. Snowden disclosed classified U.S. documents to media outlets, and was later granted asylum in Russia.

Putin made the comment during a wide-ranging annual question-and-answer session with reporters in Moscow Thursday that also covered missile deployment, U.S. eavesdropping on its own citizens, and Russian aid to Ukraine.

He said Moscow has not made a decision on deploying missiles in Kaliningrad, a prospect that has caused concern in neighboring Poland and Lithuania as well as Washington.

Regarding the U.S. National Security Agency's admission that it collected phone records from U.S. citizens, Mr. Putin said such surveillance is necessary to fight terrorism, although he cautioned that government needs to "limit the appetite" of national security agencies to prevent them from becoming too powerful.

Rodman Back in NKorea, Won't Discuss Politics

Retired U.S. basketball star Dennis Rodman is in North Korea for his third visit in recent months, but says he will not raise political issues with the country's leader, Kim Jong Un.

Rodman's visit comes at another tense moment in Pyongyang, just days after the shocking execution of Kim's uncle, mentor and second in command, who was accused of trying to overthrow the state.

Speaking to Reuters at a Beijing hotel before departing for the North, Rodman said the execution of Jang Song Thaek had nothing to do with his visit, which he said was purely for "fun."

The five-time National Basketball Association champion is expected to help train North Korea's national basketball team during his trip, which is sponsored by the Irish bookmaker Paddy Power.

During past visits, the eccentric Rodman has held extended personal meetings with Mr. Kim, who he has called a "friend for life" and a "good guy." He is thought to be the highest-profile American to have met the North Korean leader.
