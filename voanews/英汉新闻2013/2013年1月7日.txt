** Clinton Returns to Work**
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton returns to work Monday after recovering from a blood clot in her head that forced her to spend three nights in the hospital.

She was released last week, capping a month of health concerns that included a stomach virus and a concussion she suffered after fainting at her home.

The State Department says Clinton will hold closed-door meetings with assistant secretaries Monday, but no public events.

Her schedule later in the week includes a meeting Thursday with visiting Afghan President Hamid Karzai.

While not at her office, Clinton has been talking to staff and some foreign officials by telephone.

**印度轮奸案被告周一出庭受审**

星期一，印度轮奸案6名嫌疑人中的5人在新德里一个快速法庭受审。

印度当局以谋杀、强奸、绑架以及其他罪名起诉参与去年12月16号袭击案的5名男子。有关官员说，如果罪名成立，将要求对被告判处死刑。

第6名嫌疑人未满18岁，因此将由少年法庭另行审判。

印度设立了快速审判法庭，负责审理这起野蛮轮奸案。这是新德里所设立的五个快速审判法庭之一。新德里被一些人称为印度的“强奸之都”。这些法庭将审理性攻击以及针对女性的其他罪案，以绕过繁复的印度法庭系统，在这个系统中，案件经常需要很多年才能结案。

**Gang-Rape Suspects Appear in Indian Court **

Five of the six suspects in the Indian gang-rape case arrived at a fast-track court Monday in New Delhi.

Indian authorities have charged the men with murder, rape, kidnapping and other charges in the December 16 attack. Officials say they will push for the death penalty if the men are convicted.

A sixth suspect is under 18 and will be tried separately in a juvenile court.

India set up the fast-track court to try the men accused of the brutal gang-rape. It is one of five fast-track courts being set up in New Delhi, known by some as the "rape capital" of India. The courts will hear cases of sexual assault and other crimes against women in an effort to bypass India's overwhelmed court system, where cases can often take many years to be resolved.
