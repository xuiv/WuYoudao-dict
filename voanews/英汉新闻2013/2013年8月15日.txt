**埃及又有人上街抗议 焚烧政府建筑**

埃及前总统穆尔西的支持者又举行抗议活动。有人放火焚烧开罗附近的一个政府建筑。

埃及国营电视台和目击者说， 数百名穆斯林兄弟会的支持者星期四袭击了吉萨的政府办公机构，放火点燃大楼入口。另有数百人在亚历山大游行示威，要求让穆尔西复职。

新的抗议活动发生在星期三埃及军队暴力镇压之后。安全部队星期三镇压了聚集在开罗营地的抗议者以及在亚历山大和苏伊士反抗政府的人。

穆斯林兄弟会发送的录像显示，开罗的艾尔伊曼清真寺内停放着数百具裹着布的尸体。埃及卫生部星期四说，冲突至少造成525人死亡，3700人受伤。穆斯林兄弟会则说，有4500人死亡。

埃及政府星期三出兵清理穆尔西支持者的抗议营地之前，连续多天发出警告。

埃及内政部长易卜拉欣为安全部队的行动辩护，声称安全部队对抗议营地使用了最低限度的武力，而且只发射了催泪弹。易卜拉欣指责穆兄会向警察开枪、袭击政府建筑以及焚烧教堂，导致全国各地出现了了他所说极端混乱状态。易卜拉欣说，临时政府是在倾听人民的呼声，努力恢复国家稳定。不过有目击者说，安全部队发射了实弹。


Protesters Attack Government Building in Cairo, New Protests Underway

Supporters of ousted Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi are launching new protests, some setting fire to a government building in Cairo.

Egyptian state TV and witnesses say hundreds of Muslim Brotherhood supporters attacked government offices Thursday in Giza, torching the entrance. Separately, hundreds of marched through Alexandria demanding Mr. Morsi's return.

The renewed protests and violence follow Wednesday's violent crackdown by Egypt's military on Morsi supporters gathered in protest camps around Cairo and fighting in Alexandria and Suez.

Video being distributed by the Muslim Brotherhood showed hundreds of bodies wrapped in shrouds at Cairo's El Iman mosque. Egypt's health ministry says Wednesday's violence killed at least 525 people and wounded more than 3,700. The Muslim Brotherhood has put the death toll at more than 4,500.

Authorities had warned for days they would move against the protest camps.

The interior minister in the military-backed interim government, Mohamed Ibrahim, defended the actions of security forces, insisting they used minimum force against the camps and only fired tear gas.

Ibrahim blamed the Brotherhood for creating what he called a state of mayhem across the country by shooting at police, attacking government buildings and burning churches. But witnesses reported security forces firing live ammunition.

**马里确认凯塔当选新总统 政变上尉变将军**


马里政府确认易卜拉欣•凯塔在星期日的总统决选中获得压倒性胜利。

官方星期四公布的数据显示，曾出任过总理的凯塔赢得了77.6%的选票。他的对手、前财政部长苏迈拉•西塞只获得了略微超过22%的选票。西塞已经承认败选。

在确认凯塔胜选之前，2012年3月领导了一场政变的陆军上尉阿马杜•萨诺戈被越级擢升。

军方官员星期三说，临时政府已经把萨诺戈提拔为上将。这跨越了好几级军衔。

人权组织批评提升萨诺戈。人权观察说，不应该“奖励”萨诺戈，而是应该调查他参与了与政变有关的侵权行为的指称。

路透社说，外交人士说，这项提拔的目的是鼓动萨诺戈退役。

Mali Confirms Huge Election Win for New President

Mali's government has confirmed Ibrahim Boubacar Keita won a landslide victory in Sunday's presidential election runoff.

The government released figures on Thursday showing the former prime minister captured 77.6 percent of the vote.

His rival, former finance minister Soumaila Cisse, won just over 22 percent. Cisse had already conceded defeat.

Confirmation of Mr. Keita's victory followed the announcement that the army captain who led a coup in March 2012 has received a huge promotion.

On Wednesday, military officials said the interim government had promoted Amadou Sanogo to general, a promotion that skips over several military ranks.

Rights groups have criticized the decision. Human Rights Watch says Sanogo, instead of being "rewarded," should be investigated for his alleged involvement in serious abuses linked to the coup.
