**人权组织促克里向中国提人权问题**

一些人权团体敦促美国国务卿克里即将在访问中国时提出异议人士所受到的对待以及其它人权问题。预计克里访问中国的主要议题将围绕朝鲜。

国际特赦组织和记者无国界等人权组织本星期致函克里国务卿，他们担心美国在寻求中国经济发展机会和谋求中国支持解决朝鲜和其它国际问题时，人权问题会被忽视。

人权组织的信函说，中国尽管在改善人权方面拒绝向外界压力屈服，但是北京当局看来会对这种压力有所反应。

信函指责中国政府加大迫害国内的批评人士，在西藏和新疆实行打压政策，并对公民社会、言论自由以及因特网的使用加以限制。

人权组织的信函还说，克里对中国的访问是向中国发出信息的一个重要时刻，那就是，美中关系的进展在相当程度上要取决于中国实施其国内政策和外交政策时是否符合普世人权准则。

**Rights Groups Urge Kerry to Address China's Human Rights**

Human rights groups are urging U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry to raise the treatment of dissidents and other rights concerns during his upcoming visit to China, expected to be dominated by talks on North Korea.

Several groups, including Amnesty International and Reporters Without Borders, said in a letter to Kerry this week that they fear human rights concerns have been sacrificed, as Washington pursues economic opportunities in China and seeks Beijing's support on North Korea other international concerns.

The letter said that as much as China resists outside pressure to improve its rights record, Beijing does appear to respond to such pressure.

It accused the Chinese government of increasing the persecution of domestic critics, pursuing abusive policies in Tibet and Xinjiang and imposing restrictions on civil society, freedom of expression and the Internet.

The letter said Kerry's visit was a crucial moment to signal to China that the quality of U.S.-China relations will depend in part on whether it lives by universally accepted human rights norms in its domestic and foreign policies。

**克里抵达首尔 期间人们担心朝鲜导弹试射*

美国国务卿克里星期五抵达首尔，目前人们担心朝鲜将很快再次进行挑衅性导弹试射。

克里在访问期间将与包括朴槿惠总统在内的韩国官员举行会谈。此外，克里还将会见驻韩美军指挥官。

在克里访问韩国之际，有关朝鲜试射一枚中程导弹以显示有能力打击该地区美国目标的猜测增多。

一名美国官员在首尔说，目前没有迹象显示朝鲜将很快发射舞水端导弹，据信这种导弹的射程为3500公里，可对日本和关岛的美军基地构成威胁。

一些人认为，平壤会选在克里抵达韩国之际进行这次世人瞩目的导弹试射。首尔曾经表示，预计平壤将在下星期一庆祝朝鲜建国领导人金日成诞辰之前试射导弹。

与此同时，美国官员淡化处理星期四透露的一份情报报告，该报告称平壤已经成功研制出小型核弹头。

星期四，一名美国国会议员在一次例行预算听证会上披露了这份分析报告的内容，分析报告说华盛顿的防务官员在某种程度上相信朝鲜拥有可以通过弹道导弹发射的核武器。

** Amid Worries Over NKorean Missile Test, Kerry Arrives in Seoul**

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry arrived Friday in Seoul, amid concern North Korea will soon conduct another provocative missile test.

Kerry will hold talks with South Korean officials, including President Park Geun-hye during his visit. He will also meet with U.S. military commanders based in the country.

His visit comes as speculation increased that North Korea is preparing to test a mid-range missile to demonstrate its ability to hit U.S. targets in the region.

A U.S. official in Seoul said there is no sign of an imminent launch of the North's Musudan missile, which is believed to have a range of 3,500 kilometers and could threaten U.S. bases in Japan or Guam.

Some believe Pyongyang will coordinate the headline-grabbing missile test with Kerry's arrival. Seoul has said it expects the test to occur in the run-up to Monday's birthday celebration of North Korean founding leader Kim Il Sung.

Meanwhile, U.S. officials are downplaying a U.S. intelligence report disclosed Thursday that suggested Pyongyang has succeeded miniaturizing a nuclear weapon.

The analysis, disclosed by a congressman Thursday during a routine budget hearing, said Washington defense officials are moderately confident the North has nuclear weapons capable of delivery by ballistic missiles.
