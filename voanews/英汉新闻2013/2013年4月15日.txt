**朝鲜庆祝金日成诞辰**

朝鲜庆祝建国领袖金日成诞辰101周年。

金日成诞辰是朝鲜最重要的日子，但星期一没有举行军队检阅，也没有计划举行任何大规模庆祝活动的迹象。

韩国处于戒备状态，准备应对朝鲜方面可能为纪念金日成诞辰而做出的挑衅，但朝鲜没有像广泛预料的那样试射弹道导弹，甚至没有试射短程火箭。

上星期，对朝鲜可能试射导弹的担忧情绪蔓延，当时韩国当局说，观察到朝鲜将移动式导弹发射架移至东海岸。

金日成于1994年去世。

**North Korea Marks Birth of Founder**

North Koreans are celebrating the 101st anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, the founder of North Korea..

On the most important holiday on the North Korean calendar, there was no military parade Monday, and no signs that any large-scale festivities were planned.

Although South Korea was on alert for any provocation to mark the day, the North did not test a ballistic missile or even a short-range rocket, as had been widely anticipated.

Concern about the possibility of such tests spread last week when South Korean authorities said they had seen North Korea moving mobile missile launchers on its east coast.

Kim Il Sung died in 1994.

**克里与日本首相商讨朝鲜问题**

美国国务卿克里在东京会晤了日本首相安倍晋三，这是克里出访亚洲三国的最后一天，访问期间的首要议题是朝鲜问题。

克里星期一说，他和安倍晋三首相在网络安全、气候改变以及团结一致应对朝鲜半岛的平壤威胁等问题上取得了重要进展。

克里在会晤安倍晋三之前，于东京理工学院对学生们说，平壤承担着责任，要在履行已经做出的承诺方面采取有意义的步骤。克里还表示，朝鲜必须遵守法律和国际行为准则。

克里星期天会晤日本外相岸田文雄之后在记者会上说，如果朝鲜迈出放弃核武器的步伐，美国愿意与之谈判，寻找和平化解朝鲜半岛紧张局势的途径。

克里说，平壤有一条“明确的道路可供选择”，而且美国将愿意与之展开谈判。但在另一次讲话中，克里表示，他必须和华盛顿的同僚们商议，以了解他们认为平壤必须采取什么具体行动。

此外，克里重申美国致力于保卫日本的承诺。日本是美国的重要盟国。朝鲜不断威胁要攻击美国及其亚洲盟友，包括日本和韩国。

**Kerry Discusses North Korea with Japan Prime Minister**

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has met in Tokyo with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on the last day of a three-nation Asian tour focusing on North Korea.

Kerry said Monday that the two had made important advances in cyber-security, climate change and on solidarity with respect to the North Korean threat on the Korean peninsula.

The top U.S. diplomat met with the Japanese leader after telling students at the Tokyo Institute of Technology that the burden is on Pyongyang to take meaningful steps to honor commitments it has already made. He added that the North must observe laws and the norms of international behavior.

After a meeting Sunday with Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida, Kerry told a news conference that Washington is willing to negotiate with North Korea for a peaceful resolution of tensions on the Korean peninsula if Pyongyang takes steps toward abandoning nuclear weapons.

Kerry said Pyongyang has a "clear course of action available to it" and will find a "ready partner" for negotiations in the United States. But, in separate remarks, Kerry said he will have to consult with colleagues in Washington about what specific actions they believe Pyongyang must take.

Kerry also reiterated Washington's commitment to the defense of Japan, a key U.S. ally. North Korea has made repeated threats to attack the United States and its regional allies, including Japan and South Korea.
