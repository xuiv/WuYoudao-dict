抗议者还冲入首都巴西利亚的外交部，向外交部大楼内投掷燃烧物和爆竹，随后被警察驱散。

**Brazil President Calls Emergency Cabinet Meeting on Protests**

Brazil's president has called for an emergency Cabinet meeting to discuss an intensifying protest movement that has not slowed down despite government concessions.

At least one million protesters rallied in dozens of cities across Brazil Thursday, including at least 300,000 in Rio de Janeiro where police fired tear gas to contain the crowds.

Protesters also stormed the foreign ministry in the capital, Brasilia, throwing burning objects and firecrackers into the building before being repelled by police.

President Dilma Rousseff will meet with several government ministers early Friday to discuss how to respond to the protests, the country's biggest in two decades. She has already called off a trip to Japan planned for next week.

This week's protests were originally triggered by an increase in bus and subway fares, but protesters have since focused on what they say is the government's neglect of public services, high taxes, and rampant corruption.

今年四月，印度发生历史上最严重的违章建筑楼房倒塌事件，74人丧生。

**10 Killed in Mumbai Building Collapse **

An apartment building has collapsed in the outskirts of India's financial capital, killing 10 people, including five children, and injuring nine other people.

Officials say the three-story building collapsed early Friday in the Thane area on the outskirts of Mumbai while many of its residents were asleep.

Police say emergency workers have rescued 20 people from the rubble and are continuing efforts to find more survivors. The cause of the collapse is under investigation.

Building collapses are common in India because builders often use substandard materials, and multi-story structures are often built without adequate supervision.

Less than two weeks ago, 10 people were killed when another building collapsed in Mumbai.

In April, 74 people died in one of the worst building disasters in India's history when a building being illegally constructed gave in.
