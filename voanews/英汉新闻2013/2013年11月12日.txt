**国际社会加紧救援菲律宾台风灾区**

美国国防部派遣一艘航空母舰，加紧援助遭到台风侵袭的菲律宾中部地区，当地可能有多达一万人死于风灾，并有很多人无家可归。

星期二，救灾人员仍无法进入一些灾区。四天前，台风“海燕”横扫菲律宾中部地区。“海燕”是自有记录以来最猛烈的台风，掀起的海浪如同海啸。

联合国估计无家可归的灾民多达66万。很多人得不到食物、水和药品。有报道说，灾情最重的独鲁万市出现广泛的抢劫行为。

国际社会开始加紧救援行动。美国星期一宣布，将提供2千万美元人道援助。美国还派出“乔治·华盛顿号”航空母舰参与救灾，这艘航母载有5千名军人和80多架飞机。

International Relief Efforts Picking up in Typhoon-Hit Philippines

The Pentagon is sending an aircraft carrier as part of U.S. efforts to accelerate aid to the typhoon-ravaged central Philippines, where 10,000 people are feared dead and many more displaced.

Some of the affected areas had still not been reached Tuesday, four days after Typhoon Haiyan plowed through the remote island region with historically powerful winds and tsunami-like waves.

The U.N. estimates 660,000 people were displaced by the storm. Many have no access to food, water or medicine and there have been reports of widespread looting in Tacloban, the worst-hit city.

International relief efforts have begun to pick up. The U.S. on Monday announced it is providing $20 million in humanitarian aid. It is also sending the USS George Washington, an aircraft carrier with 5,000 sailors and more than 80 aircraft on board.

**伊朗和世界强国仍对达成核协议保持乐观，但互相指责**

伊朗和争取限制伊朗铀浓缩活动的世界六强国的外交官们相互指责对方造成最近一次会谈无果而终，但他们表示将继续致力于达成一项协议，并对此持乐观态度。

伊朗外交部长扎里夫星期一晚间说，双方在会谈中取得了“很大进展”。在日内瓦举行的本次会谈于上周末结束。但扎里夫说，由于所谓的“五常加一”六国之间存在分歧，导致会谈未能达成协议。五常加一包括美国、英国、法国、中国、俄罗斯和德国。

美国国务卿克里和英国外交大臣黑格说，五常加一对协议的立场保持一致。克里说，不肯接受有关协议的是伊朗。他还表示，希望双方在数月内达成一致立场。

谈判将于下星期继续进行。

Iran, World Powers Optimistic but Trading Blame Over Nuclear Talks

Diplomats from Iran and a group of world powers seeking to limit its uranium enrichment say they remain committed and optimistic about reaching a deal, despite trading blame for failing to agree at their latest meeting.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said late Monday the two sides made "considerable progress" during days of talks that ended last weekend in Geneva. But he blamed the lack of a deal on divisions among the so-called P5+1 group that includes the United States, Britain, France, China, Russia and Germany.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and British Foreign Secretary William Hague each said their group was united in their proposal. Kerry said it was Iran that could not accept the deal, and said he hoped the two sides would reach an agreement within months.

The negotiations resume next week.
