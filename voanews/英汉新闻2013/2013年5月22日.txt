**金正恩派特使去中国**

朝鲜领导人金正恩派遣一名高层军方官员作为特使前往中国，目前这两个传统盟友之间的关系处于紧张状态。
朝鲜官方的朝中社说，朝鲜人民军总政治局局长崔龙海星期三率领一个政府代表团离开平壤前往中国。朝中社的报道没有透露有关这次访问目的的任何细节。
中国外交部发言人洪磊说， 北京将跟崔龙海讨论朝鲜半岛的局势以及其他“共同关注”的问题。
自金正恩在他父亲2011年去世后接掌领导权以来，据信这是朝鲜派往北京的最高级别代表团之一。
中国长期以来一直是朝鲜的主要盟友和经济支柱。但有迹象显示，北京新领导层对朝鲜渐渐失去耐心。

**North Korea's Kim Sends Envoy to China**
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has sent a senior military official as a special envoy to China, at a time of strained relations between the two traditional allies.
The official Korean Central News Agency said Choe Ryong Hae, the director of the General Political Bureau of the North Korean army, left Pyongyang for China Wednesday along with a government delegation. No details about the purpose of the trip were given.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hong Lei said Beijing plans to discuss the situation on the Korean peninsula and "issues of common concern" with Choe.
It is believed to be one of the highest-level delegations North Korea has sent to Beijing since Mr. Kim took over leadership of the country following the death of his father in late 2011.
China has long been North Korea's main ally and primary economic lifeline. But there are signs that the new leadership in Beijing is growing impatient with the North.
The brief KCNA report detailing Choe's visit also indicated that North Korea has again reshuffled the top ranks of its military. The report named Kim Kyok Sik, a hawkish general, as the North's new military chief.

这场龙卷风摧毁了美国中部这座城镇的大部分地区，气象机构官员说，龙卷风的风速至少达到每小时322公里。
穆尔镇的消防队长说，紧急救援人员不会停止搜救幸存者的行动，计划在每座建筑的废墟中至少搜寻3遍。

**US Homeland Security Secretary to Survey Tornado Response**
U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano travels to Oklahoma on Wednesday to assess recovery efforts in the city of Moore, where a devastating tornado killed at least 24 people and injured 240 others.
Napolitano's department includes the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which has teams helping with search and recovery operations, damage assessments and providing federal aid to people affected by Monday's tornado.
The storm destroyed large parts of the central U.S. city with what weather officials say were winds of at least 322 kilometers per hour.
The town's fire chief says emergency workers will not stop searching for survivors and plan to go through the rubble of each building at least three times.
President Barack Obama has declared a major disaster in Oklahoma. He says the people of Moore are not standing alone, as they recover and rebuild.
