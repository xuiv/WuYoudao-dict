**针对美韩军演 朝鲜军队进入戒备状态**

朝鲜当局下令军队进入戒备状态，并警告美韩两国在朝鲜本地附近举行的军事演习可能带来“灾难性后果”。

朝鲜军队发言人星期二对本国国家媒体说，全军奉命随时准备展开行动。

韩国国防部发言人金珉奭证实，朝鲜军队已经进入高度戒备状态。

在朝鲜发出这一威胁之际，美国一些海军舰只驶向韩国釜山港。有关官员说，美国军舰是在进行搜索及救援例行训练。

看来平壤对美国核动力航空母舰“乔治•华盛顿号”参加军演感到特别不安。

朝中社刊登的一篇文章说，“乔治•华盛顿号”载有至少1百枚核弹。

这篇文章警告说，美国军队越接近朝鲜，就越无法预测这种行动会带来何种灾难。

平壤经常扬言要针对美韩军演采取军事行动，但极少付诸实施。

NKorea Puts Troops on Alert over US-Led Military Drill

North Korea has placed its military on alert and warned of "disastrous consequences" in response to a United States-led military drill near the Korean peninsula.

A North Korean military spokesman Tuesday told state media all troops have been ordered to "keep themselves ready to promptly launch operations at any time."

South Korean Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok confirmed North Korea's military has been placed on high alert.

The threat comes as the U.S. moved a group of ships to the South Korean port of Busan for what officials describe as a routine search and rescue drill.

Pyongyang seems to be particularly upset about the participation of the USS George Washington, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier.

The article in the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) claimed the ship was carrying "at least 100 nuclear bombs aboard."

It warned the closer that U.S. forces get to North Korea, "the more unpredictable disasters their actions will cause."

Pyongyang often threatens military action in response to the U.S.-South Korean drills, but rarely follows through.

Typhoon Fitow Kills Six in Eastern China

Chinese state media say at least six people were killed and several others remain missing after Typhoon Fitow slammed into a southeastern region.

The powerful storm made landfall in Fujian Province Monday, packing winds of up to 150 kilometers per hour. Much of the surrounding area still was submerged in floodwaters Tuesday.

The storm has since weakened, but torrential rains continued in nearby Zhejiang province, prompting the government's highest emergency flood response.

The Xinhua news agency says over 4,000 homes collapsed in the storm. Many areas were also without power, as well as rail and air transportation.

Fitow is named after a flower from Micronesia. The typhoon is the 23rd to hit China this year.
