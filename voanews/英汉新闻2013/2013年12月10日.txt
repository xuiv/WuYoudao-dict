**六万余人云集约翰内斯堡向曼德拉致敬**

六万多人聚集在南非约翰内斯堡，参加追悼仪式，缅怀已故南非总统纳尔逊·曼德拉。

虽然阴雨绵绵，但人群的激情丝毫不减。参加追悼仪式的人群载歌载舞，向曼德拉表达敬意。发言者纷纷盛赞曼德拉为结束南非种族隔离制度与治疗种族对立伤口所做的贡献。

联合国秘书长潘基文说，曼德拉的逝世是全世界的巨大损失。

他说：“南非失去了一位英雄。你们失去了一位父亲。全世界失去了一位亲爱的朋友和导师。纳尔逊·曼德拉不仅仅是我们这一时代的最伟大领袖之一，他还是我们最伟大的导师之一。”

美国总统奥巴马说，曼德拉和南非向世人显示，争取自由和人权的斗争如何能够赢得胜利。

他说：“纳尔逊·曼德拉提醒我们，在事情做成之前，看起来似乎总是不可能做成的。南非向我们显示，那就是事实。南非向我们显示，我们能够带来变革。我们能够选择一个不是由我们的不同而是由我们的共同希望来界定的世界。我们可以选择一个不是由冲突而是由和平、正义和机会来界定的世界。”

其他发言者包括古巴总统劳尔·卡斯特罗和巴西总统迪尔玛·罗塞夫。

曼德拉因为领导反对占少数的白人统治的斗争而坐牢27年，后来在1994年成为南非首任黑人总统。

追悼仪式在约翰内斯堡的主要体育场举行，这里曾举办过2010年的世界杯决赛。曼德拉最后一次公开露面也是在这座体育场。他参加了世界杯的闭幕式。那是非洲首次主办世界杯足球赛。

除了奥巴马总统之外，美国代表团还包括第一夫人米歇尔·奥巴马和三位前总统：小布什、克林顿与卡特。

从星期三到星期五，曼德拉的遗体将安放在比勒陀利亚的联盟大厦。这里是南非政府所在地。

悼念仪式和相关活动将持续到12月15日，曼德拉在这一天将被安葬在他童年的故居库努村。

Over 60,000 Pay Tribute to Mandela in Johannesburg

More than 60,000 people gathered in Johannesburg Tuesday for a memorial service to honor late South African President Nelson Mandela.

A steady rain did not stop mourners from singing and dancing in tribute to Mr. Mandela, as speakers praised his role in ending apartheid and healing South Africa's racial divisions.

U.N. Secretary-General said Mr. Mandela's passing is an enormous loss.

"South Africa has lost a hero. You have lost a father. The world has lost a beloved friend and mentor. Nelson Mandela was more than one of the greatest leaders of our time, he was one of our greatest teachers."

U.S. President Barack Obama said Mr. Mandela, and South Africa, showed how fights for freedom and human rights can be won.

"Nelson Mandela reminds us that it always seems impossible until it is done. South Africa shows that is true. South Africa shows we can change. That we can choose a world defined not by our differences, but by our common hopes. We can choose a world defined not by conflict, but by peace and justice and opportunity."

Other speakers included Cuban President Raul Castro and Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff.

Mr. Mandela became South Africa's first black president in 1994, after being imprisoned for 27 years for his role in the struggle against white minority rule.

The service was held in Johannesburg's main stadium used for the 2010 World Cup football (soccer) finals.

The venue is also the place where Mr. Mandela made his last public appearance at the closing ceremony of the first-ever World Cup in Africa.

Along with President Obama, the U.S. delegation included first lady Michelle Obama and former Presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter.

Mr. Mandela's remains will lie in state at the Union Buildings in Pretoria -- the official seat of the South African government -- on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.

The memorials and events will culminate in Mr. Mandela's burial on December 15 in his boyhood home village of Qunu.

Ukraine President Meets with Predecessors, Western Envoys

Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych met with three former Ukrainian presidents and the EU foreign policy chief in an effort to diffuse tensions over his refusal to sign a long-anticipated European Union trade deal in favor of closer ties to Russia.

Mr. Yanukovych met Tuesday with his predecessors Viktor Yushchenko, Leonid Kuchma, and Leonid Kravchuk as part of national roundtable discussions.

He is also set to meet with EU official Catherine Ashton while she is in Ukraine for a two-day visit.

Meanwhile U.S. assistant secretary of state Victoria Nuland met with three top opposition leaders and was scheduled to meet with Mr. Yanukovych later Tuesday. Nuland says the U.S. is cooperating closely with the European Union to resolve the crisis.
