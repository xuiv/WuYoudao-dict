**穆尔西的支持者坚守抗议营地**

尽管埃及政府数天来警告说将很快采取清场行动，被罢免的前埃及总统穆尔西的支持者继续大胆地坚守在开罗的抗议营地。

星期一晚上，大批支持穆尔西的抗议者挥舞旗帜，并高举写有穆尔西名字的标语牌，要求恢复他的总统职位。

美国加州大学伯克利分校的人类学副教授马赫穆德对美国之音说，由于清场带来的流血将导致非常严重的政治后果，埃及临时政府还没有采取行动。

但马赫穆德说，穆尔西的穆斯林兄弟会面临着比争取他官复原职更大的挑战，此前穆兄会的主要成员被逮捕，而且当局冻结了该组织用于政治活动及社区服务的资产。

Morsi Supporters Remain in Protest Camps

Supporters of ousted Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi are defiantly remaining at their protest camps in Cairo, despite days of warnings that the government would soon move on the sites.

Large crowds of pro-Morsi protesters were at the camps Monday night, chanting, waving flags and holding up signs of the man they say should be reinstated as president.

Saba Mahmood, associate professor of anthropology at the University of California at Berkeley, told VOA ((English to Africa)) the interim government has not broken up the camps because the resulting bloodshed would be a "very serious political cost."

But she says Mr. Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood is facing bigger stakes than getting him back in office, after the arrests of other key members of the group and moves to freeze assets it uses for political work and providing services to the community.


**中国报告第44起H7N9禽流感死亡病例**

中国国家媒体说，又有一人死于一种新型禽流感。这种禽流感已经导致44人死亡。

中国官方的新华社说，河北省一名61岁男子星期一死于多器官功能衰竭。报道说，这名男子7月20日的H7N9病毒化验结果呈阳性。
自中国3月首次发现禽流感疫情以来，已经报告了134起感染病例，其中包括广东省的一起。新华社的报道中提到了这起病例。

北京已经停止实施对H7N9禽流感疫情的紧急应对方案，疫情没有迅速蔓延，而且主要限于中国东部地区。在中国大陆以外地区，只有台湾报告了一起病例。

到目前为止，这种新型禽流感比已经证实的H5N1禽流感病例更为致命。十年来，H5N1禽流感导致360多人死亡。但人们担心新型禽流感可能发生变异，而且更容易蔓延。

China Reports 44th Death from H7N9 Bird Flu

Chinese state media say another person has died from a new strain of the bird flu that has now claimed the lives of 44 people.

The official Xinhua news agency says a 61-year-old man from northern China's Hebei Province died Monday of multiple organ failure. It says he tested positive for the H7N9 virus on July 20.

China has reported 134 infections of the virus since it first appeared in March. That includes a case in southern Guangdong Province, which was mentioned in the Xinhua report.

Beijing has called off its emergency response to H7N9, which has not spread rapidly and has been mostly contained to eastern China. Only one case has been reported outside the mainland, in Taiwan.

The new strain of avian influenza has so far been more lethal in confirmed cases than another strain, the H5N1 virus, which has killed more than 360 people in the past decade. But there is concern the new virus could mutate and be able to spread more easily.
