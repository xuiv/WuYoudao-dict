**人权观察敦促叙利亚军队停止导弹袭击**

人权观察组织敦促叙利亚军队停止任意向居民区发射弹道导弹。

总部设在美国的人权观察星期一说，该组织今年对9次疑似弹道导弹袭击进行了调查，这些袭击造成215名平民死亡，主要发生在阿勒颇市及周边地区。

阿勒颇是叙利亚最大城市，同时也是阿萨德总统的政府军与致力于推翻阿萨德的反政府组织进行内战的主要前沿地区之一。

人权观察说，在上述导弹袭击中，有7次并未针对显著的军事目标，对平民造成了重大损失，看来却没有取得军事上的进展。

人权观察指责使用弹道导弹的做法，表示即使有战斗人员在该地区活动，弹道导弹也不可能准确地击中他们，其结果是对平民造成极大破坏。

**HRW Urges Syria to Curb Missile Attacks**

Human Rights Watch is calling on Syrian forces to end what it calls the indiscriminate use of ballistic missiles in populated areas.

The U.S.-based group said Monday it has investigated nine apparent ballistic missile attacks this year that killed 215 civilians, mainly in the city of Aleppo and its surrounding province.

Aleppo is Syria's largest city, and has been among the key fronts in the civil war between President Bashar al-Assad and rebels trying to push him from power.

Human Rights Watch said there were no apparent military targets near where seven of the attacks took place, causing significant civilian damage with no apparent military advantage.

It criticized the use of ballistic weapons, saying even if there are fighters in a given area, the weapons cannot accurately target them. The result, the group says, has been "devastating" to civilians.
