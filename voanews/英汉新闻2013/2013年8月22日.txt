Bo Xilai Trial Goes on Trial in China

China's most closely watched trial in decades began Thursday, as deposed politician Bo Xilai appeared in court to face charges of corruption, bribery and abuse of power.

The official Xinhua news agency says Bo told the court that he hopes the trial can be held "in a reasonable and fair manner and follow the legal proceedings of our country."

Government-run broadcaster CCTV reported the trial in Jinan, the capital of eastern Shandong Province, will last two days and that a verdict is expected in early September.

Outside the court, police blocked off streets with large plastic barriers. Nearby, a few Bo supporters who held a protest were quickly hustled away by police for a second straight day.

The trial is not televised and foreign media were kept out of the hearing.

Egypt's Mubarak Released From Prison to House Arrest

Former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak has been released from prison, adding another potentially complicating element to the country's ongoing turmoil.

A helicopter picked up Mr. Mubarak at Cairo's Tora prison on Thursday and flew him to a military hospital near the capital, where he will be placed under house arrest.

Egyptian judicial authorities ordered the release of the ailing 85-year-old from prison this week, saying he could no longer be held in custody during his retrial on corruption and murder charges.

Mr. Mubarak has faced murder and corruption charges linked to his 30 years in power and the 2011 popular uprising that ended his rule.
