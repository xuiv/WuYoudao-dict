**安倍晋三访美与奥巴马重点讨论地区安全及经济**

日本首相安倍晋三2月22日(星期五)在华盛顿会晤美国总统奥巴马时预计将讨论地区安全与经济问题。

这是两位领导人第一次会晤。白宫官员说，会晤将在白宫椭圆形办公室开始，预计日本与中国的领土纠纷和朝鲜最新核试验问题将是首要议题。

接下来是午餐会议，会谈重点预计是两国之间的经济关系。美国是世界第一大经济体，日本是世界第三经济体。预计双方将讨论日本加入美国牵头的自由贸易集团“跨太平洋合作伙伴关系”的问题。

安倍星期四抵达华盛顿。他去年12月复出，再次担任首相。在日本因领土争议而感觉到来自中国的威胁之际，他的竞选纲领包括加强日美关系。

安倍首相星期五早晨在阿灵顿国家公墓出席了敬献花圈仪式。这里安息着数以千计的美国老兵。

在访问之前，安倍晋三接受《华盛顿邮报》采访时的评论引起了争议。他指责中国利用国立教育系统鼓励反日情绪。

安倍首相说，中国有着“根深蒂固的”与日本和其它邻国冲突的需要。他说，北京利用这些纠纷来维持国内强有力的民意支持。他警告说，这些纠纷不会很快解决。

中国反驳了安倍的评论。

**Obama-Abe Meeting to Focus on Security, Economic Issues**

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is expected to discuss regional security and economic issues when he meets Friday with U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington.

White House officials say the first meeting between the two leaders will begin in the Oval Office, where Japan's tension with China over a territorial dispute and North Korea's latest nuclear test are expected to top the agenda.

A lunch meeting is then expected to focus on economic ties between the world's first and third biggest economies. Japan's participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership - a U.S.-led free-trade group - is expected to be discussed.

Mr. Abe, who arrived in Washington Thursday, began his second turn as prime minister in December. He campaigned in part on a pledge of closer relations with the United States amid perceived threats from China's territorial claims.

The Japanese prime minister on Friday morning was attending a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, the final resting place for thousands of veterans.

Ahead of his visit, Mr. Abe sparked controversy in an interview with The Washington Post, where he accused China of using its state-run school system to encourage anti-Japan sentiment.

The prime minister said China has a "deeply ingrained" need for conflict with Japan and its other neighbors. He says Beijing uses the disputes to maintain strong domestic support, warning they will not be resolved soon.

China rejected the comments.


**印度爆炸丧生人数升至16人**

印度内政部长辛德说，印度政府将“竭尽全力”抓拿制造海德拉巴爆炸的凶手。这次爆炸导致16人死亡，一百多人受伤。

辛德星期五对议会说，这次爆炸的凶手和策划者将受到法律制裁。

星期五早些时候，辛德对记者说，三天来向全国发出了可能在印度某个地方发生爆炸的一般性的警报，但是当局没有得到关于可能发生爆炸的地点的情报。

印度警方说，他们在一年前就接到可能在海德拉巴发生爆炸的警告。

警方星期五说，隶属印度圣战者组织的两名激进分子去年在审讯中交待，他们到海德拉巴的迪尔萨克区进行了踩点。踩点的地方就是星期四当地时间傍晚数分钟内相继发生爆炸的地点。有关官员说，炸弹放在两辆相隔大约150米的自行车上。

目前没有人宣称对爆炸事件负责。

**India Blast Death Toll Climbs to 16 **


India's home minister says the government will "make all efforts" to apprehend those responsible for the blasts in Hyderabad that killed 16 people and wounded more than 100.

Sushil Kumar Shinde told parliament Friday "the perpetrators and masterminds" behind the explosions will be "punished as per the law."

Earlier Friday, Shinde told reporters there had been a general alert for the entire country for the past three days about the possibility of an attack somewhere in India. But he said there was no intelligence about a specific place.

Indian police say they were warned a year ago about a possible attack in Hyderabad.

Police officials said Friday two suspected militants belonging to the Indian Mujahideen revealed during an interrogation last year that they had done a reconnaissance of the Dil Sukh district of Hyderabad, the same area where the blasts occurred minutes apart Thursday evening. Officials say the bombs were attached to two bicycles about 150 meters apart.

There has been no claim of responsibility.
