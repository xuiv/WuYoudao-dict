**教宗方济各抵巴西受到热烈欢迎**

教宗方济各星期一抵达巴西，受到数万信众的欢呼致意。在教宗车队开进里约热内卢市中心的沿途，人们蜂拥而至。教宗开始对巴西进行为期一周的访问。

录像画面显示，安全官员在几处地点奋力将兴高采烈的民众往后推。教宗则摇下车窗，触摸那些把手伸进车窗的人们。一名妇女递给76岁的教宗一名婴儿，教宗亲吻了婴孩之后，把孩子送还。

教宗方济各走出一架商业班机，开始对巴西的访问时，巴西总统罗塞夫和众多名流政要在机场迎接了这位阿根廷出生的前主教。
后来，反政府示威者与举行欢迎教宗仪式的瓜纳巴拉宫外面的警察发生冲突。来自现场的报道说，看来人们的愤怒情绪是针对巴西领导人，而并非针对教宗。

**Pope Francis Embraced on Arrival in Brazil**

Tens of thousands of cheering faithful greeted Pope Francis Monday on his arrival in Brazil, mobbing a motorcade carrying the pontiff into central Rio de Janeiro at the start of a weeklong visit.

Video showed security officers struggling at several points to push back the joyous crowds, while the pope rolled down the window of his car to touch those who reached inside. One woman handed the 76-year-old pope an infant, whom he kissed before handing back.

Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff and a host of dignitaries met the Argentine-born Francis -- the former Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio -- as he stepped off a commercial airliner to begin his visit.

Later, anti-government protesters clashed with police outside the palace holding the official papal welcoming ceremony. Reports from the scene said crowd anger appeared directed at Brazilian leaders, not at the pontiff.
