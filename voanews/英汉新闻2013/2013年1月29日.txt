**美国参议院通过超级风暴救援议案**

美国国会已经完成了为“桑迪”超级风暴受害者提供505亿美元紧急救援的程序。三个月前，这场超级风暴在纽约和新泽西沿海地区造成严重破坏。

星期一，美国国会参议院以62票对36票通过了这项议案。众议院于本月早些时候通过这项议案，奥巴马总统已经承诺将尽快签署这项议案。

“桑迪”是自有记录以来侵袭美国东北部的最猛烈风暴之一。由于美国经济状况不佳，围绕提供救援的讨论变得复杂化。1月初，一项救援议案提交众议院表决，但由于有关开支问题的争论，表决未能进行。在此几天后，新国会宣誓就任，不得不重新就救援方案进行谈判。

共和党控制的众议院的拖延招致了纽约州民主党籍州长科莫以及新泽西州共和党籍州长克里斯蒂的批评。
**U.S. Senate Passes Superstorm Aid **

The U.S. Congress has completed action on a $50.5 billion package of emergency relief for the victims of Superstorm Sandy, three months after the storm severely damaged the New York and New Jersey coastlines.

Members of the Senate approved the bill Monday by a vote of 62 to 36. The House passed the legislation earlier this month, and President Barack Obama has promised to sign it as soon as it reaches his desk.

Discussions about aid for one of the worst storms ever to hit the U.S. northeast have been complicated by the nation's poor economic situation. An aid package was up for a vote in the House in early January, but members failed to vote on it because of disputes over spending. When new members of Congress were sworn in a few days later, negotiations on storm aid had to start over again.

The delay in the Republican-controlled House triggered criticism from Democratic New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.
**9-11恐怖袭击被告拒绝接受美国指定的律师**

在星期一举行审前听证的第一天，被控谋划2001年9月11号对美国进行恐怖袭击的被告之一拒绝一位美国军方律师为自己辩护。

瓦利德•本•阿塔什抱怨说，他不信任辩护律师，并说美国政府对他的辩护进行压制。

在古巴关塔那摩湾美国海军基地主持听证的法官们还面临着一个难题，即在多大程度上公开听证的过程。

记者和证人与被告不在同一个房间。星期一，为记者和证人提供的被告音频曾一度中断。没有人愿意透露是谁决定中断提供音频，但军方官员说，中断音频的原因可能是防止泄露机密信息。

美国国防部面临着来自人权组织和记者的压力，他们要求对被告进行公开审判。

** Terror Suspect Rejects US-Appointed Lawyer**

One of the accused masterminds of the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States in 2001 fired one of his military lawyers on the first day of pretrial hearings Monday.

Walid bin Attash complained that he does not trust his attorneys, and said the government is stifling his defense.

Judges presiding at the hearings, held at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, are also struggling with questions about how much of the proceedings should be made public.

Reporters and witnesses are not in the same room as the defendants. The audio feed to them went silent unexpectedly at one point Monday. No one would say who authorized the interruption, but military officials say audio may have been cut to prevent anyone from hearing classified information.

The Pentagon is under pressure from human-rights groups and journalists for a open trial.
