**美国就网络安全问题向中国提出警告**

美国白宫一名高级官员呼吁中国认真采取措施停止网络入侵，并说这是美中关系中越来越大的挑战。

白宫安全顾问多尼伦星期一说，中国当局必须认识到问题的严重性，并与美国就可接受的网络行为举行谈判。

中国外交部发言人华春莹星期二表示，北京可以就这个问题与美国会谈，但是她坚持认为中国是网侵的受害者，而不是网络犯罪人。

美国一些大型科技公司，如苹果公司、脸书和推特等，今年早些时候都遭到黑客的入侵。纽约时报、华尔街日报和华盛顿邮报也都表示受到源自中国黑客的入侵。

白宫安全顾问多尼伦星期一在纽约对亚洲协会表示，中国对美国网络的入侵不仅是国家安全问题，也是一个经济问题。他说，美国企业对使用高科技有目标地窃取商业机密的做法越来越担心。

美国上个月公布了反击黑客和网络间谍的新战略，其中包括对那些盗取贸易机密的人或机构进行罚款并采取贸易行动。

一些美国国会议员估计，去年网上商业机密的盗窃给美国公司造成3千亿美元的损失，其中大部分是源自中国的网络间谍的入侵。

**US Warns China on Cyber Security**

A senior White House official is calling on China to take "serious steps" to stop cybercrimes, saying the issue is a "growing challenge" to U.S.-China relations.

National Security Advisor Tom Donilon on Monday called on China to acknowledge the scope of the problem and engage in talks with the U.S. on acceptable behavior in cyberspace.

Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said Tuesday that Beijing was open to talks, but insisted that China is a victim, not perpetrator of computer crimes.

Several large U.S. technology companies, including Apple, Facebook, and Twitter, were hacked earlier this year. The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and Washington Post newspapers also say they were attacked by China-based hackers.

In a speech Monday to the Asia Society in New York, Donilon said Chinese hacking attempts represent not only a national security concern, but also an economic one. He said U.S. businesses are increasingly concerned about "sophisticated, targeted theft of confidential business information."

The U.S. last month unveiled a new strategy to counter hackers and cyber spies, including the use of fines and trade actions against those targeting trade secrets.

Some U.S. lawmakers estimate that American companies lost more than $300 billion last year to trade secret theft, much of it to due to hacking by Chinese cyber spies.


**朝鲜威胁要让韩国一岛屿陷入火海**

朝鲜领导人金正恩威胁要攻击韩国边界的一个岛屿，作为对美韩正在进行的年度军演的回应。

朝鲜官方媒体星期二报道说，金正恩命令边防前线部队做好战斗准备，摧毁白翎岛上的敌人目标。2010年，朝鲜在白翎岛附近发动过致命袭击。

自从上星期联合国因核试验而对朝鲜实施制裁以来，朝鲜发出了一系列严厉威胁。这是最新的一次。

韩国国防部发言人金珉奭星期二说，目前还没有关于朝鲜准备进攻或者进行武器试验的任何迹象。他说，朝鲜只是试图对韩国施加心理压力。

**N.Korea Threatens to Turn S.Korean Island into 'Sea of Flames'**

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has threatened to attack a South Korean border island in response to Seoul and Washington's ongoing annual military exercises.

Mr. Kim was quoted in state media Tuesday as telling front-line troops to prepare to destroy "enemy targets" on Baengnyeong island, near the site of a deadly North Korean attack in 2010.

It is the latest in a series of dramatic threats by North Korea following last week's U.N. sanctions over its latest nuclear test.

Seoul's Defense Ministry spokesperson Kim Min-seok on Tuesday said there is no evidence of an impending attack or weapons test by North Korea, which he said is just trying to put "psychological pressure" on the South.
