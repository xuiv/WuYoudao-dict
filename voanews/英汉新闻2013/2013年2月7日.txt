*美国中情局长候任人将就无人机政策接受质询**

星期四，美国国会参议院一个委员会将就无人机袭击政策对奥巴马总统提名的中央情报局长人选布伦南进行质询，该政策允许对据信参与国外恐怖主义活动的美国公民进行无人机袭击。

白宫反恐事务顾问布伦南将出席参议院情报委员会的听证会。布伦南是坚决支持奥巴马政府反恐政策的人士。

一名美国政府官员星期三说，奥巴马总统已经命令司法部向国会提交有关的机密法律文件，这些文件意在说明这类袭击的合理性。美国司法部星期二泄露的一份备忘录扩大了判断是否袭击恐怖嫌疑人的依据范围，此后11名美国参议员要求了解有关方面的法律文件。

美国政府原来认定如果据信恐怖袭击在即，就可以发动无人机袭击。但泄露的备忘录说，如果某美国公民在参与恐怖主义阴谋，就可以列为无人机空袭的目标。

**CIA Nominee Faces Questions on Drone Policy**

A Senate committee Thursday will question President Barack Obama's choice to head the CIA about a policy allowing drone strikes on American citizens allegedly involved in terrorism overseas.

White House anti-terror adviser John Brennan will appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee. Brennan is a strong supporter of the administration's anti-terror policies.

On Wednesday, an administration official said President Obama has ordered the Justice Department to give Congress classified legal documents justifying the drone strikes. Eleven senators had demanded to see the documents after a leaked Justice Department memo broadened the rationale for targeting alleged terrorists.

The administration has previously justified drone attacks if a terrorist strike is believed to be imminent. But the memo says an American citizen may also be targeted for being part of an ongoing terror plot.

**朝鲜威胁将南北双方设立的边境工业园区划为军事区**

朝鲜半岛紧张局势升级，对南北双方的一个合资工业项目构成威胁，这一项目是首尔与平壤和解的现存几个象征之一。

朝鲜警告韩国说，如果首尔坚持誓言要加紧对开城工业园区的检查，平壤就将放弃这一项目，并把那一边境地区划为军事区。

韩国统一部本星期早些时候说，由于联合国针对平壤去年11月发射被禁的火箭而扩大对朝鲜的制裁，韩国将更密切地监督进入开城工业园区的工业零部件和其他货物。

朝鲜对联合国的制裁做出愤怒反应，誓言将发射更多火箭以及再次进行核试验，预计平壤将在几天内进行核试验。

**N.Korea Threatens to Turn Joint Border Industrial Complex into Military
Zone**

Rising tensions on the Korean peninsula are jeopardizing a joint industrial project that has served as one of the few remaining symbols of reconciliation between Seoul and Pyongyang.

North Korea has warned the South it will abandon the Kaesong Industrial Complex and turn the border area back into a military zone if Seoul follows through on its pledge to tighten inspections there.

Earlier this week, Seoul's Unification Ministry said it would more closely monitor industrial parts and other cargo shipped into the facility, as a result of expanded U.N. sanctions against Pyongyang following a banned November rocket launch.

North Korean has reacted angrily to the sanctions, promising to launch more missiles and conduct another nuclear test, which is expected to take place in just days.
