**中国当局拘留呼吁政府更加透明的活动人士**

中国当局以“煽动颠覆国家政权罪”拘留了江西活动人士刘萍。此前刘萍曾倡议政府官员财产公开。

刘萍的律师说，江西警方上个月拘留了48岁的活动人士刘萍。目前还没有公布“煽动颠覆国家政权罪”的任何法定文书。这种罪名通常针对的是政府的批评人士。

另一方面，北京警方据称拘留了10名反腐败活动人士。一些被拘留人士的一名律师对法新社说，在活动人士打出横幅，呼吁政府增加透明度后，警方指控这些人“非法集会”。

人权组织说，这些人被拘留让人们质疑中国新领导人习近平打击政府腐败的承诺。

自从去年中共10年一次的权力更迭以来，以习近平为首的新的中共中央政府誓言要解决腐败盛行的问题，中共警告说，腐败将可危及中共的政权。

但是政府还压制那些要揭露腐败的人，并加紧在互联网上对政府腐败批评的审查。当局认为，这些批评太敏感。

**China Detains Activists Calling for Greater Government Transparency**

Chinese authorities have detained an activist for "inciting subversion" after she led a campaign pushing for government officials to publicly disclose their wealth.

A lawyer for Liu Ping says police in province of Jiangxi detained the 48-year-old activist last month. There has not been any public statement on the subversion charges, an accusation often made against government critics.

Separately, Beijing police have reportedly detained 10 other anti-corruption activists. A lawyer for some of those detained told the French news agency police charged the activists with "unlawful assembly" after they displayed a banner calling for greater government transparency.

Rights groups say the detentions call into question the stated commitment of China's new leader Xi Jinping to crack down on government corruption.

Since taking power last year in a once-a-decade power transfer, the new Communist government led by Mr. Xi has vowed to address the widespread corruption, warning it could threaten the party's grip on power.

But the government has also cracked down on those who wish to expose corruption. It has also tightly censored online criticism of government corruption that it views as being too sensitive.

**7 Killed in Bangladesh Garment Factory Fire **

Officials in Bangladesh say at least seven people died in a fire in a garment factory in the capital late Wednesday.

The fire erupted in the Tung Hai Sweater Factory in Dhaka's Mirpur district after most workers had gone home.

Authorities say police and garment factory officials were holding a meeting in the 11-story building when the fire broke out.

Earlier Wednesday, the Bangladesh government said it had shut down 18 garment factories for safety reasons following the April 24 collapse of a building housing five garment factories. The death toll from that incident has risen to more than 800.

Bangladesh's $20-billion textile industry accounts for nearly 80 percent of the country's exports.
