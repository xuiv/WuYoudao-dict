**奥廷加竞选伙伴说肯尼亚选举点票遭“修改”**

肯尼亚总统选举候选人奥廷加的竞选伙伴说，星期一选举的点票过程”不完善“，应该停止。

卡伦佐•穆斯约卡星期四在内罗毕对记者说了这番话。同时，由于新的电子系统出现故障，选举官员在继续手工点票。

到星期四早晨，点票工作已经对预计的选票进行了将近一半的清点。清点的结果显示，肯雅塔的得票以53%比42%领先于他的主要对手奥廷加总理。

选举官员说，正式选举结果最早可能在星期五公布。但是根据法律，点票工作可以最晚在星期一结束。

尽管存在一些问题，国际观察人士指称肯尼亚选举过程是透明和可信的。

**Odinga Running Mate Says Kenya Vote Count 'Doctored'**

The running mate of Kenyan presidential candidate Raila Odinga says the vote-counting process from Monday's election "lacks integrity" and should be stopped.

Kalonzo Musyoka spoke to reporters Thursday in Nairobi, while election officials continued to manually count ballots after a new electronic system broke down.

Close to half of the estimated votes were tallied by early Thursday, showing Uhuru Kenyatta leading Prime Minister Odinda by a 53 percent to 42 percent margin.

Officials say the final results could be released as early as Friday, but they legally have until Monday to finish the count.

Despite some problems, international observers have described the vote as transparent and credible.

**联合国将批准对朝鲜核项目实施严厉制裁**

针对平壤最近进行核试验，联合国安理会准备批准对朝鲜实施严厉的新制裁，尽管平壤发出警告说，将对此做出回应，废除已经存在60年的朝鲜停战协定。

外交官们说，联合国安理会将于星期四就美国起草的一项决议案进行表决，该决议案是联合国对朝鲜实行一些迄今为止最严厉的制裁。

韩国外交部发言人赵泰永说，首尔对这项决议草案感到满意。这项决议案看来已经得到安理会所有15个成员国的支持。

这项决议案规定，断绝有助于平壤核项目及导弹项目的一切金融服务和资金转帐，对朝鲜有关人员实行更严格的旅行禁令，并加强对进出朝鲜的货物的检查。

在安理会就这项决议案进行表决之前，朝鲜威胁要废除结束朝鲜战争的1953年停战协定，并宣布举行一系列军事演习，与美国和韩国的军演抗衡。有报道说，朝鲜目前采取措施，对公共交通系统进行伪装，并播送本国公民支持开战的言论。

韩国誓言如果朝鲜做出任何军事行动，韩国方面就要采取迅速的报复。韩国国防部说，首尔当局密切监视边界情况。

**UN Set to Approve Tough Sanctions on N. Korea Nuke Program**

The U.N. Security Council is set to approve tough new sanctions to punish North Korea for its latest nuclear test, despite warnings from Pyongyang that it will end a 60-year-old ceasefire with South Korea in response.

Diplomats say the council will vote early Thursday on the U.S.-drafted resolution, which would impose some of the strongest sanctions ever ordered by the United Nations.

South Korean foreign ministry spokesperson Cho Tai-young says Seoul is satisfied with the draft text, which appears to have the support of all 15 Security Council members.

The resolution would block any financial services or money transfers that help Pyongyang's nuclear or missile programs. It would also tighten travel bans and strengthen inspections of cargo into and out of North Korea.

Ahead of the vote, North Korea has threatened to void the 1953 armistice that ended the Korean war. It has also announced a series of military exercises to compete with drills being held by the U.S. and South Korea. Reports say Pyongyang has been taking steps to camouflage public transport and broadcast messages from citizens in favor of war.

The South has vowed swift retaliation in the event of any North Korean military action. Defense ministry spokesperson says Seoul is closely monitoring the border.
