**中国法庭将受理薄熙来的上诉**

一家中国法院说，薄熙来将被准许就其被判受贿、贪污和滥用职权罪名成立的裁决提出上诉。

山东省高级法院星期三说，薄熙来拒绝接受上月法庭做出的裁决。薄熙来被判处无期徒刑。

山东省高级法院没有说明对薄熙来上诉进行审理的日期。但观察人士说，由于中国高层领导人已经决定了薄熙来的命运，他的上诉不大可能获得成功。

**Chinese Court to Hear Bo Xilai Appeal**

A Chinese court says disgraced former politician Bo Xilai will be allowed to appeal his conviction on bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power.

The high court in the eastern province of Shandong said Wednesday that Bo "refused to accept the decision" at his trial last month, which resulted in a sentence of life in prison.

The statement did not say when the appeal would be heard. But observers say it is unlikely to succeed, since China's top leaders have already decided Bo's fate.

**奥巴马：美国从不拖欠债务**

美国总统奥巴马星期二试图使世界放心，美国虽然面临着提高债务上限的最后期限，但美国从不拖欠债务。

奥巴马星期二对记者说，国会传出的有关债务违约可能不会损害全球经济的说法使投资者感到紧张。奥巴马敦促国会就提高债务上限的议案进行表决，议案中不应附带任何其他问题。

奥巴马还呼吁众议院通过一项不附加任何条件的预算案，使政府恢复运转。美国政府关闭已进入第二个星期。

共和党籍的众议院议长贝纳说，他对奥巴马拒绝就债务上限以及开支议案进行谈判感到失望。他表示，这不是美国政府体系的行事方式。
贝纳说，债务上限一直是一个得到公平谈判的问题。他还说，美国不能继续花自己没有的钱。
Obama: US Has Always Paid Its Bills

President Barack Obama tried to reassure the world Tuesday that the United States has always paid its bills, as the country faces a deadline to raise the debt ceiling.

Mr. Obama told journalists Tuesday that remarks from Congress indicating a debt default may not damage the world economic recovery make investors nervous. He called on Congress to hold a clean vote on raising the debt ceiling -- a vote with no other issues attached.

Mr. Obama also appealed to Congress to pass a clean spending bill and reopen the government -- now in its second week of a shutdown.

Republican House Speaker John Boehner said he is disappointed the president is refusing to negotiate on the debt limit or a spending bill. He said this is not the American system of government.

Boehner said the debt limit has always been fair game for bargaining, and he said the United States cannot keep spending money it does not have.
