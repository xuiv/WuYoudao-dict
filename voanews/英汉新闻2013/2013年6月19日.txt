**奥巴马将在柏林演讲 推动世界无核化**

美国总统奥巴马星期三即将在具有历史意义的柏林勃兰登堡门发表演讲，提出争取实现世界无核化的设想。

在计划开始演讲的几个小时前，奥巴马会晤了德国总理默克尔，会谈的各项议题包括美国的互联网监控项目问题。

在会晤后的联合记者会上，默克尔说，虽然“敌人和对手”也会利用互联网威胁民主，但是她对美国总统奥巴马强调说，在监视威胁与维护“自由秩序”之间，应当保持“平衡与比例适度”。

奥巴马则说，美国的互联网监视项目是“有限度的”和“狭窄的”。他坚持说，美国情报机构不会查看德国、美国或任何国家普通公民的电邮，网络与电话监控项目是在联邦法庭监督之下进行的。

他说，他的政府在保护美国人民与维持“民权自由和隐私”之间找到了“适度的平衡”。他还重申，监控项目“挽救了生命”。



Obama to Promote Nuclear-Free World in Berlin Speech


U.S. President Barack Obama is set to lay out his vision for advancing toward a world free of nuclear weapons during a speech Wednesday at the historic Brandenburg Gate in Berlin.

Hours before the planned address, Mr. Obama met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel for talks that covered, among other things, U.S. Internet surveillance.

In a joint news conference afterwards, Mrs. Merkel said that while "enemies and opponents" can use the Internet to threaten democracy, she had stressed to the U.S president that there should be "balance and proportionality" between the need to monitor threats and to preserve a "liberal order."

Mr. Obama, for his part, called the U.S. Internet surveillance program "circumscribed" and "narrow," insisting that U.S. intelligence agencies are not "rifling through ordinary emails" of "German citizens or American citizens or anyone else" and that the Internet and telephone surveillance programs are under federal court supervision.

He said his administration has struck "the appropriate balance" between protecting the American people and preserving "civil liberty and privacy." He also reiterated that the surveillance programs have "saved lives."

'Most Wanted' US Fugitive Arrested in Mexico


A former U.S. college professor who was recently placed on the FBI's notorious list of most wanted criminals has been arrested in Mexico.

Authorities say Walter Lee Williams was captured late Tuesday in the southern resort city of Playa del Carmen, just one day after he was placed on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. The 64-year-old is facing four charges related to the sexual abuse and exploitation of children.

Williams is alleged to have traveled to the Philippines in 2011 to engage in sexual acts with two 14-year-old boys he met online the year before. He is also accused of taking sexually explicit photos of one of the boys.

Until 2011, Williams was an anthropology professor at the University of Southern California, where his field of study was gender development.
