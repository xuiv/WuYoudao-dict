**韩朝就滞留人员撤离开车的谈判取得进展 **

韩国说，与朝鲜就允许仍滞留在停顿状态的开城工业园区韩国人员撤离的磋商正取得进展。

但是韩国统一部说，在最后滞留的7名韩国人能离开开城工业园区之前，需要更多的时间解决未支付的税款和工资。

双方最后一刻的争议使这7名员工无法同最后一批43名韩国人于星期一一起返回韩国。如果这些韩国人撤离，将打破朝鲜半岛敌对双方最后的和平联系。

上个月，朝鲜撤走其5万3千名工人，并阻止韩国人进入园区。这是朝鲜对联合国制裁其最近的一次核试验做出的愤怒反应的一部分。

** S. Korea Reports Progress on Remaining Workers at Kaesong Complex**

South Korea says it is making progress with the North on allowing the return of its workers who remain at a suspended joint industrial zone just north of the border.

But the South's Unification Ministry says more time is needed to resolve issues such as unpaid taxes and wages before the seven remaining South Koreans can leave the Kaesong industrial complex.

The last-minute dispute prevented the workers from leaving along with the last 43 South Koreans who returned home Monday. If they leave, it would break the final peaceful link between the two foes.

North Korea pulled its 53,000 workers and blocked South Korean entry to the facility last month, as part of its angry reaction to expanded United Nations sanctions against its latest nuclear test.


**沙特石油部长：美国的能源独立想法是幼稚的**


沙特阿拉伯石油部长欧那密表示，美国认为自己不必依靠中东石油，能实现石油独立的想法是幼稚的。

欧那密星期二在华盛顿演讲时表示，他欢迎美国提高石油和天然气产量，因为这对美国经济和世界石油供应是好事。

但是他说，能源独立的想法是幼稚并过于简单的，因为国际能源市场是相互关联的。

自从1973年中东地区实行石油禁运以来，包括奥巴马总统及前美国总统在内的很多美国人认为，美国必须停止依赖外国石油进口。他们说，能源自主对美国国家安全来说是至关重要的。
** Saudi Oil Minister: US Energy Independence is Naive **

Saudi Arabian oil minister Ali al-Naimi says the United States is naive to think it could become independent from Middle East oil.

Al-Naimi told an audience in Washington Tuesday that he welcomes an increase in U.S. oil and gas production as good for the U.S. economy and world oil supplies.

But he said the idea of energy independence is naive and simplistic, because he said global energy markets are interconnected.

Since the 1973 Middle East oil embargo, many Americans, including President Barack Obama and his predecessors, have said the United States must stop depending on foreign oil. They say energy independence is crucial for U.S. national security.
