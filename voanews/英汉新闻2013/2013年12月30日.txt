**中国官员：3百多万公顷农田污染过重不宜耕种**


一名中国内阁官员说，中国333万公顷农田的污染程度过重，已经不宜耕种。

中国国土资源部副部长王世元星期一在记者会上说，中国政府正在拟定一项长期计划，预计每年将花费数十亿美元来清除农田污染。

中国的工业发展、过度使用农业化学制剂以及疏于环境保护使得大片农田受到铅、镉、杀虫剂以及其他污染物的损害。

今年，检查人员在广州出售的大米中发现了会诱发癌症的镉。这些大米是河南省出产的，而河南是重金属主要产地。

China Says more than 3 Million Hectares of Land Too Polluted to Farm

A Chinese Cabinet official says about 3.33 million hectares of the country's farmland is too polluted to grow crops.

Wang Shiyuan, vice-minister of land and resources, told a news briefing on Monday that the government is working on a long-range plan and expects to spend billions of dollars a year on a cleanup effort.

The growth of Chinese industry, overuse of farm chemicals and lax environmental enforcement have left swathes of the countryside tainted by lead, cadmium, pesticides and other toxins.

This year, inspectors found dangerous levels of cadmium, a cancer-causing metal, in rice sold in the southern city of Guangzhou. The rice was grown in Henan, a major heavy metal-producing region.

**日本股市创40年最大增幅**


在2013年的最后一个交易日，日本股市年度增幅达到57%，这是自1972年以来的最好表现。

分析人士认为，日本股市的强势应归功于日本政府和中央银行实行的政策使日元对美元的汇率大幅降低，促进了日本出口，外国投资大量注入日本市场。自今年年初以来，日本对美元的汇率降低了大约20%。

星期一，日经指数连续第九天上升，这是自2009年7月以来持续时间最长的涨势。

日本首相安倍晋三采取强有力的经济刺激措施后，日本股市呈现强势。

日本是世界第三大经济体，仅次于美国和中国。


Japan Markets Close at 4 Decade High


On the last trading day of 2013, Japanese shares closed at a 57 percent annual gain, their best annual performance since 1972.

Analysts attribute the record to foreign investors jumping into the Japanese market after the government and central bank initiated policies that sent the yen plummeting against the dollar, making Japanese exports very popular. The Japanese currency has lost about a fifth of its values against the dollar since the start of the year.

The benchmark Nikkei average rose for a ninth day (to end 0.7 percent higher at 15,291.31) Monday, its longest winning streak since July of 2009.

The big gains follow an aggressive economic stimulus by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

As a country, Japan has the world's third-largest economy, behind the United States and China.
