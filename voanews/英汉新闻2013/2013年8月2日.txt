US to Close Embassies August 4

The United States will close a number of its embassies and consulates around the world on Sunday for security reasons.

The State Department did not specify which missions have been asked to close, nor the type of threat they face. But a statment said the embassies and consulates that have been told to close are ones normally open on Sundays. That would include embassies in the Muslim world, where the work week generally is from Sunday to Thursday.

Spokeswoman Marie Harf called the move a precautionary measure.

**美俄关系因斯诺登获庇护紧绷**

奥巴马政府对俄罗斯给予逃亡的美国情报泄密者爱德华•斯诺登临时庇护表示“极度失望”。

在被困一个多月之后，斯诺登星期四离开了莫斯科机场的转机区。斯诺登的律师说，他获得一年庇护期以及一份工作许可，并被带到了一个秘密地点。

斯诺登的俄罗斯律师表示，斯诺登有计划在未来接受新闻媒体采访，但必须得等到他对新的环境适应了之后。

白宫发言人卡尼说，官员们正在重新评估下个月奥巴马总统和普京总统在莫斯科举行会晤的必要性。他说，克里姆林宫对于美国公开和私下提出的把斯诺登送回美国受审的非常明确的要求未予理睬。

US, Russian Ties Strained by Snowden's Asylum

The Obama administration says it is "extremely disappointed" that Russia has granted fugitive U.S. intelligence leaker Edward Snowden temporary asylum.

Snowden left the transit zone of the Moscow airport Thursday after being stuck there for more than a month. His lawyer said he was given a year's asylum and a work permit, and was taken to a secret location.

His Russian lawyer says Snowden is planning to speak with the news media in the future, but only after getting acclimated to his new situation.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said Thursday that officials are reevaluating next month's scheduled talks between Presidents Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin in Moscow. He said the Kremlin ignored very clear requests, in public and in private, that Snowden be sent back to the United States for trial.
