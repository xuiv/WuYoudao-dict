**朝鲜谴责联合国制裁措施**

联合国安理会决定针对朝鲜去年12月发射火箭，对其实行更严厉的制裁，此后引起朝鲜挑战性的暗示它将再次进行核试验。

星期二，安理会15个成员国一致通过一项决议案，谴责朝鲜违反联合国现有制裁规定，以发射火箭作为伪装来试射弹道导弹。安理会还警告说，如果平壤再进行发射或试验，就将采取“重大行动”。

朝鲜立即做出反应，声称不再参与任何非核化会谈。此外，朝鲜还誓言增强军力和“核威慑力量”，很多人士将这一声明解释为朝鲜再次进行核试验的威胁。

联合国对朝鲜的远程导弹发射实施制裁后，平壤方面曾进行了两次核试验。最近的卫星照片显示，朝鲜可能正在准备进行第3次核试验。

**North Korea Denounces UN Action on Sanctions **

The United Nations Security Council has ordered tougher sanctions against North Korea for its December rocket launch, prompting Pyongyang to defiantly hint at another nuclear test.

The 15-member Security Council on Tuesday voted unanimously to condemn the launch as a ballistic missile test banned under existing U.N. sanctions. It also threatened to take "significant action" if Pyongyang conducts more launches or tests.

North Korea responded immediately, saying it would hold no more talks on de-nuclearization. It also vowed to boost its military and "nuclear deterrence," a statement many interpreted as a threat to conduct another nuclear test.

Pyongyang has twice before conducted nuclear tests following U.N. sanctions imposed after long-range rocket launches. Recent satellite photos suggest it may be preparing to conduct a third test.

**非洲派驻马里军队将可能扩大一倍**

联合国官员说，由于需要更多军人协助马里政府从盘踞北部的伊斯兰激进分子手中夺回该地区的控制权，部署在马里的非洲干预部队可能比预期的3300人扩大一倍。

科特迪瓦常驻联合国代表巴姆巴是西非国家经济共同体在联合国的代言人。他说，目前已经在马里部署了将近1000名军人。星期二，巴姆巴敦促联合国安理会为非洲部队的行动提供紧急资金和后勤支援。

法国和马里军队已经阻止激进分子向南部推进。在去年3月政变后，激进分子控制了马里北部广大地区。

在马里城市加奥的一名美国之音记者说，自法国战机上星期轰炸伊斯兰激进分子的阵地后，大部分激进分子已经逃离加奥。

**African Force for Mali Could Double in Size**

U.N. officials say an African intervention force now deploying in Mali could double from its envisioned 3,300 troops, as more soldiers are needed to help regain control from Islamist militants holding the country's north.

Ivory Coast U.N. Ambassador Bamba, who represents the Economic Community of West African States at the United Nations, says nearly 1,000 troops already are in Mali. He urged the Security Council Tuesday to provide emergency financial and logistical support for the operation.

French and Malian forces have stopped a southward push by the militants, who seized the vast area of northern Mali following a March coup.

A VOA reporter in GAO says most Islamist militants have fled the city since last week, when French warplanes bombed their positions.
