**Taliban Stage Brazen Assault Near Afghan Presidential Palace**
Afghan authorities say Taliban militants have carried out a brazen attack near the presidential palace in Kabul, killing three security guards before all of the assailants were killed.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the early Tuesday morning assault, during which explosions and gunfire rang out in a heavily fortified area of the capital that also houses the defense ministry and the U.S. Embassy.
Authorities said the attackers approached the presidential palace in two vehicles laden with explosives. They said the occupants of one of the vehicles bluffed their way through a checkpoint by presenting false papers and wearing military-style uniforms.
Afghan officials said the second car was stopped outside the gate when assailants in both vehicles began shooting and setting off their explosives.
The assault came as reporters were gathering at the palace for a press event with Afghan President Hamid Karzai. The whereabouts of Mr. Karzai, who lives in the building, were not immediately clear.
