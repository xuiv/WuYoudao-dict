Obama to Meet Again With Republicans on Shutdown

U.S. President Barack Obama and Republican congressional leaders are expected to meet Friday to continue talks on the federal budget, in hopes of ending the government partial shutdown and preventing the country from defaulting on its debt.

Friday's talks come as the shutdown enters its 11th day, with next week's deadline for raising the debt ceiling fast approaching.

Meanwhile, the political impact of the shutdown on the U.S. political landscape was illustrated Thursday by a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll of 800 people. It indicated that 53 percent of respondents blame the shutdown on Republicans, while 31 percent blame it on Democrats.

On Thursday, President Obama held separate meetings with top congressional Democrats and Republicans.

Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives John Boehner's office called the talks useful and productive, and said meetings at the staff level would continue throughout the night.
**在朝鲜被监禁的美国人之母探望儿子**

被监禁在朝鲜的美国传教士裴俊浩的母亲抵达平壤探望儿子。裴俊浩已被监禁了11个月。
裴俊浩的母亲星期四抵达朝鲜，被安排在星期五上午同儿子见面。预计，她将在朝鲜停留五天左右。
裴俊浩被控犯有颠覆国家政权罪，并于今年5月被判处15年强制劳动。裴俊浩的家人说，他患有糖尿病，健康状况很差。
朝鲜本来提出准许美国特使罗伯特•金访问平壤，他访问的目的是说服朝鲜当局基于人道立场释放裴俊浩，但朝鲜随后收回了这一提议。有关官员说，取消这次访问的原因是美韩军队在韩国举行年度联合军事演习。

Mother of American Imprisoned in North Korea Visits Him

The mother of an American missionary detained in North Korea for the past 11 months has arrived in Pyongyang to visit her son.

Myunghee Bae arrived in North Korea Thursday and was scheduled to meet with her son, Kenneth Bae Friday morning. She is expected to stay in the North for about five days.

Kenneth Bae was sentenced in May to 15 years of hard labor on a conviction of state subversion. His family says he has diabetes and is in ill health.

North Korea rescinded an offer in August to allow senior U.S. envoy Robert King to visit Pyongyang to petition that Bae be freed on humanitarian grounds. Officials said the visit was canceled because of annual joint U.S.-South Korean military drills being held in the South.
