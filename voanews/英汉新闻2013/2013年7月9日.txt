**美中开始讨论网络安全问题**

在美中两国就扩大合作的四天会议的第一天，两国讨论了敏感的网络安全话题。

美国官员说，星期一在华盛顿举行的会议上，他们提出了跟经济有关的黑客入侵问题。他们还说，双方还讨论了为网络空间制定国际准则问题。

华盛顿和北京在四月同意，工作小组就网络安全问题举行对话，这个问题可能成为破坏双边关系的主要威胁。

奥巴马政府指责中国参与一项广泛的互联网入侵行动，行动的目的是窃取美国政府机构和企业的秘密，以获得经济利益。

官员们希望，在双方部长星期三和星期四在华盛顿举行安全与经济对话之前，能够取得进展。

中国代表团团长杨洁篪表示，他希望这次对话能为美中之间创造更多的合作。


**US, China Discuss Cyber Security as Dialogue Begins**

The United States and China discussed the sensitive topic of cyber security during the first of four days of talks aimed at expanding cooperation between the two world powers.

U.S. officials say they raised the issue of economic-related hacking during the Monday session in Washington. They also said the two sides discussed international norms for cyber space.

Washington and Beijing agreed in April to hold the working group on cyber security, which has threatened to become a major irritant in bilateral relations.

The Obama administration has accused China of involvement in a broad Internet hacking campaign to steal secrets from U.S. government institutions and businesses for economic gain.

Officials hope to make progress before senior ministers of the two sides hold annual security and economic talks in the U.S. capital Wednesday and Thursday.

Yang Jiechi, a high-ranking Chinese official who is heading Beijing's delegation, says he hopes the dialogue can create more cooperation between the U.S. and China.

**日本：中国试图用武力改变地区现状**

日本年度防务白皮书说，越来越大胆放肆的中国正在企图通过武力改变该地区的现状。

星期二通过的这份白皮书很可能会受到北京的猛烈抨击，中国跟日本卷入东海的领土争端。

中国向有争议的岛屿附近定期派出巡逻船和飞机，这被视为企图挑战日本对这些岛屿的控制权。

防务白皮书称中国的这些做法是“危险”和“非常遗憾”的，并警告说这将导致未来的“不测事态”。

白皮书特别批评中国今年一月一艘中国海军舰船将火控雷达锁定一艘日本驱逐舰。中国否认指控，称日本的指控不准确和具有挑衅性。
这是鹰派安倍晋三首相现政府发布的第一份白皮书。安倍晋三去年12月上任以来，在岛屿主权争端问题上采取坚定立场。

**China Trying to Change Regional Status Quo 'By Force:' Japan**

Japan's annual defense paper says an increasingly bold China is attempting to change the regional status quo by force.

The paper adopted Tuesday is likely to be slammed by Beijing, which is involved in a territorial dispute with Japan in the East China Sea.
China has sent regular patrol boats and aircraft near the disputed islands, in what as seen as an attempt to challenge Japan's control of them.

The report called such actions "dangerous" and "extremely regrettable," warning it could cause a "contingency" in the future.

In particular, the paper criticized China for a January incident in which a Chinese navy boat locked its pre-firing radar on a Japanese destroyer. China has denied the claim, calling it inaccurate and provocative.

The white paper is the first released under the current government of hawkish Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has taken a firm stance on the island issue since coming to power in December.
