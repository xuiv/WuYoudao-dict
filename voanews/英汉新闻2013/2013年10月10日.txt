**加拿大作家爱丽丝•门罗获诺贝尔文学奖**

加拿大短篇小说家爱丽丝•门罗（Alice Munro）荣获2013年诺贝尔文学奖。瑞士诺贝尔奖委员会星期四宣布这项决定时称82岁的门罗是“当代短篇小说大师”。

门罗1931年生于安大略省温格姆镇，不到20岁即开始写小说，几十年来发表了多部小说集，并多次获奖，其中包括加拿大的最高文学奖“总督奖”。

诺贝尔文学奖很可能是门罗事业的顶点，她今年早些时候表示可能不会再写作了。

爱丽丝•门罗是获得诺贝尔文学奖的第13位女性。她说，希望她的获奖会让人们看到短篇小说是个重要的艺术，并不是长篇小说创作前的练笔。

诺贝尔奖委员会星期五将公布今年的诺贝尔和平奖得主。

Canada's Alice Munro Wins 2013 Nobel Literature Prize

Canadian short story writer Alice Munro has been awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. In announcing its decision Thursday, the Swedish Academy called the 82-year-old author the "master of the contemporary short story."

Munro began writing in her teens, and published many collections of stories over the decades. She has won numerous literary prizes, including the Governor General's prize, Canada's highest literary honor. The Nobel is likely to be the capstone of her career. She said earlier this year that she was "probably not going to write anymore."

Munro is the 13th woman to win the Literature prize. She said she hoped the award "would make people see the short story as an important art; not just something you played around with until you get a novel written."

The Nobel announcements continue Friday with the Peace Prize.

欧洲联盟将欧洲最高人权奖颁发给巴基斯坦维权少女马拉拉.尤萨法扎伊。马拉拉因为妇女争取受教育的权利而遭到塔利班武装分子的枪击。

欧盟星期四在布鲁塞尔宣布把鼓励思想自由的“萨哈罗夫奖”颁发给马拉拉。奖金为6万5千美元。

马拉拉11岁时就成为活动人士，呼吁巴基斯坦斯瓦特河谷地区提倡妇女自由以及女性受教育和自决的权利。2009年当地的塔利班禁止女孩上学读书。马拉拉开始写博客，以笔名撰文，很快成为维护女性权利的突出声音。

2012年她在校车上遭到塔利班武装分子几乎是致命的枪击。后来她在英国接受多次手术，去除了颈部的一颗子弹，并通过手术减轻脑部肿胀。

她虽此后一直住在英国，但恢复了维权活动。她今年7月在联合国发表演讲，并在本周早些时候她被枪击一周年的时候出版了回忆录。
Pakistan's Malala Yousafzai Wins Sakharav Prize

The European Union has awarded its top human rights prize to Pakistani schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai, who was targeted for a Taliban attack for her efforts to promote education for women.

European Union lawmakers announced the winner of the $65,000 Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought Thursday in Brussels.

Malala was 11 when she became an activist for women's education, freedom, and self-determination in Pakistan's Swat Valley, where women were banned by the Taliban from attending school in 2009. She began a blog, writing under a pseudonym, and quickly became a prominent voice for women's rights.

She survived a nearly fatal Taliban assassination attempt while riding a school bus in 2012 and underwent multiple surgeries in Britain to remove a bullet to the neck and alleviate the swelling of her brain.

Since then, she has remained in Britain but resumed her activism, addressing the United Nations in July and publishing a memoir earlier this week, on the first anniversary of her attack.
