Hezbollah Accuses Israel of Killing Commander in Beirut

Lebanese militant group Hezbollah says one of its commanders has been killed and is blaming neighboring Israel for his death.

The group said in a statement Wednesday that Hassan al-Laqis was killed as he returned to his home in southern Beirut around midnight, but did not provide details. Security sources said he was shot while sitting in his car.

Hezbollah said Israel had tried to kill him several times in the past and must bear "full responsibility" for his death.

Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor denied Israel was involved, saying that Hezbollah has often automatically blamed Israel in the past.
