**向奥巴马投寄带毒信件的嫌疑人被逮捕**

美国调查人员说，在密西西比州逮捕了一名与寄给奥巴马总统带毒信件事件有关的嫌疑人。

美国联邦调查局说，嫌疑人柯蒂斯星期三在密西西比州的科林斯被逮捕。调查人员没有透露更多细节。

但记者看到的一份联邦调查局情报简报说，4月8号寄给奥巴马的带毒信件和寄给韦克尔参议员的带毒信件上的邮戳显示寄出地点是田纳西州的孟菲斯，而两封信件中的某些措辞完全一样。

这两封信件都初步检测出带有蓖麻油毒素，这是一种毒性极强的有毒化学制剂，极少量即可致命。

调查人员说，这两封信件分别被白宫和参议院的信件检查机构截获，因此没有对奥巴马总统和韦克尔参议员构成威胁。

**US Arrests Suspect in Poison Letter Sent to Obama**

U.S. investigators say a suspect in Mississippi has been arrested in connection with a poisoned letter sent to U.S. President Barack Obama.

The FBI said suspect Paul Kevin Curtis was arrested Wednesday in Corinth, Mississippi. Investigators did not provide further details.

However, an FBI intelligence bulletin seen by reporters said the suspect April 8 letter to Mr. Obama and a second one addressed to U.S. Senator Roger Wicker were postmarked in Memphis, Tennessee and contained some identical wording.

Both letters preliminarily tested positive for ricin, a highly poisonous chemical compound that is deadly in amounts as small as a grain of salt.

Investigators said both letters were intercepted at mail screening facilities away from the White House and Senate offices and consequently did not place either the president or the senator in immediate danger.
