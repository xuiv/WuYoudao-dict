**NTSB: 韩亚客机起落架撞上防波堤**

美国政府调查人员说，星期六在旧金山机场失事的韩亚航空公司客机的起落架在触到跑道之前撞到防波堤，致使机身滑向跑道一侧的场地。

美国国家交通安全委员会主席德博拉·赫斯曼星期二在旧金山的一次记者会上说，就在失事之前几秒钟，机上驾驶员试图纠正飞机航速和高度。

韩亚航空这架波音777客机降落时失事，造成两名中国女学生丧生，大约180人受伤。当时机上有300多人。

飞机上的飞行数据记录器的资料显示，飞机降落之前的速度太慢。赫斯曼拒绝对失事原因做出推测，不过，从美国国家交通安全委员会公布的大多数信息看出，驾驶员的失误是调查的重点。

** NTSB: Ill-Fated Asiana Jet's Landing Gear Hit Seawall in SF**

U.S. government investigators say the landing gear of the Asiana Airlines jet that crashed Saturday at San Francisco airport hit a seawall at the end of the runway, sending the fuselage skidding down the airfield.

The chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board, Deborah Hersman, told a news conference in San Francisco Tuesday that seconds before the crash, the pilots on board tried to correct the plane's speed and elevation.

Two Chinese schoolgirls were killed and about 180 of the more than 300 people on board were injured when the Boeing 777 crashed-landed.

Information from the plane's flight data recorder shows the plane was traveling far too slowly as it came in for a landing. Hersman declined to speculate on the cause of the crash, but much of the information released by the NTSB suggests pilot error as a main focus of the investigation.

**人权组织等促美国在年度对话期间对中国强硬**

人权组织和美国国会议员敦促奥巴马政府星期三跟中国官员在华盛顿举行高层年度对话期间采取强硬态度。

美国国务卿克里和财政部长杰克.卢率美国代表团出席本轮战略与经济对话。中方由国务委员杨洁篪和副总理汪洋率团。

今年是美中第五轮战略与经济对话。每年一度的对话给华盛顿和北京提供了一个机会，定期就合作与分歧进行磋商，有时还会争吵。

在两天对话的前夕，人权组织呼吁美国特别要表达对中国人权记录的关注，这对北京来说是非常敏感的话题。

纽约的人权观察说，美国应该让中国对某些领域的人权记录“缺乏进展”承担责任，比如它对政府批评人士的处理，限制言论自由，以及在少数民族地区的政策等。

由美国高层议员组成的一个两党组织也呼吁美国就范围广泛的经济问题向中国施压，包括保护知识产权，确保中国向外国竞争对手进一步开放市场等。

**US Urged to Get Tough With China During Annual Talks**

Human rights groups and lawmakers are urging the Obama administration to take a tough stance Wednesday during annual high-level talks with Chinese officials in Washington.

Secretary of State John Kerry and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew are heading the U.S. delegation at the Strategic and Economic Dialogue. The Chinese side is represented by State Councilor Yang Jiechi and Vice Premier Wang Yang.

The dialogue, now in its fifth year, is a regular opportunity for Washington and Beijing to discuss, and sometimes square off on, issues of both cooperation and disagreement between the world's two largest economies.

Ahead of the two-day talks, there were calls for the U.S. to prominently raise concerns about China's human rights record - a particularly sensitive topic for Beijing.

New York-based Human Rights Watch says the U.S. should hold China accountable for what it calls a "lack of progress" on areas, such as its treatment of government critics, restrictions on free speech, and policies in ethnic areas.

A bipartisan group of top U.S. lawmakers also called for the U.S. to press China on a wide range of economic issues, including protecting intellectual property and ensuring that China opens its markets up to further foreign competition.
