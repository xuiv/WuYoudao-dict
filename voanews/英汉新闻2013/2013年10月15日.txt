Bipartisan Deal Could End U.S. Shutdown

A bipartisan accord to reopen the U.S. government and avoid a debt default is taking shape in the Senate, as potential U.S. insolvency looms and the federal shutdown enters a third week.

House and Senate Republicans are expected to meet Tuesday to discuss a potential deal that could end the government shutdown and raise the debt ceiling.

After a day of talks Monday, both Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell expressed optimism that a deal could be reached.

Reid told reporters late Monday that there was "tremendous progress" toward a deal. He cautioned that Congress is "not there yet," but predicted Tuesday could be a "bright day."

McConnell said he shares Reid's optimism.

Any deal would have to be approved by both the House and the Senate before being signed by the president.

73 Killed in Philippines Earthquake

A powerful earthquake struck the central Philippines early Tuesday, killing at least 73 people and wounding hundreds more in a popular tourist region.

The 7.2-magnitude quake was centered near Bohol Island, where authorities say the majority of the casualties occurred.

The quake, and several powerful aftershocks, collapsed buildings, buckled roads, and sent frightened residents rushing out of their homes and businesses.

The death toll is expected to climb as the rescue operation continues on Tuesday.

Pictures on social media showed extensive damage to shops and roads torn apart by the quake. Witnesses say several of the area's historic buildings suffered major damage.
