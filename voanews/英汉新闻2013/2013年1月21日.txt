**奥巴马开始第二个总统任期**

美国总统奥巴马总统将于星期一在国会前面举行的典礼上再次宣誓就任，并将发表就职演讲，此后将参加游行，庆祝他开始第二个总统任期。

预计将有多达80万人聚集在国家大草坪，观看典礼盛况。将近200万人现场观看了美国首位黑人总统奥巴马的第一次宣誓就职，这次人数相对较少。

奥巴马星期天在白宫已经正式宣誓就任总统，因为美国宪法规定，总统必须在1月20号宣誓就职。美国最高法院首席大法官罗伯茨主持了宣誓就职仪式，2009年的总统宣
誓就职仪式也是他主持的。

星期一再次宣誓就职时，奥巴马将使用两本具有历史意义的圣经，一本是19世纪的前总统林肯使用过的圣经，另一本圣经是民权运动领袖马丁•路德•金使用过的。马丁•路德•金于1968年被暗杀。

星期一是纪念马丁•路德•金生日的联邦假日。

** Obama Begins Second Presidential Term**

U.S. President Barack Obama takes the oath of office again Monday at a public
ceremony in front of the Capitol building, where he will also give an address
before taking part in a parade to mark the beginning of his second term.

As many as 800,000 people are expected to crowd the National Mall to witness
the event. That is a smaller number than his first inauguration when nearly
2 million people came to see the swearing-in of the nation's first black
president.

Mr. Obama took the official oath of office Sunday because the U.S. Constitution
mandates the president be sworn in on January 20. Chief Justice John Roberts
administered the oath, just as he did for the president in 2009.

Mr. Obama will retake the oath Monday using two historic Bibles - one owned
by 19th-century president Abraham Lincoln, and the other by civil rights
leader Martin Luther King Jr., who was assassinated in 1968.

Monday's inauguration coincides with the federal holiday marking King's
birthday.

** Suspected North Korean Spy Arrested in South Korea**

South Korean officials say a man who defected from North Korea nearly a
decade ago has been arrested and charged with spying for Pyongyang.

Authorities say the man, who was not identified, had a job with the Seoul
city government supporting North Korean defectors.

He is accused of sending Pyongyang a full list of the defectors living in
Seoul and details concerning their resettlement and living conditions.

Intelligence officials say the man is known to have visited North Korea
via China several times. He defected from the North in 2004 and is believed
to have family living there.
