**中国将派“和平方舟号”海军医院船赴菲律宾救灾**

中国增加了对菲律宾的救灾援助。此前中国受到批评，被认为对受灾邻国帮助不够。中国与菲律宾之间存在领土争端。

中国外交部星期三说，中国政府和中国红十字会分别派出的紧急医疗队和救援队很快将抵达菲律宾。此外，中国还派出了一艘1万4千吨级的海军医院船“和平方舟号”。

台风“海燕”于12天前重创菲律宾中部地区，造成4千多人死亡，数百万人无家可归。到目前为止，还有数十万人没有得到紧急救援。

作为世界第二大经济体的中国，最初只为菲律宾提供10万美元援助。受到国内外批评后，中国政府又为菲律宾提供了价值160万美元的救灾物资。

**China to Send 'Peace Ark' to Help Typhoon-Hit Philippines**

China is increasing its relief aid to the Philippines following criticism that it was not doing enough to help its typhoon-hit neighbor, which is involved in a territorial dispute with Beijing.

The Chinese foreign ministry said Wednesday an emergency medical team from the government and a disaster relief team from the Chinese Red Cross will soon arrive in the Philippines. A 14,000-ton navy hospital ship, described as a "peace ark," will also be sent.

It has been 12 days since Typhoon Haiyan tore through the central Philippines, leaving over 4,000 people dead and millions displaced. Hundreds of thousands are yet to be reached with emergency aid.

China, which has the world's second largest economy, initially offered $100,000 to Manila. Following both domestic and international criticism, it increased its aid contribution by $1.6 million in supplies.
