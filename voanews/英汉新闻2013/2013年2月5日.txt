**东京: 中国战舰将火控雷达锁定日舰**

日本说，一艘中国战舰上个星期在东中国海域具有争议的岛屿附近将火控雷达锁定一艘日本海上自卫队海军舰艇。

日本防卫厅就1月30日发生的事件向中国提出抗议。在日中长期领土纠纷中，最近的紧张局势不断危险地升级。这次事件是最新的一次。

防卫大臣小野寺星期二说，中国的举动 “非常不正常。” 他说，瞄准日本舰艇的雷达通常用于帮助指引导弹。

尽管没有出现过重大冲突，但是，中国一再派遣政府船只到日本管辖的这些岛屿附近巡逻。分析人士说，巡逻就意味着在这个海域建立实际控制区。

**Chinese Warship Locked Pre-Firing Radar on Japanese Navy: Tokyo**

Japan says a Chinese warship last week locked its pre-firing radar on a Japanese navy boat near a group of disputed islands in the East China Sea.

The Japanese defense ministry has lodged a complaint with China over the January 30 incident, the latest in a series of dangerous escalations in their long-running territorial dispute.

Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera Tuesday called China's move "very abnormal." He said the radar aimed at the Japanese ship is normally used to help guide missiles.

Although there have not been any major clashes, China has repeatedly sent government ships near the Japanese-administered islands. Analysts say the patrols are meant to establish de facto control of the area.

**中国法院判决10名截访人员非法拘禁罪成立**

中国一家法院做出对一些村民有利的判决。这些村民到北京上访，随后被拘禁在中国所谓的“黑监狱”里。

中国官方的新华社说，法院星期二判定10人非法拘禁上访者的罪名成立。这些上访者是从河南省到北京的。法院说，被告于去年4月在北京的两处院落将上访者非法拘禁了几天。

法院判处被告六个月到两年监禁，认定他们侵犯了上访者的人权。法院还命令被告向上访者支付数目不详的赔偿。

人权组织说，中国地方官员经常雇人对到北京上访的人进行截访，以掩盖其侵权行为，上访者经常被迫返回家乡，或不经审判就被拘禁在所谓的“黑监狱”里。

** China Convicts 10 For Illegal Detention of Petitioners**

A Chinese court has ruled in favor of a group of villagers detained in China's so-called "black jails" after traveling to Beijing to lodge complaints with the central government.

The official Xinhua news agency said 10 people were convicted Tuesday of illegally detaining the petitioners, who had traveled to the capital from central Henan province. The court said the defendants "falsely imprisoned" the petitioners for several days in two courtyards in Beijing last April.

It gave them jail sentences ranging from six months to two years, saying they "infringed the personal rights" of the petitioners. It also ordered them to pay an unspecified amount of compensation.

Rights groups say local Chinese officials often hire agents to stop petitioners from airing their grievances in Beijing, in an effort to cover up abuses. The petitioners often are forced to go back home or are detained without trial in extra-legal facilities known as "black jails."
