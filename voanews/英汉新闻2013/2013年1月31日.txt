**中国当局判两名藏人故意杀人，称其教唆自焚**

中国当局判定两名藏人犯有故意杀人罪，指称他们教唆他人以自焚方式抗议中国统治。

中国官方的新华社说，现年40岁的罗让贡求被判处死刑，缓期两年执行。这种判决通常相当于终身监禁。中国西南部四川省阿坝自治州的法院还判处罗让贡求的侄子、现年31岁的罗让才让10年徒刑。

新华社说，罗让贡求和罗让才让这两人煽动和强迫八人自焚。新华社还说，这八人中的三人于2012年自焚身亡，其他五人或自己放弃自焚计划，或被警方制止。

自从2009年以来，将近100名藏人自焚，抗议他们所认为的中国当局对藏区的压制。

**China Convicts 2 Tibetans of 'Inciting' Self-Immolations**

China has convicted two Tibetans of "intentional homicide" for inciting self-immolations in protest of Chinese rule.

The official Xinhua news agency says 40-year-old Lorang Konchok was condemned to death with a two-year reprieve, a sentence that usually amounts to life in prison. The court in southwestern Aba prefecture in Sichuan province also sentenced that his nephew, 31-year-old Lorang Tsering, to 10 years in prison.

Xinhua says the two men "incited and coerced" eight people to self-immolate. It says three of the eight set themselves on fire and died in 2012, while the others "willfully abandoned their plans" or were stopped by police.

Nearly 100 Tibetans have set themselves on fire since 2009 to protest what they see as oppressive Chinese rule of ethnic Tibetan areas of China.

**以色列战机空袭叙利亚 俄罗斯表示关注**

俄罗斯对据称以色列战机在叙利亚境内发动空袭表示关注。

俄罗斯外交部说，如果得到证实，以色列这个空袭就是对一个主权国家的“无端攻击”，是违反联合国宪章的行为。

有关星期三的空袭出现不同的说法，叙利亚当局说，以色列战机轰炸了大马士革附近的一处军事研究设施，导致两人死亡。

据以色列和西方媒体报道，以色列空袭发生在靠近叙利亚和黎巴嫩边界的另一个地点，并说空袭目标是一个为真主党运送导弹部件的车队。真主党是一个以黎巴嫩为基地的什叶派强烈反以色列民兵组织。

真主党星期四发表声明，谴责以色列的空袭行动，并表示完全站在叙利亚一边。

到星期四清晨为止，有关空袭的相互矛盾的报道都不能得到独立消息来源的证实，而且目前还不清楚究竟发生了一起还是两起不同的空袭。以色列历来拒绝承认采取先发制人的军事行动，星期三拒绝发表任何评论。

但近几个星期以色列官员曾经警告说，他们不会容忍叙利亚的任何武器转移到真主党等激进组织。

**Israeli Warplanes Strike inside Syria**

Russia is expressing concern about an alleged airstrike by Israeli warplanes inside Syria.

The Russian Foreign Ministry says such action, if confirmed, amounts to "unprovoked attacks" against a sovereign nation, in violation of the United Nations charter.

Differing accounts of the Wednesday airstrike have emerged, with Syrian authorities saying Israeli jets fired on a military research facility near Damascus, killing two people.

Israeli and Western news media reported an Israeli airstrike at a different location, close to the Syrian-Lebanese border. They say the target was a convoy delivering missile parts to Hezbollah, the strongly anti-Israel Shi'ite militia based in Lebanon.

Hezbollah condemned the attack in a statement Thursday and expresses its "full solidarity" with Syria.

The conflicting reports could not be resolved or independently confirmed by early Thursday and it remains unclear whether one or two separate strikes occurred. Israel routinely declines to acknowledge preemptive military actions and refused all comment Wednesday.

In recent weeks, Israeli officials have warned that they will not tolerate any transfer of Syrian weapons to militants such as Hezbollah.
