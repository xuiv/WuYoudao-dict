**漂流几天的“嘉年华胜利号”游轮乘客上岸回家**

星期四，一艘失去航行能力的游轮在海上漂流五天后，乘客们终于回到阿拉巴马州上岸，踏上回家的旅途。

星期四晚间，一队拖船把这艘运载大约4千名乘客的嘉年华游轮公司的游轮拖进美国濒临墨西哥湾阿拉巴马州的莫比尔港口。

“嘉年华胜利号”游轮上星期四离开德克萨斯州的加尔维斯敦，开始为期四天的航程。但是星期天，游轮机房起火，主要动力来源被切断，使得这艘游轮在距离墨西哥尤卡坦半岛240公里的海面上漂流。

一些乘客报告说，舱房被水淹，走道上污水横流，他们只好睡在甲板上，以避开酷热、发臭的舱房。他们还说，要排长队领取食物和其他用品。

嘉年华游轮公司总裁卡希尔到码头迎接这艘不幸的游轮和乘客们回岸。

美国海岸警卫队和国家交通安全管理局已经对这艘游轮机房起火的原因展开调查。美国国家交通安全管理局发表声明说，由于这艘游轮悬挂巴哈马国旗，所以巴哈马海事局是主要调查机构。

**Cruise Passengers Headed Home After Days Adrift**

The passengers from a crippled cruise ship that docked in Alabama Thursday after five days adrift are finally on dry land and headed home.

The Carnival cruise ship carrying some 4,000 people was towed in by a flotilla of tug boats, arriving late Thursday at the port of Mobile, on the U.S. Gulf Coast.

The Carnival Cruise Lines' Carnival Triumph ship left Galveston, Texas last Thursday for a four-day cruise, but an engine room fire Sunday knocked out the ship's primary power source and left it adrift 240 kilometers off Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.

Some passengers reported flooded rooms and sewage in hallways, and sleeping on the ships' decks to avoid hot and smelly cabins. They also reported that there were long lines for food and other supplies.

Carnival company head Cahill was on the scene to welcome the ill-fated ship and its passengers back to shore.

The U.S. Coast Guard and National Transportation Safety Board have launched an investigation into the cause of the fire in the engine room. The NTSB says in statement that because the vessel is Bahamian-flagged, the Bahamas Maritime Authority is the primary investigating agency.

**'Blade Runner' Pistorius Arrives in Court to Face Murder Charges**

Olympic track-star Oscar Pistorius has arrived in court to face charges of killing his fashion-model girlfriend, in a high-profile murder case that has stunned South Africans.

The 26-year-old South African native used a jacket to shield his face from reporters and did not comment as he was transferred from prison to a court in the capital, Pretoria, early Friday.

He was arrestedThursday after his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp was found shot to death at his home in a gated community in Pretoria.

Police say the 29-year-old magazine model and law school graduate was shot four times by a 9-millimeter pistol registered to Pistorius. They say he is the only suspect in the case.

Regarded as a sports hero and national icon in South Africa, Pistorius made history in the 400 meters last August at the London Olympics when he became the first double-amputee to run at the Olympics.
Pistorius has won multiple gold medals at the international Paralympics。

Pistorius was born without fibula bones and his legs were amputated below the knee when he was just 11 months old. He is known as the "blade runner" using high-tech prosthetics made out of a carbon-fiber compound.
