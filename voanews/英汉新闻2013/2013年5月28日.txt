**澳大利亚称中国黑客窃取其新谍报总部蓝图**

澳大利亚一家电台说， 中国黑客窃取了正在堪培拉修建的一个先进的谍报机构总部的蓝图。

澳大利亚广播公司说， 窃取行为被追踪到中国境内的一个电脑系统。 报道说， 被窃取的建筑蓝图显示有关服务器的地点、安全系统和通讯电缆布局的详细信息。

专家们说，如果此报道被证实的话，这一窃取行为将使中国黑客更容易暗中监视耗资6亿8百万美元修建的澳大利亚安全情报局大楼的活动。

报道没有提及消息来源。不过报道说，有关信息是从对大楼一个合同商的网络攻击中获得的。报道没有说被指称的攻击发生在什么时候。

澳大利亚总理吉拉德在被问到有关报道时说，有关报道“并不准确”，“没有根据”，但是她不愿意进一步评论。

中国外交部发言人洪磊称澳大利亚广播公司的报道“毫无根据”，并表示没有证据证明中国跟被指称的攻击有关联。

**Chinese Hackers Steal Blueprints for New Australian Spy**

An Australian broadcaster says Chinese hackers have stolen the blueprints of a new, state-of-the-art spy agency headquarters being built in Canberra.

The Australian Broadcasting Corporation says the theft was traced to a computer server in China. It says the building plans show detailed information on server locations, security systems and communications cables.

Experts say, if confirmed, the theft will make it easier for Chinese hackers to spy on the activities in the $608 million Australian Security Intelligence Organization building.
The paper, which did not name its sources, says the information was obtained through a cyber attack on a building contractor. It did not say when the alleged attack occurred.

When asked about the report, Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard called the story "inaccurate" and "unsubstantiated," but would not comment further.

Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hong Lei called ABC's report "groundless," insisting there is no evidence to link China to the alleged attack.

**伊朗和印度石油部长将举行会晤**

伊朗石油部长访问印度，争取恢复伊朗向这个南亚大国的原油出口。

伊朗石油部长罗斯塔姆.卡塞米星期一会晤了印度石油部长韦拉帕 莫伊利，双方讨论了解决伊朗石油销售下降的问题，包括伊朗向印度炼油厂提供保险。印度炼油企业说，由于美国和欧盟对伊朗石油实行制裁，它们无法继续为那些加工伊朗原油的厂家提供保证金。

分析人士说，德黑兰的做法不会成为解决保险问题的可行性方案，因为伊朗的保险公司也受到制裁。

西方旨在迫使伊朗取消其核项目的制裁大大减少了伊朗的原油出口，给这个国家造成严重的财政损失。

**India, Iran Oil Ministers Meet**

Iran's oil minister is visiting India in an effort to revive Iran's crude oil sales to the South Asian nation.

Iranian Oil Minister Rostam Qasemi met Monday with his Indian counterpart Veerappa Moily. The two discussed several possible solutions to Iran's dwindling oil sales, including Iran's offer of insurance to Indian refiners that say they cannot continue insurance coverage of plants that process Iranian crude because of U. S. and European Union sanctions on Iranian oil.

Analysts say Tehran's offer would not be a viable solution to insurance problem because Iranian insurance companies are also under sanctions.

The Western sanctions, aimed at forcing Iran to curb its nuclear program, have greatly reduced Iran's crude oil exports, costing the country billions of dollars in revenue.
