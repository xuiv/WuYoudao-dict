US, Japan Criticize China Air Defense Zone

Japan's defense chief says Tokyo is working closely with Washington following China's establishment of an air defense zone over disputed waters in the East China Sea.

The U.S. and Japan have vowed not to recognize the air defense identification zone, under which Beijing wants all civilian and military aircraft to identify themselves and obey its orders.

Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera said Tuesday the Japanese Self Defense Forces are working with U.S. forces and will take all necessary steps to protect Japanese territory.
While U.S. and Japanese officials have condemned the Chinese move, they stressed it will have no effect on how they work in the area.

Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Tuesday that Japanese commercial flights will "continue to operate under our conventional guidelines."

A Pentagon spokesman, Steve Warren, said a day earlier that U.S. military planes flying in the region would not identify themselves according to the new Chinese rules.

**奥巴马为伊朗核协议辩护**

美国总统奥巴马为世界六强国与伊朗达成的核项目协议进行辩护，认为签订这项协议对安全而言是“正确之举”。

以色列总理内塔尼亚胡近日内将派遣一个国家安全工作组到华盛顿，就永久解决伊朗核问题分歧与奥巴马政府进行磋商。

Obama Defends Iran Nuclear Deal

U.S. President Barack Obama has defended the nuclear deal world powers struck with Iran, saying it is the "right thing" for security.

Israeli officials and some members of Congress have criticized the agreement, saying it allows Iran to keep too much of its nuclear program intact while offering too much in sanctions relief.

Mr. Obama said late Monday in Los Angeles that even after the agreement, all options remain on the table for ensuring that Iran does not possess a nuclear weapon.

Earlier in San Francisco, the president hailed the pact as the first time progress on Iran's nuclear program has been halted in a decade, and stressed the need for continuing diplomatic efforts and not committing to "an endless cycle of conflict."

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is sending a national security team to Washington in the coming days to consult with the Obama administration on a permanent resolution to the Iranian nuclear dispute.
