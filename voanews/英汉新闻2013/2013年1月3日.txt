**印度强奸案嫌疑人被起诉**

印度警方对上月轮奸一名23岁女子的6名嫌疑人正式提出起诉。这名女子后来因伤势过重而死亡。

这些嫌疑人被控绑架、强奸和谋杀等罪名，有关当局说，如果罪名成立，将要对这些嫌疑人判处死刑。由于在印度，不能以谋杀罪起诉未成年人，因此其中一名嫌疑人接受了检查，以确定他的年龄。

预计，印度政府将为这些嫌疑人指定辩护律师，此前印度律师协会表示不为这些被告辩护。

上星期六，那名未透露姓名的女子死于严重内伤，攻击她的袭击者12月16号在一辆公交车里用一根金属棒殴打她。

**India Rape Suspects Face Charges**

Police in India are set to formally charge six suspects in last month's gang rape of a 23-year-old woman who later died from her injuries.

The suspects are facing charges of kidnapping, rape and murder, and authorities say they will push for the death penalty if the men are convicted. One of the suspects has undergone testing to determine his age because juveniles in India cannot be charged with murder.

The government is expected to appoint attorneys to defend the men after bar association lawyers said they would not take part in the defense.

The unidentified woman died Saturday from severe internal injuries that her assailants caused with a metal rod during the attack on a bus December 16.

**Drone Strike Kills A Pakistani Militant Commander**

Pakistani security officials say U.S. drone strikes in tribal regions bordering Afghanistan have killed at least eight people, including Maulvi Nazir, a top militant commander in South Warziristan.

Officials said Thursday that Nazir, who was also known as Mullah Nazir, was one of several suspected militants killed during a strike in the village of Angoor Adda, late Wednesday.

They say at least one one drone attack occurred in North Waziristan. Pakistani news says three people were killed.

Nazir was the main militant commander in South Waziristan. His fighters reportedly have been more interested in attacking U.S.-led troops in Afghanistan than Pakistan's security forces. His faction is said to be allied with other al-Qaida-linked militant groups.
