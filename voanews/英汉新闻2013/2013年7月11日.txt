**拜登：中国必须停止公然窃取美国商业秘密**

美国副总统乔•拜登语气强硬地要求中国停止网络盗窃。美中这两个世界大国于华盛顿召开为期两天的年度对话，拜登致辞。

拜登副总统在星期三的致辞中说，中国必须停止“公然”地窃取知识产权。最近的报道说，中国的这种做法导致美国每年损失数千亿美元。
.
这一内阁级别的对话给华盛顿和北京提供了一个机会，定期就合作与分歧进行磋商，有时还会争吵。

几个星期之前，美国总统奥巴马做为东道主，和中国国家主席习近平在加利福尼亚州举行了非正式首脑会晤。两位领导人的那次会晤基本展现友好的氛围。

拜登的讲话则更加切合实际，既强调了两国在一些领域存在共同利益，但是也没有忽略一些敏感话题，比如美国对中国人权记录的关注和经济改革等。

Biden: China Must Stop 'Outright' Theft of US Trade Secrets

U.S. Vice President Joe Biden made a forceful call for China to stop cyber theft, as he opened two days of annual talks between the two world powers in Washington.

In his opening remarks Wednesday, Biden said China must end the "outright" theft of intellectual property, which recent reports say has cost the U.S. hundreds of billions of dollars a year.

The cabinet-level talks are a regular opportunity for Washington and Beijing to discuss, and sometimes square off on, issues of both cooperation and disagreement.

The dialogue comes weeks after U.S. President Barack Obama hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping for an informal summit in California, where both leaders struck a largely friendly tone.

Biden's speech was more matter-of-fact, stressing areas of common interest, but not ignoring sensitive topics such as U.S. concerns about China's human rights record and economic reforms.


**平板电脑市场扩大，个人电脑世界发货量减少**

一家技术研究机构说，全球范围个人电脑销售继续下降，而平板电脑取代个人电脑，成为许多人的主要电脑装置。

美国高德纳咨询公司说，2013年第二季度的全球个人电脑出货量同比下降百分之11。该公司说，这已是个人电脑出货量连续第五个季度下滑，也是个人电脑市场历史上出货量持续下降历时最长的一次。

报告说，全球消费者正转而购买价格较为便宜的平板电脑；而在新兴市场的国家和地区，价格昂贵的平板电脑已经成为许多人的首选电脑装置。

苹果公司2010年推出iPad之后，平板电脑开始受到人们的喜爱。此后，各制造商纷纷推出价格更低的平板电脑，使其价格一路下跌。

Worldwide PC Shipments Decline as Tablet Market Expands

A technology research group says worldwide shipments of personal computers continue to decline as tablets replace the PC as many people's primary computing device.

The U.S.-based Gartner group says worldwide PC shipments dropped nearly 11 percent in the second quarter of 2013 from the same period last year. It said this is the fifth straight quarter of declining shipments - the longest in the PC market's history.

The report said that consumers worldwide are instead purchasing more affordable tablet devices. In emerging markets, it said inexpensive tablets have now become the first computing device for many.

The devices became popular following the release of Apple's iPad in 2010. Tablet prices have since tumbled, amid heated competition from manufacturers who have flooded the market with cheaper alternatives.
