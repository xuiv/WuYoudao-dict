UN: Syria 'Deteriorating Rapidly'

United Nations human rights investigators say the situation in Syria is "deteriorating rapidly," and that both government troops and rebels opposed to President Bashar al-Assad have committed war crimes.

In their latest report to the U.N. Human Rights Council, the investigators said fighting in Syria has escalated since July, with the conflict becoming more sectarian, radicalized and militarized.

They said abuses by rebels were not on the same scale as those by government troops, but that both sides were found to have used child fighters.

The report also calls on the international community to curb the supply of weapons gong into Syria with consideration for how the arms might affect the wider region.

It recommends a political solution to the two-year crisis, saying there is "no alternative."

In Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Monday the situation in Syria is "not getting any better."

He met with Syrian opposition leaders who are not a part of the main opposition Syrian National Coalition, and stressed his country's position that any solution to the Syrian crisis must come from within Syria.


**印度轮奸案一被告狱中自缢身亡**

印度警方说，被控在新德里轮奸一名女学生的男被告之一在监狱中自杀。

蒂哈尔监狱的一名官员说，拉姆•辛格星期一上午用自己的衣服自缢身亡。印度内政部长苏希尔•库马尔•欣德对记者说，轮奸犯可能自杀事件反映了监狱存在严重的安全漏洞，当局正在就这一事件进行调查。

辛格的父母和律师坚持认为，辛格在监狱中被谋杀，他的一只手上有旧伤，无法自缢。

辛格的父亲说，辛格曾经告诉他，其他犯人对辛格进行鸡奸，并屡次威胁他的生命。

去年12月，一名23岁的女学生在一辆公交车中被轮奸和用铁棍施虐两个多小时，当时驾驶那辆公交车的就是辛格。这名女学生受到非常严重的内伤，两星期后死亡。

当局指控辛格是涉案的五名男子和一名未成年人的团伙头目。上个月，一个特别快速法庭开始审讯五名成年被告，对那名未成年被告的审讯从上星期开始。

Police: India Gang Rape Suspect Kills Himself

Indian police say one of the men accused in the gang rape of a female student on a New Delhi bus has committed suicide in jail.

An official at Tihar jail says Ram Singh hanged himself with his own clothes Monday morning. Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde told reporters that the alleged suicide was a major lapse in security and that authorities were investigating its circumstances.

Singh's parents and lawyer insist Singh was murdered in prison, and that an old hand injury made him incapable of hanging himself.

Singh's father said his son told him that he had been sodomized by other inmates who had repeatedly threatened his life.

Singh was accused of driving the bus on which a 23-year-old student was raped and assault with an iron rod for more than two hours in December. Her internal injuries were so severe that she died two weeks later.

Authorities accused Singh of being the leader of the gang of five men and a juvenile. The trial of the five adult men began in a special fast-track court last month, while the juvenile's trial began last week.
