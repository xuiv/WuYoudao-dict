**Kerry Arrives In Saudi Arabia After Releasing Aid to Egypt**

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has arrived in Saudi Arabia's capital, Riyadh, after a stop in Cairo where he pledged renewed financial assistance to Egypt.

During a meeting with Egypt's President Mohamed Morsi on Sunday, Kerry said the U.S. will provide $190 million immediately as part of a larger $450 million assistance package to spur crucial economic reforms. He also said Washington will give an additional $60 million for a new enterprise fund to support Egyptian entrepreneurs and young people.

For his part, Mr. Morsi gave assurances that Cairo will implement political and economic reforms to help stabilize his bitterly divided country.

Mr. Morsi also promised to finalize an agreement with the International Monetary Fund on a $4.8 billion loan package that has languished for months. Egypt's finance minister said he expects a deal to be reached with the IMF before parliamentary elections in April.

Cairo's central Tahrir Square became turbulent again Sunday evening as protesters demanding reforms clashed with security forces and set fire to at least two cars. Protesters also clashed with security in the troubled city of Port Said. Military officials say one policeman was killed in the clashes and dozens of people were injured.

**卡拉奇为爆炸事件45名死难者举行哀悼**

巴基斯坦最大城市卡拉奇星期一为一座清真寺外汽车炸弹事件的45名遇难者举行哀悼，这起爆炸还造成大约150人受伤。

警方说，星期天的爆炸事件发生在一个什叶派穆斯林占人口多数的居民区。事发时，在清真寺做晚间祈祷的人们正在走出清真寺。周围几栋楼房起火，人们困在倒塌的建筑里。受伤的人当中包括妇女和儿童。

一名准军事官员艾哈迈德表示，爆炸中使用的某种化学物在爆炸时起火，造成了更大的破坏。

到目前为止，还没有人出面对这一事件承担责任，不过，与基地组织有关连的逊尼派激进分子和塔利班经常在巴基斯坦各地袭击什叶派穆斯林，尤其是在卡拉奇。

独立的巴基斯坦人权理事会说，去年卡拉奇有至少2284人死于族裔、宗派以及政治暴力行动。

**Karachi Mourns 45 Killed in Blast**

Pakistan's largest city, Karachi, shut down Monday to mourn the 45 people killed in a car bomb explosion outside a mosque that also wounded about 150 others.

Police say the bomb exploded Sunday as worshippers were leaving evening prayers in a neighborhood dominated by minority Shi'ite Muslims. Several buildings caught fire and people were trapped under the rubble of structures that collapsed. Women and children are among those wounded.

Paramilitary officer Pervez Ahmad says a chemical used in the blast caught fire and spread the destruction.

No one has claimed responsibility, but Sunni Muslim militants with links to al-Qaida and the Taliban frequently target their Shi'ite neighbors across Pakistan, especially in Karachi.

According to the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, at least 2,284 people died in ethnic, sectarian and political violence last year in Karachi.
