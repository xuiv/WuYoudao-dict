**安倍： 中国学校灌输反日情绪**

日本首相安倍晋三指责中国利用国家控制的学校系统灌输反日情绪，加剧两国的领土纠纷。

安倍在访问美国前夕接受华盛顿邮报采访的时候说，中国有同日本以及其他邻国发生冲突的根深蒂固的需要。他说，中国当局利用领土纠纷来维持国内的有力支持，由于这个因素，两国间的分歧不可能在短期内解决。

预计安倍星期五会晤美国总统奥巴马时，会寻求扩大同美国的安保合作，共同对付中国的领土要求带来的威胁。

近年来，日中关系因为关于东中国海一些岛屿的主权纠纷加剧而陷入低谷。这些岛屿附近有具有战略意义的渔场，还可能蕴藏着丰富的石油资源。两国都对这些岛屿提出主权要求 。

日本去年从私人岛主手中购买了其中的一些无人居住小岛，引起中国的正式抗议和中国各地连续数日的反日示威。日本把这些岛屿称为尖阁列岛，中国称之为钓鱼岛。

Japan's Abe: China Schools Teach Anti-Japan Sentiment

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is accusing China of using its state-run school system to encourage anti-Japan sentiment, thereby worsening the two countries' territorial disputes.

On the eve of his visit to Washington, Prime Minister Abe said, in an interview with the Washington Post, that China has a "deeply ingrained" need for conflict with Japan and its other neighbors. He says Beijing uses the disputes to maintain strong domestic support. Because of this, he says it is not likely the differences will be resolved anytime soon.

During his meeting Friday with President Barack Obama, Mr. Abe is expected to seek expanded defense cooperation with Washington to help counter perceived threats from China's territorial claims.

Japan-China ties have sunk to their lowest level in years because of a worsening dispute about a group of remote East China Sea islands that lie near strategic fishing grounds and potential oil deposits. Both countries claim the islands.

Japan purchased some of the uninhabited islands from their private Japanese landowner late last year, prompting official condemnation from Beijing and days of violent anti-Japan protests throughout China.

**美国和韩国将举行年度联合军事演习**

美国和韩国宣布了将于下月举行大规模联合军事演习的计划。几星期前，朝鲜最近一次核试验使地区紧张局势加剧。

美韩联军指挥部星期四发表声明说，为期一个月的年度军事演习将从3月1号开始，这次演习的代号为“雏鹰”，包括一系列海陆空演习。此外，美韩联军指挥部还宣布，将从3月11号开始进行一次为期两星期的电脑模拟演习，代号为“关键决断”。

美韩联军指挥部的声明说，举行演习的目的是加强韩国的安全和战备，并表示演习属于威慑性质。朝鲜将美韩联合军演看做为入侵朝鲜而做的准备。

平壤最近采取步骤以展示本国军力。2月12号，朝鲜进行了第三次、也是当量最大的一次核试验。去年12月，朝鲜成功地将一颗卫星送入太空，批评人士认为这是一次伪装的弹道导弹试验。

Amid Tensions, US, S.Korea to Hold Annual Military Drills

The United States and South Korea have announced plans for large-scale joint military exercises next month, just weeks after North Korea's latest nuclear test raised regional tensions.

A statement issued by the Combined Forces Command on Thursday says the annual war drills will begin on March 1st with a month-long series of air, ground and naval exercises known as Foal Eagle. Separately, it announced a two-week, computer-based simulation called Key Resolve, which will begin on March 11th.

The allies' statement says the exercises are designed to enhance the security and readiness of South Korea and insists they are deterrent in nature. The North sees the drills as preparation to invade its territory.

Pyongyang has recently taken steps to demonstrate its own military power. It conducted its third and most powerful nuclear test yet on February 12th. In December, it successfully launched a satellite into space, in a move critics say was a disguised ballistic missile test.
