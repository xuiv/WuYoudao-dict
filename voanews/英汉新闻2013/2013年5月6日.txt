**马来西亚长期执政联盟继续执掌政权**

选举官员说，马来西亚的执政联盟在议会选举中赢得简单多数胜利，在跟力量加强的反对派联盟展开一场激烈的对决后，终于得以再次延续已历时56年的执政。

星期天选举的最后点票结果显示，总理纳吉布的国民阵线赢得马来西亚222个议会议席中的133个，反对派领导人安华的三党联盟赢得了89个议席。结果显示，执政联盟的得票数下降了几个席位，反对派获得的席位比2008年的选举有所增加。

星期天投票站关闭后几个小时，反对派领导人安华在推特上发布信息说，在选举官员就“舞弊指称”作出解释之前，他的联盟不接受选举结果。他没有说明细节。现在还不清楚正式上诉可能对选举结果产生何种影响。

1000多万人参加了投票，创下破纪录的80%投票率。

反对派的竞选把重点放在对执政联盟的批评指称上。反对派联盟指称马来西亚政府狂妄、滥用公共资金、并对人数众多的华裔人口实行种族歧视。

**Malaysia's Long-Ruling Coalition Retains Power**

Election officials say Malaysia's ruling coalition has won a simple majority in parliamentary polls, extending its 56-year rule after a tough fight with a strengthened opposition alliance.

Final results from Sunday's election show Prime Minister Najib Razak's National Front coalition capturing 133 of Malaysia's 222 legislative seats, and 89 for the opposition's three-party alliance. The results show a decrease of several seats for the ruling coalition, and an increase for the opposition compared to the 2008 election.

Hours after the polls closed on Sunday, opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, in a message posted on Twitter, said his coalition will not accept the results until elections officials explain "alleged instances of fraud." He did not offer details, and it was not clear what effect formal appeals might have on the outcome.

More than 10 million people cast ballots for a record turnout of about 80 percent.

The opposition campaign centered on allegations of ruling party arrogance, abuse of public funds and racial discrimination by the government against the country's sizeable ethnic Chinese population.

**10 Dead in Bangladesh Anti-Blasphemy Protests **
Overnight clashes between crowds of protesters and police in the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka have left at least 10 people dead and hundreds injured.

Police said protesters demanding new anti-blasphemy laws began pelting police with stones late Sunday, and officers responded with rubber bullets. Local media said at least 15 crude bombs exploded near the ruling Awami League's headquarters.

Video showed blazes raging in the night sky with burned shops and dozens of vehicles set on fire as tens of thousands of protesters raged in the streets. Many of Dhaka's roads were blocked.

Officials say the protesters dispersed early Monday.

Protester demands from the newly formed Hifazat-e-Islam group come in response to what hardliners say is a group of local "atheist" Internet bloggers the protesters accuse of insulting Islam.

The group has authored a 13-point list of demands, including an end to what it calls "the godless education system," and new laws prohibiting the unrestrained public mixing of men and women. It also wants a ban on the construction of monuments and statues in the country, and a curtailment of women's rights.
