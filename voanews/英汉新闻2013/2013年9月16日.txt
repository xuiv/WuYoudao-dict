**联合国：证据显示有人在叙利亚动用化武**


联合国检查人员说，有明确和令人信服的证据显示上个月有人在叙利亚的一场较大规模的攻击行动中使用了化学武器。那次攻击造成数百人死亡。

媒体报道说，联合国检查人员说，他们收集到的环境、化学和医学样品显示，有人8月21日在大马士革的(Ghouta)戈塔地区使用了装有沙林神经毒气的地对地火箭。

调查员的任务是证实曾经发生过化武攻击，而不是确认使用化武的肇事者。

美国认为，叙利亚政府军动用了化学武器，造成1400多人死亡。 叙利亚则表示，责任在反政府武装而不是政府军。


UN: 'Convincing Evidence' of Syria Chemical Attack


United Nations inspectors say there is "clear and convincing evidence" that chemical weapons were used on a relatively large scale in an attack last month in Syria that killed hundreds of people.

News agencies are reporting the inspectors said collected environmental, chemical and medical samples show "that surface-to-surface rockets containing the nerve agent sarin were used in the Ghouta area of Damascus'' on August 21.

The inspectors were charged with determining if chemical weapons were used and not who unleashed them. The U.S. says Syrian forces were behind the attack which Washington says killed more than 1,400 last month.

Syria says it was rebel fighters, not government forces, who are responsible.


**谁将接任美联储主席：现在一切都是未知数**

下任美国联邦储备委员会主席的主要人选萨默斯退出后，奥巴马总统将会任命谁替接伯南克成为一个悬而未决的问题。

劳伦斯·萨默斯是奥巴马总统任期最初几年的主要经济顾问之一，他在周日请求把自己撤出下任美联储主席的考虑人选。美联储是美国重要的货币政策机构，也是世界经济体中的重要环节。

萨默斯的退出可能使现任美联储副主席珍妮特·耶伦成为美联储第一位女性主席，但其他重要的经济人物也有可能被提名。

重要的美国经济学家、高频经济公司的奥沙利文在接受美国之音采访时说，耶伦很有可能被提名，如果她担任美联储主席，会领导美联储继续支持美国经济复苏。

萨默斯曾任哈佛大学校长，华盛顿官员曾经认为他会是奥巴马总统提名接替伯南克的首要人选，伯南克的任期在明年1月结束。但是多名民主党参议员曾表示不支持萨默斯担任美联储主席，并对白宫说他对金融界的监管过于放松。

New US Central Bank Chief Now an Open Question


The withdrawal of the leading candidate to head the U.S. central bank leaves it an open question who President Barack Obama might name to succeed outgoing Chairman Ben Bernanke.

A key White House economic adviser in the early years of Mr. Obama's presidency, Lawrence Summers, withdrew his name Sunday from consideration to lead the Federal Reserve, the country's key monetary policy agency and an important link in the world economy.

His withdrawal could lead to the appointment of the first woman chairman of the Fed, Janet Yellen, currently the central bank's vice chairman. But other economic leaders could also be named.

One leading U.S. economist, Jim O'Sullivan of High Frequency Economics, told VOA Yellen is the likely choice and would lead to a continuation of Fed support for the American economic recovery.

Washington officials believed Summers, a former Harvard University president, was Mr. Obama's first choice to replace Bernanke, when his term expires in January. But several Democratic senators had voiced opposition to Summers' possible appointment, telling the White House that he was too lax on financial regulation.
