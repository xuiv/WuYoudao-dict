**Partial Results Expected Thursday in Zimbabwe Election**

Zimbabwean election officials say they expect to announce partial results Thursday from an election they are calling "free and fair."

Both President Robert Mugabe and Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai have expressed confidence they will win Wednesday's presidential vote. Mr. Tsvangirai's MDC party has accused Mr. Mugabe of rigging the vote, which the president denies.
Rita Makarau, chairwoman of the Zimbabwe Election Commission, says votes are being counted and she believes the election was fair. The election authority has until next Monday to release full results.

Police in Zimbabwe have warned they will arrest anyone who gives unofficial vote tallies.

In the past, vote monitoring groups in Zimbabwe have issued independent tallies based on results from polling stations after preliminary counts. But late Wednesday, police vowed a crackdown that extends to the online publication of any results issued before the country's electoral commission does so.
