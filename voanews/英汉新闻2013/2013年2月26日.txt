**叙利亚反对派承诺出席罗马峰会**

叙利亚反对派领导人表示，将出席本星期在意大利首都罗马举行的国际会议。叙利亚反对派曾因认为其他国家在制止叙利亚暴力方面行动不力，一度考虑抵制此次会议。

叙利亚全国联盟主席哈提卜星期一晚间在他的脸书网页上发表声明说，和他站在同一路线的反对派领导人已经决定不抵制定于星期四召开的“叙利亚之友”国际会议。

美国副总统拜登对这一决定表示欢迎，并说这次会议是叙利亚反对派表达对目前危机看法的一个重要机会。拜登星期一在电话中对哈提卜说，这次会议还将讨论如何援助叙利亚反对派和叙利亚人民。

白宫说，美国国务卿克里将会晤叙利亚反对派成员。

星期一，克里在伦敦会晤英国首相卡梅伦和英国外交大臣黑格后说，叙利亚持续的暴力表明阿萨德总统必须下台。克里同时以最强烈的措辞谴责滥杀无辜行为。

英国外交大臣黑格呼吁国际给予叙利亚反对派更多支持。他说，在暴力面前，“我们的政策不能一成不变”。黑格表示，今后几星期内，英国将努力促成支持叙利亚全国联盟的新援助方案。

星期一，叙利亚外长瓦利德•穆阿利姆在俄罗斯首都莫斯科表示，叙利亚政府愿意同有意愿参加的各方进行对话。


** Syrian Opposition Pledges to Attend Rome Summit**

Syrian opposition leaders say they will attend an international conference in Rome this week, after considering a boycott because of what they deemed a lack of action by other nations to end the violence in Syria.

In a statement on his Facebook page late Monday, Syrian National Coalition head Ahmed al-Khatib said his fellow opposition leaders had decided to stop their suspension of any visit to the Friends of Syria conference set for Thursday.

U.S. Vice President Joe Biden welcomed the decision, saying the meeting is an important opportunity for the opposition to share its view of the crisis. He told Khatib during a telephone call Monday that the conference will also be a way to discuss how to aid the opposition and the Syrian people.

The White House says new U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry will also meet with opposition members.

Kerry said Monday after talks in London with British Prime Minister David Cameron and Foreign Secretary William Hague that the continued violence in Syria is evidence that President Bashar al-Assad needs to leave office. He also condemned what he called the "indiscriminate killing" in "the strongest terms."

British Foreign Secretary Hague called for increased support for Syria's opposition, saying that "our policy cannot be static" in the face of the violence. Hague said that in the coming weeks Britain would be pushing for a new package of assistance to support the Syrian National Coalition.

In Moscow, Syria's Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem said that the Syrian government is open to dialogue with those who want to take part.

** Hot Air Balloon Crash Kills 19 in Egypt**

A hot air balloon has crashed near the Egyptian city of Luxor, killing 19 tourists on board.

Two other people, including the pilot, survived after the balloon caught fire and exploded Tuesday while traveling at an altitude of 300 meters over the west bank of the Nile River.

Officials said the dead included people from France, Britain and other countries.

The area where the balloon went down was a capital of ancient Egypt, and draws tourists to see temples, palaces and tombs, including the burial site of the pharaoh Tutankhamun. The United Nations cultural agency UNESCO designated it a World Heritage site in 1979.
