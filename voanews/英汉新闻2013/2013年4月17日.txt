**FBI怀疑波士顿爆炸案的炸弹或为高压锅制成**

美国联邦调查局说，在星期一波士顿马拉松赛中爆炸的两枚炸弹是藏在一个深色包里，炸弹可能是用藏有钉子和滚珠的高压锅制成。

联邦调查局人员正在检查在爆炸现场找到的碎片，希望能汇集线索，以判断袭击发生时的情况。

有关当局目前还没有发现任何嫌疑人，要求公众送交在马拉松赛沿途拍摄的任何照片和录像，协助查找肇事者。

美国之音记者普雷苏蒂在波士顿报道说，警方还要求民众提供任何可能的线索。

波士顿警方和消防队员工会悬赏5万美元，寻求有助于抓获肇事者的信息。

负责这一案件的联邦调查局特工说，调查人员即使“走遍天涯海角”，也要找到这起爆炸案的制造者。

马里兰州国会议员鲁斯伯格星期二在听完一个安全简报会后说，由于案发前没有有关情报，目前看来不大可能是基地组织或其他外国政府介入了这起爆炸案。

几秒钟内在波士顿马拉松赛终点线上接连发生的两起爆炸造成3人死亡，其中包括一名8岁男孩。 另外有176人受伤，一些人的手臂或腿被炸断。

** FBI Suspects Boston Bombs Packed in Pressure Cookers**

The FBI says the two bombs that exploded Monday at the Boston Marathon were carried in a dark-colored bag, and possibly consisted of pressure cookers packed with nails and ball bearings.

FBI examiners are looking at fragments recovered from the scene, as they try to piece together how the attack happened.

Authorities do not have any suspects, and are asking the public to send in any photos or videos taken along the marathon route to help find who was responsible.

VOA correspondent Carolyn Presutti, reporting in Boston, says police are also asking people to call in any possible tips.

Police and firefighters unions in Boston have offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to an arrest.

The FBI agent in charge of the case says investigators will "go to the ends of the Earth" to identify who carried out the bombings.

Maryland Congressman Dutch Ruppersberger said after a security briefing Tuesday it is not likely that al-Qaida or any foreign government was involved because of the lack of prior intelligence.

Two blasts seconds apart killed three people at the finish line of the Boston Marathon, including an 8-year-old boy. One-hundred-76 people were injured. A number of them lost limbs.

**Britain, World Dignitaries Say Goodbye to 'Iron Lady'**

World leaders and dignitaries from 170 countries will attend the funeral of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher amid heavy security at St. Paul's Cathedral in London Wednesday.

Britain's Queen Elizabeth, her husband Prince Phillip, and Prime Minister David Cameron will lead the more than 2,000 guests expected to attend the service. Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and ex-Vice President Dick Cheney will also attend.

Mrs. Thatcher's body was brought Tuesday to Westminster Palace, to rest overnight before the funeral. Her coffin will be carried in a funeral procession Wednesday morning along a central London route lined by members of the British armed forces.

More than 4,000 police also will be deployed as part of a security operation that was increased following Monday's deadly bomb attacks in Boston. Officials say they are well-prepared to deal with the security for the funeral, as well as the London Marathon on Sunday.

Mrs. Thatcher died from a stroke April 8 at the age of 87. Britain's first and only female prime minister, she became one of the country's most influential modern-day leaders during her time in office from 1979 to 1990.
