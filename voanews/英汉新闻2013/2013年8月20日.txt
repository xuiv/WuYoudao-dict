**埃及当局逮捕穆兄会领袖**

埃及当局逮捕了穆斯林兄弟会精神领袖穆罕默德·巴迪，埃及军方推翻总统穆尔西后，对穆兄会的镇压进一步升级。

星期二凌晨，现年70岁的巴迪被拘留在开罗东部的一个街区，几星期来，支持穆尔西的抗议者一直在那里集会，反对埃及的新临时政府。

巴迪与其他穆兄会领导人将于8月25日受审。埃及当局指控他们6月在穆兄会总部外面煽动致命暴力。穆尔西在暴力发生后几天被军队推翻。

自7月3日穆尔西被赶下台后，埃及各地暴力不断，官方公布的由暴力导致的死亡人数已经超过一千人。穆斯林兄弟会说，死亡人数远远超过官方的数字。

与此同时，埃及当局可能很快就将释放前总统穆巴拉克。2011年，穆巴拉克在民众起义中下台，此后被拘禁了两年多。

一家法院星期一说，不能继续以涉嫌侵吞公款罪名拘押穆巴拉克。在法院下达这项命令后，穆巴拉克只剩下一起罪案。

穆巴拉克的辩护律师说，预计穆巴拉克将于本周末获释。

Egyptian Authorities Arrest Muslim Brotherhood Leader

Egyptian authorities have arrested Muslim Brotherhood spiritual leader Mohammed Badie, escalating a crackdown on the group following the military's ouster of president Mohamed Morsi.

The 70-year-old Badie was taken into custody early Tuesday in a neighborhood of eastern Cairo where for weeks pro-Morsi protesters rallied against Egypt's new interim government.

Badie is due to go on trial August 25 along with other Brotherhood leaders. Authorities accuse them of inciting deadly violence outside the group's headquarters in June, days before the military deposed Mr. Morsi.

Since the July 3 move, the official death toll for violence across Egypt has topped 1,000 people. The Muslim Brotherhood says many more people have died.

Meanwhile, Egyptian authorities may soon free former leader Hosni Mubarak, who has spent more than two years in custody following the 2011 popular revolt that drove him from power.

A court said Monday he could no longer be held on charges that he and his sons stole public money for presidential palaces. With that order, Mr. Mubarak remains in detention in connection with only one other case.

The former president's lawyer said he expected Mr. Mubarak would be released by the end of the week.

**朝鲜对美韩联合军演的批评相对缓和**

朝鲜用比以往和缓的措辞对美韩两国这个星期开始的联合军演做出回应。

美韩“乙支自由卫士”演习在星期一开始。这一年度联合军演通常会受到平壤官员的抨击，朝鲜把它看作是准备入侵。

平壤的朝鲜和平统一委员会星期二提到了这次演习，但是没有对此作出特别的批评。

该机构的声明抨击了韩国总统朴槿惠上星期的言论。她说，尽管最近紧张局势有所缓和，但首尔仍需要保持警觉，“勿忘战争”。

声明没有直接点朴槿惠的名字，但是表示这种言论不利于“对话的气氛”。声明警告说，如果韩国继续“寻求对抗”，将会产生“不可控制的灾难性后果”。

NKorea Offers Softened Criticism to US-SKorean Military Drill

North Korea has responded with softer than usual language to an annual U.S.-South Korea war exercise that began this week.

The Ulchi Freedom Guardian drill that began Monday is regularly slammed by Pyongyang officials, who consider it a preparation for invasion.

The North's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea on Tuesday mentioned the exercise, but did not specifically criticize it.

The statement instead blasted South Korean President Park Geun-hye for saying last week Seoul should remain on guard and "not forget about war," despite a recent reduction in tensions.

Though it did not mention her by name, the statement said Ms. Park's comments "chill the atmosphere for dialogue." It warned of "uncontrollably catastrophic consequences" if the South continues to "pursue confrontation."
