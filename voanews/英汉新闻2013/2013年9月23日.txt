**肯尼亚官员：从遇袭商厦中救出大部分人质**

肯尼亚当局说，只有几名人质还留在内罗毕的商厦中。伊斯兰激进分子上星期六袭击了这个商厦，造成几十人死亡。

索马里恐怖主义组织青年党宣称对袭击事件负责。他们说，这是为了对肯尼亚出兵干预索马里事务进行报复。

肯尼亚军队星期天对西门商厦发起进攻，以救出躲藏在里面的或是被绑架的平民。肯尼亚内务部长伦库星期一在记者会上说，肯尼亚军队已控制了商厦的所有楼层，救出了大部分人质。他说，有两名武装分子被击毙，10名肯尼亚安全部队成员受伤。

伦库在记者会上发表了一个半小时的讲话。之前目击者听到商厦内传出巨大的爆炸声和枪声。爆炸后，商厦里冒出黑烟。伦库说，激进分子点燃了床垫，以分散注意力。他说，星期六袭击开始以来，已有62人死亡。肯尼亚红十字会说，死亡人数为69人，175人受伤，至少65人失踪。

Kenyan Official: Most Hostages Rescued from Mall

Kenya says only a few hostages remain inside the Nairobi shopping mall stormed by Islamist militants Saturday. Dozens of people have been killed in the attack.

The Somali terrorist group al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the assault -- saying it was in retaliation for Kenya's military intervention in Somalia.

Kenyan forces began an assault on the Westgate Mall late Sunday to rescue people hiding from or held captive by the gunmen.

Interior Minister Joseph Ole Lenku told a news conference Monday that Kenyan forces now control every floor of the mall and have rescued most of the remaining hostages.

He said two gunmen had been killed in the ongoing military operation, and 10 members of the security forces wounded.

Lenku spoke about 90 minutes after witnesses heard several large explosions coming from the mall, followed by the sound of gunfire. A column of thick, black smoke continued to rise from the mall after the blasts. Lenku said the militants set mattresses on fire as a distraction.

He said 62 people have been killed since the assault began Saturday. The Kenyan Red Cross put the death toll at 69, with 175 people wounded and at least 65 missing.

**默克尔的保守党联盟在德国选举中获胜**

德国总理默克尔的保守党联盟在星期天的议会选举中获胜，但以微小差距未能获得绝对多数地位。

最终选举结果显示，默克尔所属的基督教民主联盟获得41.5%的选票，距获得议会下院多数地位仅差五个席位。

默克尔很可能不得不与社会民主党结为联盟。社民党获得大约26%的选票。

默克尔更愿意与持自由派立场的自由民主党结盟，但该党只获得4.8%的选票，而取得议席的门槛是至少获得5%的选票。

默克尔对欢呼的支持者说：“这是很棒的结果。我们将为德国竭尽全力，在今后的四年里取得成功。”

Merkel, Conservatives Triumph in German Vote

Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives triumphed in Germany's election Sunday, but finished just short of an absolute majority.

Final results give Ms. Merkel's Christian Democrats 41.5 percent of the vote, finishing only five seats short of an absolute majority in the lower house.

She likely will have to seek a grand coalition with the Social Democrats, who won about 26 percent of the vote.

Ms. Merkel's preferred liberal partners, the Free Democrats, won only 4.8 percent of the vote, falling short of the 5 percent need to win seats in parliament.

"This is a super result," Ms. Merkel told cheering supporters. "We will do everything together in the next four years to make them successful years for Germany."
