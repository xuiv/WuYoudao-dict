**奥巴马：泄密事件显示国安局“重大薄弱环节”**

美国总统奥巴马说，前美国情报合同工斯诺登泄露了政府的秘密监控项目，这显示，秘密的国家安全局存在“相当严重的薄弱环节”。

不过，星期四在塞内加尔举行的记者会上，奥巴马总统说，他无意和外国政府“讨价还价做交易”来保证斯诺登返回美国接受间谍罪审判。

斯诺登泄露了国安局两项高保密的电话和互联网通讯监控项目并逃到香港。他后来飞往俄罗斯。目前他生活在莫斯科一处机场的转机区内，同时寻求厄瓜多尔的庇护。

奥巴马说，他没有为了要求引渡斯诺登而打电话给中国国家主席习近平或俄罗斯总统普京。奥巴马总统说，他“不应该这样做”，引渡要求应通过“正常法律渠道”处理。他说，“这是各国执法官员之间的日常处理的业务。”

普京说，俄罗斯没有把斯诺登引渡给美国的计划。

**Obama: 'Significant Vulnerability' at US Spy Agency**

U.S. President Barack Obama says the disclosure of the government's clandestine surveillance programs by a former intelligence contractor shows that there is a "pretty significant vulnerability" at the secretive National Security Agency.

But at a news conference Thursday in Senegal, the U.S. leader said he has no intention of "wheeling, dealing and trading" with foreign governments to secure the return of Edward Snowden to stand trial on espionage charges.

Snowden fled to Hong Kong and leaked details of two NSA programs that monitor telephone and Internet communications in the United States. Later Snowden flew to Russia, where he is living in a transit zone at a Moscow airport while seeking asylum in Ecuador.

Mr. Obama said he had not called either Chinese President Xi Jinping or Russian President Vladimir Putin to request Snowden's extradition. The president said he "should not have to" and the extradition request should be dealt with through "regular legal channels."

He said, "This is something that routinely is dealt with between law enforcement officials in various countries."

Mr. Putin says Russia does not plan to extradite Snowden to the United States.

星期四，克里会见了约旦国王阿卜杜拉，他还准备到耶路撒冷会见以色列总理内塔尼亚胡。克里将在星期五返回阿曼，和巴勒斯坦领导人阿巴斯举行会谈。

**Kerry in Mideast for Peace Push**

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is shuttling between Amman and Jerusalem, trying to give momentum to stalled peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians.

Speaking in the Jordanian capital Thursday, Kerry said both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas share "a serious commitment of purpose." But he warned both leaders will be tested by those who do not want peace talks to succeed.

Kerry spent part of Thursday meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah. He is also set to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem. On Friday, he returns to Amman to meet with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.
