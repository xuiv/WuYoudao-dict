**南非继续听证皮斯托利斯枪杀案**

南非检方人员要求以谋杀罪判处奥运径赛选手皮斯托利斯，检方说一名证人在被告开枪打死他的女友斯廷坎普的那天早晨听到持续一小时的争吵声。

法庭星期三进行第二天的保释听证。检方人员说，在枪击发生时，斯廷坎普是穿上衣服，并在浴室中将门反锁。检方陈述上星期四清晨枪击事件时说，当时皮斯托利斯装上义肢，走了七公尺穿过卧室，然后向浴室的门开了四枪。

皮斯托利斯坚持说，他以为是在向盗贼开枪，并“无意”杀死自己的女友。皮斯托利斯星期二在法庭提交的宣誓证词说，他“深深爱着”斯廷坎普。

法庭不排除此案预谋杀人的可能性，但以后可能减轻控罪。如果皮斯托利斯的预谋杀人罪名成立，可能被判处终身监禁。

星期二听证举行期间，斯廷坎普的家人在伊丽莎白港为这位模特举行了私下的葬礼。

在南非，皮斯托利斯被视为体育英雄和全国偶像。他去年8月创造了历史，成为第一位参加奥运跑步比赛的双腿截肢选手。

**Pistorius Hearing Continues**

South African prosecutors pursuing a murder case against Olympic runner Oscar Pistorius say a witness overheard an hour of non-stop fighting on the morning he fatally shot his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp.

The prosecution said Wednesday during the second day of bail hearings that Steenkamp was dressed and had locked the bathroom door from inside at the time of the shooting. Their account of the events early last Thursday says Pistorius put on his prosthetic legs, walked seven meters across his bedroom and shot four times through the door.

Pistorius insists he thought he was shooting at a burglar and had "no intention" of killing his girlfriend. In an affidavit presented in court Tuesday, he said he was "deeply in love" with Steenkamp.

The magistrate ruled that premeditation cannot be excluded in the case, but that the charge could be downgraded later. Pre-meditated murder carries a possible lifetime prison sentence.

Her family held a private funeral Tuesday in Port Elizabeth, while the hearing was taking place.

Pistorius is regarded as a sports hero and national icon in South Africa. He made history in August when he became the first double amputee to run at the Olympics.

**美国议员代表团在哈瓦那会见卡斯特罗**

古巴主席劳尔•卡斯特罗会见了美国议员代表团。这些美国议员们争取一名美国公民获得释放，这名美国人自2009年以来一直被关押在哈瓦那。

古巴政府发表声明说，卡斯特罗与美国民主党参议员利希率领的美国代表团成员讨论了古美两国共同关心的问题。古巴外交部长罗德里格斯也参加了会谈。

美国国会代表团希望古巴当局释放格罗斯。格罗斯由于持有通讯设备而被逮捕，并被判处15年监禁。当时格罗斯作为美国国务院一个项目的承包人在古巴工作。

利希去年曾率领一个类似的代表团访问古巴，并会见了卡斯特罗和格罗斯。

哈瓦那曾经提出，用释放格罗斯交换上世纪90年代在美国被逮捕的五名古巴间谍，他们正在美国服长期的刑期。但华盛顿方面拒绝这种囚犯的交换。

**Castro, US Lawmakers Meet in Havana**

Cuban President Raul Castro met with a group of U.S. lawmakers seeking the release of an American citizen who has been detained in Havana since 2009.

A statement by the Cuban government says Mr. Castro and the U.S. delegation, led by Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, discussed "issues of interest for both countries." Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez also attended the meeting.

The congressional delegation wants Cuban authorities to free Alan Gross, who was sentenced to 15-years in prison after he was arrested for possessing communications equipment. Gross was in Cuba working as a contractor for a U.S. State Department program.

Leahy led a similar delegation to Cuba last year, where he met with Mr. Castro and Gross.

Havana has offered to release Gross in exchange for five Cuban spies captured in the U.S. in 1990s and serving lengthy jail sentences. But Washington has ruled out any such prisoner swap.
