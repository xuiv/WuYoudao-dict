**日本就岛屿争端召见中国临时代办**

日本召见中国临时代办，抗议中国政府船只在有争议的东海水域附近做不寻常的长时间停留。

日本外务省说，4艘中国船只星期三驶入日本控制的海域，并说在24小时后，这些船只仍未驶离该海域。

日本内阁官房长官菅义伟说，已经召见中国驻日使馆临时代办韩志强，对中国方面的这一举动提出强烈抗议。

持续数十年的中日领土争端于去年激化，此前东京从私人手中购买了几个有争议的岛屿。

自那时以来，北京经常在有争议岛屿附近海域进行空中和海上巡逻，有关人士认为这是北京试图挑战日本对这一具有战略意义的资源丰富海域的控制权。

人们担心这种事态可能导致非有意引发的军事冲突，而且中日两国间的关系已经变得非常紧张。

Japan Summons China Envoy over Island Dispute

Japan has summoned a China envoy to protest an unusually long visit by Chinese government ships near disputed waters in the East China Sea.

Tokyo's foreign ministry says the four ships entered the Japan-controlled territory on Wednesday. It says they had still not left 24 hours later.

Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga says acting ambassador Han Zhiqiang has been summoned to "sharply protest" the move.

The decades-old dispute flared up late last year, after Tokyo purchased some of the contested islands from their private Japanese landowner.

Since then, Beijing has sent regular air and sea patrols near the islands, in what some say is an attempt to challenge Japan's control of the energy-rich, strategic area.

This has led to fears of an unintended military clash and has raised tensions considerably between the two countries.

Morsi Backers Defy Egyptian Leaders, Continue Protests

Thousands of Egyptians supporting ousted President Mohamed Morsi have gathered in Cairo, praying and celebrating Eid al-Fitr at protest camps despite government warnings to vacate the sites.

Opponents of Mr. Morsi also gathered Thursday in Cairo's Tahrir Square, a day after interim President Adly Mansour said efforts by international envoys to bridge Egypt's political divide had failed.

Mr. Mansour blamed Mr. Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood for the failure.

The United States and European Union voiced their concerns, saying the political divide has created a fragile situation that could spark more bloodshed.

In a joint statement late Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said the two sides must break a "dangerous stalemate" and implement "tangible confidence building measures."

The diplomats said Egypt's government bears a special responsibility to begin a reconciliation process.
