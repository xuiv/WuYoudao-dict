**日本在对华争端中增加军费**

日本通过了新的国防开支预算案。军费增加5%。要求自卫武装加大在地区内的作用。

日本政府内阁星期二批准了国家安全战略和防卫大纲，这被看作对中国不断加强的军事力量的反应的一部分。

预算案是应安倍首相的要求起草的。安倍希望修改日本和平主义的宪法，帮助应对包括中国在内的地区性问题。

新的预算案规定，2014年到2019年，日本国防开支将增加百分之5。将用两千四百七十亿美元购买无人侦察机，潜艇，战斗机和两栖车辆。

添置这些武器是日本把军事重心从北方转移到西南方努力的一部分。日本在东中国海上跟中国卷入一场领土争端。

新的国防战略特别提到中国。该方案指出，“中国采取危险行动，可能引发预料外的紧急情况。”该方案还表示，中国的领土要求与国际法相矛盾。

Amid Dispute with China, Japan Boosts Military Spending

Japan has adopted new defense plans calling for a five percent increase in military spending and a greater regional role for its self-defense forces.

The national security strategy and defense guidelines approved by the Cabinet on Tuesday are seen as part of a response to China's growing military power.

The plans were drawn up at the request of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who wants to revise Japan's pacifist constitution to help deal with regional issues, including China.

Under the new plans, defense spending would increase by five percent from 2014 to 2019. Surveillance drones, submarines, fighter jets and amphibious vehicles would be among the purchases, which will total $247 billion.

The hardware is part of a shift in military focus from the north to the southwest, where Japan is involved in a tense dispute with China over islands in the East China Sea.

The security strategy specifically mentioned China, noting it has taken "dangerous action that can draw unexpected contingencies" and saying it has laid claims that are inconsistent with international law.

**中国指责恐怖分子制造新疆致命冲突事件**

中国指责伊斯兰“恐怖团伙”制造流血事件，在新疆发生的该次事件中，有两名警察身亡，另有14人被打死。

当地官员说，星期天的冲突发生在喀什附近，当时警察正试图拘捕嫌疑人。

官方的新华社称这一事件是“有组织，有预谋的暴力恐怖攻击。”并指出拘捕了六个人。

新华社还表示，警方认为，这些嫌疑人是一个拥有20名成员的恐怖组织的一部分。该组织曾试验爆炸物，计划攻击。

新疆曾多次发生致命动乱。北京经常指责外国支持的穆斯林维吾尔分离主义者制造动乱。

流亡国外的维吾尔组织否认这些指控，说中国夸大这些威胁，以便为打压穆斯林的宗教活动找借口。

外国记者很难证实北京和流亡组织的说法。北京严格限制非国有媒体的记者到该地区报道。

China Blames Terrorists for Deadly Clash in Xinjiang

China is blaming an Islamic "terror gang" for an incident during which police shot and killed 14 people in far western Xinjiang province.

Two policemen were also killed in the Sunday clash, which officials say broke out as police tried to arrest suspects near the town of Kashgar.

The official Xinhua news agency called the incident an "organized, pre-meditated, violent terror attack," noting that six people were arrested.

It said police believe the suspects were part of a 20-member terrorist group that had tested explosives and were planning attacks.

Xinjiang has been the scene of numerous incidents of deadly unrest, which Beijing often blames on foreign-backed Muslim Uighur separatists.

Exiled Uighur groups dispute the claim, saying China is exaggerating the threat in order to justify its repression of Muslim religious life.

It is often difficult for foreign journalists to verify the claims made by either side, as Beijing severely restricts all but state-backed reporting in the region.
