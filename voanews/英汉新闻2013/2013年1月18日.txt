**IAEA和伊朗未能就核检查达成协议**

联合国首席核设施检查员的说，在检查伊朗有争议的核项目问题上没有达成协议，不过下个月将举行会议来讨论这个问题。

国际原子能机构核检小组领导人纳卡尔特星期五说，在德黑兰举行两天的密集讨论之后，仍然未能达成进入伊朗核设施的协议。

纳卡尔特说，双方未能就分阶段解决尚待完成的伊朗核问题达成一致。不过，他没有说具体存在什么分歧。他说，下一轮会谈定于2月12日在德黑兰举行。

国际原子能机构本来希望能获准进入伊朗军方的帕尔钦核设施。西方国家怀疑这个设施与研发核武器有关联。伊朗则声称，那里是常规军事设施，而且伊朗的核项目完全是用于和平用途的。

伊朗外交部发言人星期二说，伊朗最高领袖发布的禁止发展核武器的宗教敕令对伊朗政府有约束力。

**IAEA, Iran Fail to Reach Deal on Nuclear Inspections**

The chief United Nations nuclear inspector says no deal has been reached with Iran to investigate that nation's controversial nuclear program, but that a meeting will take place next month on the issue.

International Atomic Energy Agency team leader Herman Nackaerts said Friday that two days of "intensive discussions" in Tehran failed to produce an agreement on access to Iranian nuclear facilities.

Citing unspecified "differences," Nackaerts said the two sides could not agree on a structured approach to resolve outstanding issues. He said another round of talks will take place February 12 in Tehran.

The IAEA had hoped to gain access to the Parchin military site, which Western nations suspect is related to nuclear weapons development. Iran says it is a conventional military site and that its nuclear program is strictly for peaceful purposes.

Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman said Tuesday that a religious decree issued by Iran's supreme leader banning nuclear weapons is binding on the Iranian government.

**阿尔及利亚数十外国人质的命运情况不明**

星期五，发生在阿尔及利亚沙漠一个天然气设施中的人质危机进入了第3天，目前几乎得不到有关还被扣押的外国人质的任何信息。

阿尔及利亚军队星期四突袭阿梅纳斯天然气厂，解救出人数不详的外国和当地工人，但有几名人质和绑架者被打死。

有关国家政府在突袭前没有得到通知，目前正在紧张地努力了解据报被扣押在阿梅纳斯天然气厂的41名外国人质的情况。

至少有4名外国人质已经被他们的本国政府确认安全获救，其中包括3名日本人和一名爱尔兰人。其他的人质据报来自美国、日本、挪威、罗马尼亚、菲律宾、英国、法国、马来西亚和奥地利，目前不清楚他们的命运如何。

**Fates of Dozens of Foreign Hostages in Algeria Unknown**

A hostage crisis at a gas complex in the Algerian desert entered its third day Friday, with little known about the fate of those still held there.

Algerian forces stormed the Ain Amenas gas plant Thursday, freeing an unknown number of foreign and local workers, but leaving several hostages and kidnappers dead.

Foreign governments, which were not alerted to the raid beforehand, were nervously trying to discern the condition of the 41 foreign hostages reported held at the facility.

At least four foreign captives were confirmed safe by their governments -- three Japanese and an Irishman. The fate of the others - reported to be from the U.S., Japan, Norway, Romania, Philippines, Britain, France, Malaysia and Austria, is unknown.
