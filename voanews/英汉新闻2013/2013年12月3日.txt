**拜登：美国对中国划设空识区深为关切**

美国副总统拜登说，美国仍然 “深为关切”中国新公布的空识区。他周二在东京会见了日本领导人。

拜登与日本首相安倍晋三一同发表讲话时把东中国海的中国空识区描述为“单方面改变现状的企图”。 他说， 该空识区“加剧了地区紧张局势，并增加了发生意外和误判的风险 ”。

拜登说，他与安倍首相讨论了这个问题，并表示他打算本周晚些时候在北京会见中国领导人时“非常具体而直接地”提出这些问题。

中国上月底设立了其防空识别区，这个空识区与美国的盟友日本也声称拥有主权的岛屿重叠。中国要求所有飞机在通过该区域之前提交飞行计划。

拜登表示，此举突显了中国和日本有必要建立危机管理机制，采取增强信任的措施，以缓解紧张局势。他警告说，“唯一比有意发生的冲突更坏的冲突，是无意发生的冲突。 ”

Biden: US 'Deeply Concerned' at China's Air Defense Zone

Vice President Joe Biden said the United States remains "deeply concerned" at China's newly declared air defense zone, as he met with Japanese leaders in Tokyo on Tuesday.

Speaking alongside Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Biden called the Chinese zone in the East China Sea "an attempt to unilaterally change the status quo." He said it "has raised regional tension and increased the risk of accidents and miscalculations."

Biden said he discussed the issue with Prime Minister Abe, and that he intends to "raise these concerns with great specificity, directly" when he meets with Chinese leaders in Beijing later this week.

China late last month set up its Air Defense Identification Zone, which overlaps with islands also claimed by U.S. ally Japan. It has requested that all airplanes submit flight plans ahead of flying through the zone.

Biden said the move underscores the need for China and Japan to establish crisis management and confidence building measures to lower tensions, warning that the "only conflict that is worse than one that is intended is one that is unintended."
