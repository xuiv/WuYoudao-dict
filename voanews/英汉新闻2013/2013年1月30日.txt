*韩国发射卫星成功**

韩国表示，韩国成功地将一颗卫星送入太空。就在韩国的邻国朝鲜于数星期前将一颗卫星送入轨道后，这是首尔的一个重大胜利。

星期三，韩国太空发射器在位于韩国南部海岸的罗老太空中心发射升空。

韩国教育科学技术部长官李周浩对记者说，这枚火箭成功地将卫星送入轨道，并宣称这项使命“是我国全体人民的胜利”。

韩国先后三次发射火箭，终于成功地将卫星送入轨道。2009年，韩国火箭抵达轨道，但卫星没有进入位置。一年后，韩国火箭在升空两分钟后爆炸。此后还有几次火箭发射计划，但在最后时刻取消。

星期三就在韩国这次发射火箭的一个月前，朝鲜成功地将其所称的一枚气象卫星送入太空。朝鲜的这一举动遭到国际社会的广泛谴责，因为违反了联合国禁止朝鲜进行弹道导弹试验的制裁。

**S.Korea Successfully Launches Satellite**

South Korea says it has successfully launched a satellite into space - a major feat that comes just weeks after its neighbor North Korea did thesame.

The Korea Space Launch Vehicle lifted off Wednesday disappearing into the sky above the Naro Space Center on the country's southern coast.

Science Minister Lee Ju-ho told reporters that the rocket successfully placedthe satellite into orbit, declaring the mission "a success of all our people.

It took three tries for South Korea to successfully carry out the mission. In 2009, a rocket achieved orbit, but the satellite did not deploy. A year later, the rocket exploded just two minutes after liftoff. More recent attempts were called off at the last minute.

Wednesday's launch comes just a month after North Korea successfully sent what it said was a weather satellite into space. The move was widely condemned by the international community as a violation of United Nations sanctions.

**法国军队开进马里叛军最后堡垒**

法国军队已经部署在马里北部城市基达尔。收复加奥和廷巴克图的行动结束后，基达尔成为反政府武装的最后一个重要堡垒。

法国军方官员星期三说，法国军队夜间完成了部署，继续进行一星期来的收复马里北部主要城市的行动。

世俗的图阿雷格反政府武装马里北方图阿雷格运动(MNLA)本星期早些时候说，该组织的战斗人员控制了基达尔。

去年3月政变后，图阿雷格反政府武装分子与伊斯兰激进分子一道夺取马里北部地区。随后双方由于实施伊斯兰法规问题而分裂，伊斯兰激进分子宣称控制了该地区。

星期二，法国和马里军队在廷巴克图和加奥进行挨家挨户的搜查，收缴逃离的伊斯兰激进分子留下的武器和炸药。在加奥，至少五名涉嫌与伊斯兰激进分子合作的人被逮捕。

在廷巴克图的居民抢劫涉嫌与伊斯兰激进分子合作的阿拉伯人和图阿雷格人开的店铺。本星期早些时候，伊斯兰激进分子逃离廷巴克图。

**French Troops Enter Last Mali Rebel Stronghold **

French troops have deployed in the northern Malian city of Kidal, the last major rebel stronghold remaining after operations to retake control in Gaoand Timbuktu.

French military officials said Wednesday the troops deployed overnight, continuing a week-long push to recapture the main cities in northern Mali.

The secular Tuareg rebel group MNLA said, earlier this week, its fighters had taken control of Kidal.

The Tuareg rebels joined with Islamist militants to seize northern Mali following a March coup. The two groups later split in a dispute about Sharia law and the Islamists asserted control of the region.

French and Malian troops searched houses in Timbuktu and Gao on Tuesday, recovering weapons and explosives left by fleeing Islamists. At least five people suspected of collaborating with the militants were detained in Gao.

In Timbuktu, residents looted stores owned by Arabs and Tuaregs suspected of working with the militants, who left earlier this week.
