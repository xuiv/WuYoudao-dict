**中国国资委主任蒋洁敏被免职接受腐败调查**

中国国家媒体说，国有资产监督管理委员会主任蒋洁敏已被免职。几天前，有关当局宣布蒋洁敏在接受腐败调查。

新华社星期二说，蒋洁敏由于涉嫌严重违纪而被免职。在中国，这一指称几乎都意味着腐败行为。

新华社星期日说，蒋洁敏因涉嫌与中石油集团贪腐案有关而受到调查。现年57岁的蒋洁敏曾担任中石油集团董事长。

中国国家主席习近平誓言要严厉打击中共党内大量存在的贪腐现象。到目前为止，广泛宣传的反腐行动主要针对较低级别的官员。

但有迹象表明，中共可能会将反腐矛头对准一些高层官员。上星期有报道说，北京对已经退休的周永康展开腐败调查。直到去年，周永康还是中国高层领导人之一。

**China Fires Regulatory Official Involved in Corruption Probe**

Chinese state media say the Communist Party has fired the head of a commission that regulates state-owned companies, just days after announcing he was being investigated for corruption.

The Xinhua news agency said Tuesday Jiang Jiemin was removed as head of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission for "suspected serious disciplinary violations." In China, the charge almost always refers to corruption.

On Sunday, Xinhua said Jiang was being investigated for alleged graft linked to the state-run China National Petroleum Corp., where the 57-year-old had formerly been a chairman.

President Xi Jinping has pledged to get tough on the widespread corruption within the Communist Party. So far, his widely publicized graft crackdown has netted mostly lower level officials.

There are signs, however, the party could be targeting some within in its senior ranks. Last week, several reports said Beijing has opened a corruption probe into retired politician Zhou Yongkang, who until last year was one of the country's elite leaders.

**美国官员推动对叙利亚实施军事打击**

星期二，美国总统奥巴马的高级外交官和国防官员将在国会参议院的一个委员会作证，奥巴马请求国会授权他在叙利亚采取军事行动。

美国国务卿克里、国防部长哈格尔和参谋长联席会议主席邓普西将军都将在参议院外交委员会作证。
奥巴马表示，他希望在对叙利亚发动军事打击之前获得国会的认可。据称叙利亚当局对平民使用了化学武器。

白宫官员继续举行闭门会议，向议员们介绍有关情况，以便争取他们支持奥巴马总统的计划。

参议员麦凯恩和格雷厄姆说，他们星期一会见奥巴马后受到鼓舞，但表示他们希望对有关计划做出某些改动。麦凯恩说，在援助叙利亚反政府武装的同时，必须削弱叙利亚总统阿萨德的力量。

** US Officials Press Case for Syria Strike**

President Barack Obama's top diplomat and defense officials are set to testify before a Senate panel Tuesday on his request to authorize U.S. military action in Syria.

Secretary of State John Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey are all due to appear before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Mr. Obama has said he wants congressional approval before launching a military strike on Syria for allegedly using chemical weapons against civilians.

White House officials are continuing to hold closed-door sessions briefing lawmakers in a bid to rally support for Mr. Obama's plan.

Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham said they were encouraged after meeting with the president on Monday, but that they want to see some changes to the proposal. McCain expressed the need to weaken Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's capabilities while upgrading those of the rebels opposing him.
