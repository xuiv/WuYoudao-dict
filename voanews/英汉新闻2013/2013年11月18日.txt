Indonesia Recalls Ambassador to Australia Amid Spying Claims


Indonesia has recalled its ambassador to Australia after claims that Australian spy agencies tried to listen to phone conversations of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.

Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa said Monday that the envoy is being called back to Jakarta for "consultations" after secret documents leaked by former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden named the president, his wife and senior ministers as targets of the surveillance.

The minister called the situation, "an unfriendly, unbecoming act between strategic partners."

The recall comes amid already heightened diplomatic tensions over claims that the Australian and U.S. embassies in Jakarta were involved in general spying on Indonesia.

Gunmen have killed an Egyptian national security official who was in charge of monitoring the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood.
