**黎巴嫩前财长死于汽车炸弹爆炸**

黎巴嫩官员说，贝鲁特市中心发生一次汽车炸弹爆炸，前财政部长沙塔赫和另外至少三人被炸死。

沙塔赫是逊尼派穆斯林，他是一位受人尊敬的经济学家，并担任前总理哈里里的高级顾问。

这次爆炸发生在政府总部附近，城市上空升起黑色浓烟。录像和社交媒体上的画面显示，受惊的人们逃离事件现场，一些汽车着火，窗户被炸掉。

没有人宣称对这次袭击负责。近来，黎巴嫩的暴力事件增多，这些暴力与叙利亚的血腥内战有关联，这场内战已经蔓延到境外。

沙塔赫一向直言不讳地批评叙利亚总统阿萨德。在这次汽车爆炸的几小时前，沙塔赫在推特上发出最后一条信息，批评黎巴嫩激进组织真主党。真主党在叙利亚内战中支持阿萨德。

** Car Bomb Rocks Beirut, Former Minister Assassinated**

Lebanese officials say a car bombing in central Beirut has killed former Finance Minister Mohamad Chatah and at least three others.

Chatah, a Sunni Muslim, was a respected economist and senior advisor to ex-Prime Minister Saad Hariri.
The explosion, which occurred near government headquarters, left a thick cloud of black smoke rising above the city skyline. Video and social media showed terrified people running from the scene, with cars on fire and windows blown out.

No one has claimed responsibility for the bombing. Lebanon has seen a recent increase in violence related to the bloody Syrian civil war that has spilled over the border.

Chatah was an outspoken critic of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. His last message on Twitter, posted about hours before the car bombing, was critical of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, which has supported President Assad in the country's civil war.

**冲绳岛县知事批准在冲绳设立美军基地**

日本南部冲绳岛的行政长官批准一个美国海军陆战队空军基地重新设在该岛沿岸，这违反了他在竞选中做出的将该基地迁离冲绳岛的承诺。

冲绳岛一名官员星期五证实，冲绳县知事仲井真弘多批准了日本防卫省有关在冲绳岛沿岸设立一个新军事基地的申请。该基地将取代美国海军陆战队的普天间基地，普天间位于冲绳岛人口更密集的一个地区。

日本首相安倍晋三星期三会晤仲井真弘多，说服他批准这一申请。此前安倍晋三提出增加对冲绳岛的财政援助。

普天间位于人口密集的宜野湾市，当地居民抱怨喷气机的噪音太大以及基地周边居民的安全受到影响。东京坚持依照2006年与美国达成的协议，将该基地迁离普天间。
冲绳岛居民一直强烈反对这项协议，要求将美军基地迁离冲绳岛。

**Okinawa Governor Approves Plan to Relocate US Marine Base**

The governor of the southern Japanese island of Okinawa has approved the relocation of a U.S. Marine Corps air station to reclaimed land along the coast, breaking a campaign promise to have it removed from the island.

An Okinawan official confirmed Friday that Governor Hirokazu Nakaima approved the Japanese Defense Ministry's application to reclaim land for a new military base on Okinawa's coast. It would replace the U.S. Marine Corps base in Futenma, a more congested part of Okinawa's main island.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe persuaded Nakaima to approve the move in a meeting Wednesday, after offering increased financial assistance to the island.

Futenma is located in a heavily populated area of Ginowan where residents complain of the noise made by jets and the safety of people living around the facility. Tokyo has insisted on the move as called for in an agreement reached with the United States in 2006.

Okinawa residents have steadfastly opposed the agreement.
