**印度法庭对四名强奸犯进行量刑**

印度检方要求对判定致命轮奸罪名成立的四名男子判处死刑。目前一位法官正在考虑如何对被告量刑。

新德里一位法官星期二裁定四名男子的11项罪名成立，其中包括轮奸和谋杀。去年12月，一名23岁女子在公交车上遭到强奸及铁棒袭击。她的男性随行人也遭到殴打，随后两人都被扔出车外。这名女子后来被送到新加坡的医院治疗，但案发两星期后因伤重而死亡。

这四名男子可能被判绞刑。抗议者本星期聚集在法院外面，要求判处被告死刑。法庭星期二作出有罪判决后，民众发生了肢体冲突。

辩方争取对被告判处终身监禁，指出按照印度法律，死刑只适用于极其特殊的案例。

**Indian Court Weighs Gang-rape Sentence**

Prosecutors in India are calling for the death penalty to be handed down against four men found guilty of a fatal gang rape, as a judge considers their sentences.

A New Delhi judge on Tuesday found all four men guilty on 11 charges including gang rape and murder, after the rape and fatal assault of a 23-year-old woman with an iron bar on a bus last December. Her male companion was also beaten before both were thrown off the bus. The woman died of her injuries in a Singapore hospital, two weeks after the attack.

The men face the possibility of hanging. Protesters have gathered outside the courthouse this week to demand the death penalty, and scuffles broke out after the verdict on Tuesday.

The defense is vying for life imprisonment, noting that Indian law calls for execution only in very exceptional cases.
