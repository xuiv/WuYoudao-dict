**世卫组织：日本核危机遭受最严重辐射的人增加患癌症的可能性**

世界卫生组织表示，在日本核灾难中那些受到核辐射最严重的人更容易患某种癌症。

世界卫生组织星期四在一份报告中说，受核辐射最严重的是福岛第一核电厂附近的居民。2011年3月大地震和海啸导致福岛核电厂的核反应堆出现核泄漏，使其周围地区受到核污染后，大约有11万人被撤离该地区。

世界卫生组织的报道说，福岛以外地区的居民患癌症的可能性并没有增加。

但是该组织估计，核污染最严重地区的女婴，成人后患甲状腺癌的可能性增加了百分之七十，受到同样核辐射的男婴，患白血病的可能性增加了百分之七。

**Higher Cancer Risk for Worst Exposed to Japan Nuclear Crisis: WHO**

The World Health Organization says those exposed to the worst levels of radiation during the Japanese nuclear disaster have a higher risk for developing certain types of cancer.

In a report Thursday, the U.N. agency said the most affected were those near the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant. Around 110,000 people in the area were evacuated in March 2011 after a massive earthquake and tsunami caused a meltdown in the plant's nuclear reactors and sent radiation spewing into the surrounding area.

The WHO report says there is little to no risk of increased cancer rates among those outside the Fukushima area.

But the agency estimates there is up to a 70 percent increased risk of thyroid cancer among females exposed as infants in the most contaminated area. The risk of leukemia increased by 7 percent for males exposed as infants.

**美国考虑扩大对叙利亚反政府武装的援助**

美国国务卿克里星期四将在罗马会晤叙利亚反对派领导人，届时他可能宣布美国将对叙利亚反政府武装提供新援助。

与此同时，“叙利亚之友”召开一次范围更广的会议，支持反对叙利亚总统阿萨德的大多数欧洲和中东国家都派出代表出席这次会议。

克里星期三说，美国正在寻找途径，加快叙利亚人民所追求的政治转变。

白宫发言人卡尼星期三说，美国将着重帮助叙利亚反对派变得更强势、更团结、更有组织性。他说，美国官员们将研究各种可行途径来帮助创立阿萨德政府下台后的叙利亚。

到目前为止，美国只是为叙利亚反政府军提供了非杀伤性物资的援助，比如通讯设备。华盛顿邮报和纽约时报报道说，扩大的援助可能包括军事训练和军事设备，比如车辆和夜视镜，但不会提供武器。
**US Considering Expanding Aid to Syrian Rebels**

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry meets with Syrian opposition leaders Thursday in Rome, where he could announce new aid for Syrian rebels.

The talks come amid a wider Friends of Syria meeting, bringing together mostly European and Middle Eastern nations that back those opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

Kerry said Wednesday the U.S. is seeking ways to speed up the political transition the Syrian people are seeking.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said Wednesday the United States is focused on helping the Syrian opposition become stronger, more cohesive, and better organized. He said U.S. officials will study every feasible option to help bring about a post-Assad Syria.

Until now, the United States has provided the Syrian rebels with non-lethal aid, such as communications equipment. The Washington Post and the New York Times report expanded aid could include military training and equipment, such as vehicles and night vision, but not weapons.
