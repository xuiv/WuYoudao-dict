**世界强国和伊朗同意未来举行核会谈**

世界强国在和伊朗就其有争议的核项目进行两天会谈后同意今后继续进行谈判，但会谈没有取得重大突破。

自从去年6月以来，双方星期二和星期三在哈萨克斯坦城市阿拉木图首次举行会谈。上次会谈由于双方不肯就各自的要求做出让步而宣告破裂。

双方现在计划下月在土耳其城市伊斯坦布尔举行专家会谈，此后双方的首席谈判代表将于4月初在哈萨克斯坦城市阿拉木图进行另一轮会谈。

所谓“5+1国家”，即美国、英国、法国、俄罗斯、中国和德国，本星期提出如果德黑兰同意停止一些核活动，就会放松对伊朗的某些制裁。

**World Powers, Iran Agree to Future Nuclear Talks **

Two days of talks between world powers and Iran about the country's controversial
nuclear program have resulted in an agreement to continue negotiations, but no major breakthroughs.

The meetings Tuesday and Wednesday in Almaty, Kazakhstan were the first since last June, when negotiations broke apart amid rigid demands by both sides.

They now plan to hold expert-level talks next month in Istanbul, Turkey, followed by another round of meetings between top negotiators in Almaty in early April.

The so-called P5+1 group of nations -- the United States, Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany -- offered this week to ease some sanctions against Iran if Tehran agrees to halt some of its nuclear activity.

有关官员说，虽然目前还不清楚导致火灾的原因，不过火势在星期三上午得到控制。

Fire officials say the blaze began in the early-morning hours and trapped people who were sleeping inside. The building had only one entrance, making rescue difficult. Efforts were also hampered by thick smoke blanketing the area.
