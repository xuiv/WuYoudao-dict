**两个国际会议讨论伊朗核项目问题**

伊朗的核项目是星期三两个不同会议讨论的主要内容，但是预计不会在伊朗6月的总统选举前有重大突破。

联合国原子能机构正在同伊朗官员举行去年初以来的第10轮谈判。与此同时，联合国原子能机构的调查人员继续谋求进入伊朗的核设施并得到有关的文件。

国际原子能机构对伊朗可能发展核武器表示关切，希望视察诸如帕琴军事基地，解决有关核项目的问题。

伊朗坚持帕琴是一个标准的军事设施，而且伊朗的核项目仅做和平用途。

另一方面，在伊斯坦布尔，伊朗的首席核谈判代表贾利利将同欧盟外交政策负责人阿什顿举行会谈。

** Parallel Talks Focus on Iranian Nuclear Program**

Iran's nuclear program is the focus of two separate meetings Wednesday, but no major breakthroughs are expected ahead of the country's June presidential election.

The U.N. nuclear agency is holding a 10th round of talks since the beginning of last year with Iranian officials, as its investigators continue to seek access to Iran's nuclear facilities and documents.

The International Atomic Energy Agency is concerned about Iran's potential development of nuclear weapons, and wants to visit facilities such as the Parchin military site to resolve questions about the program.

Iran insists Parchin is a standard military facility and that its nuclear program has only peaceful purposes.

Meanwhile, in Istanbul, Iran's top nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili will hold talks with European Union policy chief Catherine Ashton.

**朝鲜：被拘禁的美国公民开始在“特殊监狱”服刑**

朝鲜说，被判15年劳教的一名美国公民开始服刑。

朝鲜中央新闻社说，裴埈皓星期二“‘在一个特殊监狱’开始服刑”。报道没有详细说明。

这位44岁韩裔美国人的旅游运营商上个月被控阴谋推翻平壤政府。

裴埈皓去年11月在朝鲜东北部港口城市罗先被捕，平壤当局说裴埈皓当时携带着反平壤的宣传品。

上个星期，朝鲜最高法院指出，裴埈皓是个基督教福音传道者，企图在中国建立“制造阴谋的基地”，目的是要推翻朝鲜政府。

**NKorea: Detained US Citizen Begins Life at 'Special Prison'**

North Korea says an American citizen sentenced to 15 years of hard labor has begun serving his sentence.

The Korean Central News Agency said Kenneth Bae "started his life at a 'special prison' Tuesday." It did not elaborate.

The 44-year-old Korean-American tour operator was found guilty last month of plotting to overthrow the Pyongyang government.

He was arrested in November in the northeastern port city of Rason while in possession of what authorities said was anti-Pyongyang literature.

Last week, the North's supreme court described Bae as a Christian evangelist who was trying to set up "plot-breeding bases" in China aimed at toppling the North's government.
