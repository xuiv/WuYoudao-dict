**美国暂避财政悬崖 全球股市积极反应**

美国国会达成协议，避免了可能让世界最大经济体美国陷入经济衰退的财政悬崖，世界各地股市2013年开市第一天普遍上扬。

亚洲股市在新年第一天的交易中对来自美国的这项进展表示欢迎，香港恒生指数攀升了百分之2.9，悉尼和首尔股市分别上涨了百分之1.2和百分之1.7。日本和中国股市因节日闭市。

欧洲股市开市初期也大幅攀升。英国富时100指数上升了百分之1.8，德国DAX 30指数和巴黎CAC 40指数在上午的交易中都上涨了百分之1.9。

星期二晚上，美国国会众议院通过了议案，避免了5千亿美元的削减开支计划和增税计划,从而终止了几个星期以来一直阴影笼罩着全球股市的美国财政争辩。观察人士说，协议的达成只能提供短期保证，但并不太能解决投资者的未来担忧。

**Global Markets Higher As US Averts Fiscal Cliff**

World markets are opening 2013 on a high note, after the U.S. Congress reached a deal to end the so-called "fiscal cliff" crisis that threatened to send the world's largest economy into recession.

Asian stock markets welcomed the development in the first trading of the new year, with Hong Kong jumping 2.9 percent, Sydney gaining 1.2 percent, and Seoul adding 1.7 percent. Markets in Japan and China were closed for public holidays.

Early trading also surged in Europe. Britain's FTSE 100 rose 1.8 percent, while Germany's DAX 30 and Paris' CAC 40 indexes both jumped 1.9 percent in morning deals.

Late Tuesday, the House of Representatives cleared a deal to avoid $500 billion in spending cuts and tax increases, endings weeks of quarreling that had overshadowed global markets. Observers say the deal will provide short-term certainty, but will not do much to address investor concerns about the future.

**60 Killed in Ivory Coast Stampede**

Officials in Ivory Coast say at least 60 people were crushed to death during a stampede at a New Year's celebration in Abidjan.

Rescue workers say about 50 others were injured in the incident early Tuesday near a stadium in the Plateau district, where hundreds of thousands of people had gathered to watch fireworks.

Most of those killed were children and teenagers. The government says it is investigating what caused the stampede. President Alassane Ouattara calls it a national tragedy.
