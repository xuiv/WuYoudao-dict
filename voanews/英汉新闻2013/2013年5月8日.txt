**马来西亚警方宣布反对派抗议“违法” **

马来西亚警方威胁要逮捕那些参加一个集会的人们。这次集会是抗议一次选举的结果。反对派说，选举中出现大规模的舞弊。

马来西亚国家警察总长说，将于星期三晚间举行的抗议集会是非法的，因为组织者、仗义执言的反对派领袖安华没有申请政府的许可。

马来西亚的“和平集会法”严格规定抗议和公众集会，要求组织者要为集会获得事先许可。

前副总理安华说，该法是对言论自由的不民主的攻击。

安华鼓励马来西亚人身着黑色服装去抗议。这次集会将在吉隆坡的一个体育场举行。他说，这是“激烈运动”的开始，目的是质疑这次选举结果，改革马来西亚的选举制度。

星期天投票的最后结果显示，长期执政的国民阵线联盟获得了议会的多数席位，尽管普选投票输给了安华的反对党人民联盟。

**Malaysian Police Declare Opposition Protest 'Illegal'**

Malaysian police have threatened to arrest participants in a rally being organized to protest results of an election the opposition says was marred by massive fraud.

National police chief says the protest to be held late Wednesday is illegal because the organizer, outspoken opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, did not apply for a government permit.

Malaysia's Peaceful Assembly Act tightly regulates protests and public gatherings, and requires organizers to receive advance permission for rallies. Anwar, an ex-deputy prime minister, has said the law is an undemocratic assault on free speech.

Anwar has encouraged Malaysians to wear black to the protest, which is to be held at a sports stadium in Kuala Lumpur. He says it is the beginning of a "fierce movement" to challenge the vote and reform Malaysia's electoral system.

Final results from the Sunday vote show the long-ruling National Front coalition captured a large majority of the seats, despite losing the popular vote to Anwar's Pakatan Rakyat coalition.
