**奥巴马由于政府关闭而不出席APEC峰会**

由于美国政府部分关闭，奥巴马总统取消了出访亚洲的计划。美国政府关闭已经进入第四天。

白宫星期四晚间宣布，奥巴马总统决定取消对印度尼西亚和文莱的访问，是考虑到在政府关闭期间出访存在难度，而且奥巴马计划继续敦促共和党人同意就结束政府关闭状态进行表决。

白宫说，克里国务卿将率领美国代表团访问印尼、文莱以及马来西亚和菲律宾。克里将代替奥巴马总统出席在巴厘举行的亚太经合组织峰会。

奥巴马在星期四早些时候说，一项简单明了、不牵涉其它问题、不排除奥巴马医改法案的政府开支议案会通过众议院表决。奥巴马指责众议院议长贝纳迎合一小群保守的共和党极端分子的心意，这些人想不为奥巴马倡导的平价医保法提供经费。

贝纳说，奥巴马拒绝谈判。他表示，他所要求的只是就奥巴马医改法案进行讨论，是他所说的对美国人民 的“公平”。

Obama to Miss APEC Summit Due to Shutdown

President Obama has canceled an upcoming trip to Asia because of the partial U.S. government shutdown that has entered its fourth day Friday.

The White House announced late Thursday that the president made his decision to cancel visits to Indonesia and Brunei based on the difficulty in moving forward with foreign travel in the face of the shutdown and his plans to continue pressuring Republicans to allow a vote to reopen the government.

The White House says Secretary of State John Kerry will lead U.S. delegations to both countries, as well as to Malaysia and the Philippines. Kerry will attend the APEC summit in Bali in place of President Obama.

Earlier Thursday, President Obama said a simple bill to fund the government with no other issues attached -- including his signature health care plan, nicknamed "Obamacare" -- would pass the House of Representatives. Mr. Obama accused Republican House Speaker John Boehner of catering to a small group of conservative Republican extremists who want to defund or delay the health care plan as part of the next budget.

Boehner says Mr. Obama is refusing to negotiate. The speaker says all he wants is a discussion on the health care law, nicknamed "Obamacare" and what he calls "fairness" for the American people.

**警方：击毙一名女嫌疑人**

在美国首都华盛顿的国会山附近，警察开枪击毙一名女子。这名女子曾试图开车闯过在白宫附近设置的障碍物，随后警察开车追逐。
华盛顿警察局长拉尼尔对记者说，警察向这名女子驾驶的汽车开枪，打死了她。拉尼尔说，在星期四下午发生的这起事件中，曾在两个地点开枪。

国会山警方负责人戴恩说，看上去这是一起孤立事件，与恐怖主义无关。他表示，一名警官从那名女子驾驶的车中救出了一名一岁的孩子。
有关当局说，两名警官在这起事件中受伤，但目前状况稳定，没有危险。
这起事件发生时，美国国会曾经出于安全原因一度被封锁。不过国会办公大厦里面的议员们没有受到任何威胁。
警方拒绝对这名驾车女子的身份和动机发表评论，并表示目前正在调查这起事件。
Police: Female Suspect Killed

Police have shot and killed a woman near the U.S. Capitol in Washington, after she tried to drive through a barricade near the White House before driving away and leading officers on a dramatic car chase.

Washington Police Chief Cathy Lanier told reporters the woman died after police fired into her vehicle. Lanier said shots were fired in at least two locations during the confrontation Thursday afternoon.

Capitol Police Chief Kim Dine said this appeared to be an isolated incident with no link to terrorism. He said a police officer rescued a 1-year-old child from the car after the chase.

Authorities said two officers were hurt in the incident, but that both are in good condition and expected to recover.

The U.S. Capitol was put under a brief security lockdown as the situation unfolded. But there never was a threat to lawmakers inside the building.

Police are refusing to comment on the identity or motive of the woman who drove the car. They say the incident remains under investigation.
