**美国承诺向菲律宾提供四千万美元军事援助**

美国国务卿克里宣布向菲律宾提供四千亿美元的新援助。菲律宾是美国长期盟友，它跟中国卷入一场领土纷争。

星期二克里在马尼拉作出上述宣布。他会晤了菲律宾总统阿基诺和外长德尔罗萨里奥。

美国的新援助将帮助改善菲律宾的海上防卫能力，加强针对该国南部的穆斯林反叛力量的反恐斗争。

新援助是星期一宣布的三千二百亿美元的援助的附加部分。星期一宣布的援助是为了帮助东南亚国家保护领海。其中包括给越南的一千八百万美元。

克里说，新增加的援助不是为了抗衡日益加强的中国的强势立场。不过他警告各方，不要做出“挑衅性”行动。

US Pledges $40 Million in Military Aid to Philippines

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has announced $40 million in new military aid to the Philippines, a longtime U.S. ally involved in a territorial dispute with China.

Kerry made the announcement Tuesday in Manila, where he is meeting with Philippines Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario and President Benigno Aquino.

The aid will help improve the Philippines' maritime defense capabilities and boost counterterrorism operations against a Muslim insurgency in the south.

It comes on top of a $32 million package announced Monday to help Southeast Asian countries protect their territorial waters, including $18 million for Vietnam.

Kerry said the increased aid is not aimed at countering rising Chinese assertiveness, though he warned against all sides making "provocative" moves.

He also repeated U.S. opposition to China's new Air Defense Identification Zone in the East China Sea, which includes disputed areas claimed by Japan.
