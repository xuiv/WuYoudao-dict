** Pope Poised to Open Weeklong Visit to Brazil**

Pope Francis on Monday opens a weeklong visit to Brazil -- the world's largest Roman Catholic country that has in recent weeks been swept up in waves of anti-government protests.

More than 1 million young Catholics are expected to flock to Rio de Janeiro to celebrate the new pope. His itinerary includes meetings with local and national leaders and events connected to Thursday's celebration of World Youth Day.

The pontiff's schedule also includes a meeting with young inmates at a Rio prison, and a visit to shantytowns largely cleared of drug traffickers earlier this year by police and the Brazilian army. He also will inaugurate a Rio hospital wing for the treatment of drug addicts, and will pray at a shrine to Our Lady of Aparecida -- the patron saint of Brazil.

The former Argentine Cardinal will be welcomed to the country by Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff.
