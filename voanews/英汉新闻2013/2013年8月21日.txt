**埃及法院星期三下令释放前总统穆巴拉克**

埃及司法部门和安全部队说，埃及一家法院星期三下令释放前总统穆巴拉克。 穆巴拉克两年多前被人民起义运动推翻后一直被关在监狱里。

穆巴拉克的律师对路透社说， 穆巴拉星期四就可能获释。85岁的穆巴拉克因被控未能阻止杀戮反政府运动的抗议者而面临再审。但是法院星期三判决说，继续关押穆巴拉克已无任何法律根据。

星期一，埃及法院判决穆巴拉克和他的儿子被控盗用公共资金修建总统府的罪名不成立。

另外在星期三，埃及政府继续对被罢免的穆尔西总统的政党施压，逮捕了穆斯林兄弟会的一名发言人和一个跟该组织相关的伊斯兰教人士。

穆兄会所属政治党派的发言人穆哈德 阿里星期三在开罗机场被捕，此外，当局还在埃及利比亚边界附近逮捕了伊斯兰教人士阿加齐。当局说， 二人都企图逃离埃及。

在此前一天，埃及临时军政府逮捕了穆斯林兄弟会的精神领袖巴迪。70岁的巴迪因涉嫌6月份煽动对要求总统穆尔西下台的示威者实施酷刑和加以杀害而被捕。示威者要求总统穆尔西下台。一家法院星期二下令，在检察官们调查这些指称期间要拘押巴迪15天。

与此同时，联合国主管政治事务的副秘书长费尔特曼正在开罗为结束血腥的政治危机而举行会谈。费尔特曼星期二抵达埃及进行三天的斡旋。联合国发言人说， 他的任务是“促进恢复和平与和解”。

Egyptian Court Orders Mubarak's Release

Judicial and security forces say an Egyptian court Wednesday ordered former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak be released from prison, where he has been held for more than two years after a popular uprising drove him from power.

Mr. Mubarak's lawyer, Fareed el-Deeb, tells Reuters the former ruler could be freed as early as Thursday. The 85-year-old Mubarak is being retried on charges he failed to stop the killing of protesters during the popular revolt that swept him from office. But the court ruled there are no longer any legal grounds for his continued detention.

Earlier this week ((Monday)), an Egyptian court cleared Mr. Mubarak of charges that he and his sons stole public money for presidential palaces.

Also Wednesday, Egyptian authorities arrested a Muslim Brotherhood spokesman and a fiery preacher with ties to the group, as Egypt's interim government continues to pressure the party of ousted president Mohamed Morsi.

Mourad Ali, a spokesman for the Brotherhood's political arm was taken into custody Wednesday at the Cairo airport, while cleric Safwat Hegazy was arrested near the Libyan border. Officials said both were trying to flee the country.

The arrests come a day after authorities detained Brotherhood spiritual leader Mohamed Badie. A court ordered him held for 15 days while prosecutors investigate allegations that he incited the torture and killing of protesters in June.

Also Wednesday, the United Nations political affairs chief is in Cairo for talks aimed at ending Egypt's political crisis. Under-Secretary-General Jeffrey Feltman is on a three-day mission described by a spokesman as a "push to restore peace and forge reconciliation."

**叙利亚活动人士指责政府再次使用化学武器**

叙利亚活动人士说，政府军在首都大马士革附近发动攻势，打死至少100人。叙利亚活动人士还指责政府军在星期三的袭击中使用了化学武器，

叙利亚政府立即对这种说法予以否认。 叙利亚国营媒体报道了大马士革附近的军事活动，说政府军消灭了恐怖主义分子。 当局一直将反对阿萨德的反叛者称作恐怖主义分子。

总部设在英国的叙利亚人权了望台说，叙利亚军队向东戈塔和西戈塔几处地点发射火箭弹。该组织援引当地活动人士的话说，政府军使用了“有毒气体”。

英国和阿拉伯联盟要求叙利亚允许已在叙利亚境内的联合国调查人员到所说的化学武器使用现场进行实地考察。

英国外交大臣黑格说， 他对有关叙利亚军队使用化学武器的说法非常担心。如果被证明确有发生，这就意味着冲突令人震惊地升级了。他说，英国将在联合安理会提出这一问题。

在叙利亚发生暴力事件之际，联合国化学武器检查员在叙利亚执行为期两星期的使命，对早些时候发生的事件进行调查，叙利亚政府和反政府武装都指责对方使用化学武器。

Syrian Activists Accuse Military of Fresh Chemical Weapons Attacks

Syrian activists say at least 100 people have been killed in a government offensive near the capital, Damascus, where forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad are alleged to have used chemical weapons.

Syria quickly denied allegations of a chemical attack. State media reported military activity in the area, saying that government forces had killed "terrorists" - a term used to refer to rebels opposed to Mr. Assad.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the military fired rockets at sites in Eastern Ghouta and Western Ghouta. It cited activists in the area who said "poisonous gasses" were used.

Britian and the Arab League have called on Syria to allow U.N. invesigators already in the country to examine sites of the alleged chemical attacks.

British Foreign Secretary William Hague said he was "deeply concerned" about the reported chemical attacks, and said if proven true, they represent a "shocking escalation." He said Britain will refer the matter to the U.N. Security Council.

The violence comes as United Nations chemical weapons inspectors carry out a two-week mission in Syria to investigate earlier incidents in which the Syrian government and rebels accused each other of carrying out chemical attacks.
