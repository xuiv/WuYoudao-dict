**美国参议院批准布伦南出任中央情报局局长**

美国参议院批准约翰•布伦南出任美国中央情报局局长。此前，一位参议员针对白宫的无人机政策，一度威胁要以无限期讨论的方式阻止对这 一提名的表决。

参议院星期四的表决结果是63票支持、34票反对。在这之前，参议院另行投票，终止就这一问题再进行任何辩论，并启动确认提名程序。

来自肯塔基州的共和党参议员兰德•保罗曾试图以无限期讨论的方式阻止对布伦南提名的表决。保罗在参议院不停地发言长达13个小时。他要求奥巴马政府具体说明限制在美国本土用无人机打击恐怖嫌疑人。

美国司法部长霍尔德向保罗送交一封短信，说明奥巴马总统无权下令在美国本土击毙没有参与战斗的美国公民。

霍尔德本星期早些时候说，奥巴马无意在美国本土下令发动无人机攻击，但在特殊情况下奥巴马可能这样做。

奥巴马政府下令在国外使用无人机击毙恐怖嫌疑人，包括美国公民。

布伦南长期在中央情报局任职，是奥巴马总统的反恐事务最高顾问。他表示支持白宫的无人机政策。

**Senate Confirms Brennan to Head CIA **

The U.S. Senate has confirmed John Brennan as the new head of the Central Intelligence Agency after one senator threatened to hold up the vote indefinitely over the White House drone policy.

Thursday's vote was 63 to 34. It came after the Senate held a separate vote to cut off any more debate and and proceed with the confirmation.

Kentucky Republican Rand Paul filibustered against the Brennan confirmation, talking on the Senate floor non-stop for 13 hours. He demanded the Obama administration specify limits on using drone strikes to attack U.S. terror suspects on U.S. soil.

Attorney General Eric Holder sent Paul a brief letter stating that the president does not have the authority to kill a U.S. citizen not engaged in combat on U.S. soil.

Holder said earlier this week that while the president has no intention of ordering a drone strike within the United States, he could do so under an "extraordinary circumstance."

The Obama administration has used drones to kill terror suspects overseas, including U.S. citizens.

Brennnan is a long-time CIA official who had been Pendent Obama's top counterterrorism advisor. He has said he supported the drone policy.
