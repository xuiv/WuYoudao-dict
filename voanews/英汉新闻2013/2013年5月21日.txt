**Detained Chinese Fishermen, Boat Released by North Korea**

Officials in Beijing say 16 Chinese fishermen who were seized for ransom in North Korea have been released.

The official Xinhua news agency reported the development Tuesday, quoting a Chinese consular official in Pyongyang who spoke with the owner of the fishing boat. The official said the men were safe and on their way home, but he gave no other details.

The owner of the boat says North Korea was demanding nearly $100,000 for the return of the boat and crew, which were taken May 6 in the waters between China and the Korean peninsula. He says he did not pay any money for the release.

It remains unclear who in North Korea was responsible for the kidnapping. Xinhua said the boat was "seized by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea," the North's official name, but it did not elaborate.

The incident has prompted an angry reaction on China's microblogs, and threatens to upset already tense diplomatic relations between the two allies.
