**前美国国安局长在火车上接受“不在记录”的采访遭偷听**

前美国中央情报局长和国家安全局长海登在火车上接受了一系列采访，他本以为采访是匿名的，结果他发表的评论出现在推特上。

海登星期四乘火车从华盛顿前往纽约途中，通过手机向记者们发表了谈话。

自由派政治组织MoveOn.org的华盛顿分部前主任马特兹当时坐在海登不远处，他把海登谈话的部分内容放在推特上，包括有关国安局监听丑闻、中情局秘密监狱以及奥巴马总统的智能手机的评论。

马特兹在推特上说，前国安局长海登作为一名前政府高层官员，在火车上大谈背景情况，而且听上去是在为自己辩解。

海登后来表示，他当时没有批评奥巴马总统。

Former NSA Chief Gives Eavesdropped 'Off Record' Interviews on Train

A former CIA and National Security Agency chief gave what he thought was a series of anonymous interviews on a train, but his comments ended up on Twitter.

Michael Hayden talked to reporters on his cell phone Thursday while traveling on a train from Washington to New York.

Tom Matzzie, the former Washington director of the liberal political group MoveOn.org, was sitting near Hayden. Matzzie divulged portions of Hayden's conversation on Twitter, including comments on the NSA spying scandal, CIA secret prisons and President Barack Obama's smartphone.

Matzzie tweeted "former NSA spy boss Michael Hayden on Acela (train) behind me blabbing on background as a former senior admin (administration) official,' sounds defensive."

Hayden said later that he did not criticize Mr. Obama.

Search Continues for Americans Kidnapped by Pirates Off Nigeria

Nigerian authorities are continuing their search for two American men kidnapped by pirates off the Gulf of Guinea.

The captain and chief engineer of a U.S.-flagged oil supply vessel were taken Wednesday during an attack in international waters off the coast of Nigeria.

The 68-meter C-Retriever is owned by the U.S. oil servicing company Edison Chouest Offshore, which has not commented on the situation.

U.S. officials say the vessel and the rest of its crew were released by the pirates. It is not clear if the American men are still at sea or were taken to land.

The Nigerian military has ordered a search and rescue operation. Officials have refused to say whether the U.S. military is also involved.

U.S. defense officials say they are monitoring the situation, noting that the closest U.S. military contingent is a Marine Corps training unit in the Gulf of Guinea.
