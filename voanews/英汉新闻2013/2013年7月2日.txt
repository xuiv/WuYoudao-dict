**东盟地区论坛将讨论朝鲜核项目及南中国海争端问题**

来自27个国家的外交官在文莱举行会议，预计主要议题是朝鲜核项目以及南中国海领土争端。

东盟地区论坛于星期二召开，参加朝鲜去核化六方会谈的各方代表都出席了会议。六方会谈于2008年宣告破裂。

朝鲜近几个星期来一直表示重启六方会谈，但是并没有显示出愿意放弃其核武器的迹象。

美国国务卿克里星期一说，美国、中国、日本和韩国在坚持朝鲜必须去核化问题上的立场完全一致。

克里还敦促东盟推动制定涵盖南中国海争端的行为准则。中国和几个东南亚国家都宣称对该海域拥有主权。

中国一直不肯与东盟就南中国海领土争端问题进行协商。星期天，中国同意与东盟就拟议中的行为准则进行正式磋商。

**North Korea, South China Sea to Top ASEAN Regional Forum Agenda**

Diplomats from 27 countries are meeting in Brunei, with North Korea's nuclear program and territorial disputes in the South China Sea expected to top the agenda.
The ASEAN Regional Forum that opened Tuesday includes delegates from all six nations involved in the nuclear disarmament talks with North Korea that were disbanded in 2008.

North Korea has in recent weeks proposed restarting the talks, but has shown few signs it is ready to give up its nuclear weapons.

On Monday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the United States, China, Japan, and South Korea are "absolutely" unified in their insistence that Pyongyang must denuclearize.

He also urged ASEAN to make progress on a code of conduct covering disputes in the South China Sea, where Beijing has overlapping claims with several Southeast Asian countries.

China, which has been reluctant to deal with ASEAN on the disputes, on Sunday agreed to hold "official consultations" with the regional body on a proposed code of conduct.

**奥巴马结束非洲贸易之行**

美国总统奥巴马结束了他的非洲之行。奥巴马说，他确信有了正确的方法，非洲大陆人民“就能够开创一个繁荣的新时代。”

结束非洲之行之前，奥巴马参观了坦桑尼亚一家一度闲置的发电厂，并发表讲话。这家工厂在美国和坦桑尼亚的共同努力下重新开工。

奥巴马在讲话时宣传一项耗资70亿美元的新计划，让更多的非洲人用上电，促进非洲大陆的经济发展。

奥巴马结束了一个星期的非洲之行。坦桑尼亚总统基奎特到达累斯萨拉姆机场为他送行。另有几百名坦桑尼亚人也到机场欢送奥巴马。

星期二早些时候，美国前总统乔治•W•布什跟奥巴马一道参加了敬献花圈的仪式，向美国驻坦桑尼亚首都达累斯萨拉姆大使馆1998年爆炸事件的11名遇难者表达敬意。

**Obama Closes Trade-Focused Africa Trip**

U.S. President Barack Obama has wrapped up his trip to Africa and says he is convinced that with the right approach the continent's people "can unleash a new era of prosperity."

Mr. Obama left Tuesday after visiting and speaking at a once-idle power plant in Tanzania that was restarted through a joint U.S.-Tanzanian effort.

There, the president promoted his new $7 billion program to give more Africans access to electricity, with the goal of boosting the continent's economies.

He ended his week-long visit to Africa with a ceremony at Dar es Salaam airport, where he was seeing off President Jakaya Kikwete and hundreds of cheering and flag-waving Tanzanians.

Earlier Tuesday, former president George W. Bush joined Mr. Obama for a wreath-laying ceremony to honor the 11 people killed in the 1998 bombing of the U.S. embassy in Dar es Salaam.
