**日本长崎举行仪式纪念遭受原子弹轰炸68周年**


日本城市长崎纪念美国对该市进行原子弹轰炸68周年。长崎在那次轰炸中被夷为平地，第二次世界大战也随之结束。

在星期五举行的纪念仪式上，长崎市长田上富久批评日本政府拒绝签署一项反对使用核武器的声明。这项声明是在今年4月举行的一次国际裁军会议上提出的。

1945年8月6日，美国在广岛投下一枚原子弹，造成大约14万人死亡。同年8月9日，美国又在长崎投下另一枚原子弹，导致大约7万人死亡。

星期二，广岛举行了纪念原子弹轰炸68周年仪式。日本首相安倍晋三对大约5万民众说，日本负有推动结束核武器的特殊责任。

**JAPAN NUCLEAR ANNIVERSARY**

Nagasaki Marks 68th Anniversary of US Atomic Bombing

The Japanese city of Nagasaki has observed the 68th anniversary of the U.S. atomic bombing that reduced the city to rubble and ended Word War Two.

Nagasaki Mayor Tomihisa Taue criticized the Japanese government at a ceremony Friday for refusing to sign a statement rejecting the use of nuclear weapons. The statement was offered at an international disarmament meeting in April.

The United States dropped an atomic bomb on the city of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, killing about 140,000 people. Days later, on August 9, Nagasaki was hit by a second nuclear bomb that killed about 70,000.

Hiroshima held an observance of the first bombing on Tuesday. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told a crowd of about 50,000 that Japan has a unique responsibility to push for the end of nuclear weapons.


**斯诺登使用的电邮服务中断**


美国泄密者斯诺登使用的美国加密电子邮件服务已经关闭。电邮服务商看起来是因为受到政府方面的压力中断服务的。

电子邮件公司拉维毕特Lavabit在其网站上发布了关闭服务的消息。公司所有者和经营商拉达尔•利维森（Ladar Levison）在这则信息中说，他不能透露关闭原因，否则有违美国法律。他表示，他已经两度就披露这方面的信息提出了“适当的请求”。

该消息说，公司方面已经开始准备应付法律纠纷，并且警告大家“不要相信他们将私人信息存储在位于美国的公司会是安全的”。

拉瓦毕特在关闭服务前曾对其用户承诺，通过其服务器发出的邮件均经过加密，只有提供用户密码才能阅读这些电邮。

另一个名为“静音圈”（Silent Circle）的电邮服务也已经停止运行。

**US SNOWDEN SERVER**

E-mail Service Linked to Snowden Suspends Service


An encrypted e-mail service in the United States, believed to have been used by U.S. leaker Edward Snowden, has shut down in what appears to be response to pressure from the government.

The e-mail company Lavabit posted a message on its website saying the service is being suspended. Owner and operator Ladar Levison wrote in the message that he cannot share the reason because of U.S. laws against it. He said he had twice made "the appropriate requests" to share the information.

The message said the company has begun preparation for a court battle, and warned others against "anyone trusting their private data to a company with physical ties to the United States."

Before its suspension, Lavabit promised its users that all e-mail sent from its servers would be encrypted in such a way that the emails could only be read by providing the user's password.

A second service, known as Silent Circle, has since also suspended operations.
