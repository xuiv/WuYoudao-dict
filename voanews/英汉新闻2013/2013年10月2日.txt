**亚洲开发银行调低经济增长率预测**

由于中国和印度经济表现疲软以及对美国可能削减刺激经济措施的担忧，亚洲开发银行调低了对亚洲发展中国家经济增长的预期值。

亚洲开发银行星期二发表报告，预测亚洲发展中国家2013年的经济增长率为6%，而4月发表的报告做出的经济增长率预测是6.6%。亚洲开发银行预计，亚洲发展中国家2014年的经济增长率将小幅提高至6.2%，低于4月报告预测的6.7%。

总部设在菲律宾的亚洲开发银行之所以修正对亚洲发展中国家经济增长率的预期，是因为中国和印度的经济增长速度减缓。此外，亚洲开发银行还指出，人们对美国计划最终削减刺激经济措施感到担忧。美国采取刺激措施是为了使本国经济摆脱2009年经济衰退的影响。

但亚洲开发银行说，亚洲的新兴市场将有能力应对美联储收紧货币宽松政策所带来的局面。该银行还指出，大多数亚洲经济体保持着健全的经常账户盈余，而且拥有足够的外汇储备。
Asian Development Bank Trims Growth Forecast

The Asian Development Bank has cut its growth forecast for the region's developing countries because of weakness in its two largest economies and concerns over a possible reduction in U.S. stimulus measures.

In its twice-yearly report Tuesday, the bank predicted developing Asia will grow at 6 percent in 2013, down from its April estimate of 6.6 percent. For 2014, it expects growth will accelerate slightly to 6.2 percent, down from its prior estimate of 6.7 percent.

The Philippines-based lender revised its predictions because of slower growth in China and India. It also cited nervousness over Washington's plans to eventually trim stimulus measures used to boost the American economy from the depths of the 2009 recession.

But it said Asia's emerging markets will be able to deal with the U.S. Federal Reserve's eventual scaling back of the monetary easing policies, noting that most of its economies have healthy current-account surpluses and ample foreign currency reserves.

**抗议者谴责对于越南活动人士的审判**

1百多名抗议者在越南首都举行集会，谴责当局审判一位著名人权活动人士。他们说，对这位人权活动人士的审判是出于政治动机。

星期三，数百名警察在河内人民法院周围警戒，律师、博客作者李作全因被控逃税而受审。

李作全的支持者不能接近法院。但至少1百人聚集河内其他地点，挥舞标语牌，呼喊口号，要求释放李作全。

李作全是越南最著名的异议人士。在去年12月被逮捕之前，这位信仰天主教的律师在其博客中撰写有关人权、民主、宗教自由以及其他敏感问题的文章。

人权组织说，这一案件再次显示河内当局扩大了对异议人士的镇压。人权观察说，对李作全的起诉是出于政治动机，并敦促立即释放他。

Protesters Denounce Trial of Vietnamese Activist

Scores of protesters have gathered in Vietnam's capital to denounce what they say is a politically motivated trial against a prominent rights activist.

Hundreds of police Wednesday formed a ring around the Hanoi People's Court, where lawyer and blogger Le Quoc Quan is to faces charges of tax evasion.

His supporters were not able to reach the court. But at least 100 people gathered elsewhere in the city, waving signs and shouting slogans calling for Quan's release.

Quan is one of Vietnam's most well-known government critics. Before his arrest in December, the Catholic lawyer ran a blog on human rights, democracy, religious freedom and other sensitive topics.

Rights groups say the case is another example of Hanoi's widening crackdown on those it sees as opponents. Human Rights Watch called the charges "politically motivated" and called for his immediate release.
