** Taiwan Begins Military Drills Near Philippines to Protest Fisherman's Death**

The family of the fisherman and Taiwanese officials have refused to meet the Philippine president's personal representative who was sent to Taiwan to apologize for the death.

Taiwan's premier Jiang Yi-huah rejected the apology of President Benigno Aquino because it referred to the shooting as "unfortunate" and "unintentional." Taiwan also rejected an earlier statement of regret by a lower-ranking official.
