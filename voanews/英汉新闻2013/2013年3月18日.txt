** Canadian Prisoners Break Out in Helicopter Escape**

Canadian authorities say two Quebec prison inmates who made a daring broad daylight escape, climbing a rope into a hovering helicopter, have been recaptured.

Police said early Monday they have detained four people in connection with the escape.

Canada's The Globe and Mail newspaper reports the helicopter was hijacked Sunday afternoon from a tour company in Mont-Tremblant by two men posing as tourists.

Once the helicopter was aloft, the men held a gun on the pilot, ordering him to fly to St. Jerome, 60 kilometers northwest of Montreal where the inmates climbed aboard the aircraft.

Authorities say one inmate and two accomplices were captured late Sunday, and the other inmate surrendered early Monday after he was surrounded in a building where he had barricaded himself.

**研究报告：媒体隍7d支紧缩改变美国人获取信息方式**

一项新研究结果显示，美国各地媒体的编辑部由于预算紧缩，不得不解雇记者，削减报道开支，致使越来越多的观众和读者转而上网获取每天的信息。

没有党派色彩的皮尤研究中心星期一发表了有关美国新闻业界状况的年度报告。报告说，由于传统媒体不像过去那样提供信息，将近三分之一的受访者不再依靠这类信息来源。

这份报告指出削减开支的明显后果，包括做深入报道的记者人数减少，电视新闻的时间缩短。报告说，美国有线电视新闻网等有线电视频道现在播放更多的采访报道，每天的现场报道减少，而以往这类报道所占的地位重要得多。

此外，年轻人开始远离电视新闻，在30岁以下的人群中，电视新闻观众从2006年的42%减少到去年的28%。

** Study: Media Budget Woes Changing How Americans Get News**
A new study says budget woes that have forced newsrooms across the United States to lay off reporters and spend less on their coverage are sending viewers and readers to emerging online forms of learning about the day's news.

The non-partisan Pew Research Center issued its yearly report on the U.S. news industry Monday, saying nearly a third of people it surveyed stopped going to a particular news source because it no longer offered the information it once did.

The report cites the tangible effects of the cutbacks, with fewer reporters to look deeply into stories, and television news programs showing fewer stories that are shorter in length. It says cable channels, such as CNN, are airing more interviews and less of the day-to-day live news that once played a much larger role in their coverage.

On the local level, young people are fleeing television news broadcasts, with viewership among those under age 30 dropping from 42 percent in 2006 to 28 percent last year.
