**克里：美、中、日在朝去核上意见‘一致’**

美国国务卿约翰•克里说，美国、中国、日本和韩国在坚持朝鲜去核问题上“完全一致”。

克里星期一在文莱会晤中国外交部长王毅之后说，确保该地区和平与稳定的唯一途径是朝鲜履行先前在六方会谈中达成的去核共识。

克里说，“实现去核以及可能实现的关系正常化，会让这个地区更美好。关系正常化不仅指韩国和朝鲜之间，或者是中国和朝鲜之间，也是指美国和朝鲜以及世界其它国家的关系正常化。要做到这些，最终取决于一套严格的去核步骤以及与之相关的严肃磋商。”

克里星期一还会见了韩国外长尹炳世与日本外相岸田文雄。克里正在文莱参加为期两天的东盟十国会议。

早前他曾敦促东盟在制定涵盖南中国海争端的行为准则上取得进展。

**Kerry: US, China, Japan 'United' on North Korea Denuclearization**

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry says the United States, China, Japan and South Korea are "absolutely united" in their insistence that North Korea denuclearize.

Kerry said Monday after meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Brunei that the only way to ensure peace and stability in the region is for North Korea to live up to its agreement from prior six-party talks to denuclearize.

"That the region will be better with the denuclearization and the possibilities of normal relationships, not just between the south and the north or china and North Korea, but between the United States and North Korea and the rest of the world, lies at the end of engaging in a serious set of steps to denuclearize and serious negotiations that could accompany that."

Kerry also met Monday with the foreign ministers of Japan and South Korea as part of two days of meetings with the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

Earlier, he urged ASEAN to make progress on a code of conduct covering disputes over the South China Sea.
