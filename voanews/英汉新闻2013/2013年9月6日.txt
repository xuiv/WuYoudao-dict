**奥巴马，普京未能解决在叙利亚问题上的分歧**

美国总统奥巴马和俄罗斯总统普京在G20峰会期间讨论了叙利亚问题，但在可能对叙利亚发动打击行动的问题上仍然意见分歧。

奥巴马总统在星期五的记者会上说，他与普京总统的对话是“坦诚的”和“具有建设性的。” 但是他补充说，他不相信谈话会改变俄罗斯反对任何外国军事干预叙利亚的立场。

针对叙利亚政府被指称于今年8月使用化学武器杀害1400个平民，奥巴马总统正设法赢得国际间支持美国对叙利亚动武以惩罚叙利亚政府的行动。奥巴马说，他星期二晚上将对美国人民发表有关这个问题的讲话，并且同国会共同努力达成一项授权采取军事行动的决议。

奥巴马总统说, 大多数参加G20峰会晚宴的领导人，以及在星期五早上持续举行的讨论中，都没有对美国关于叙利亚应对化武攻击行动负责的结论感到不安。他说，各国领导人一致认为，必须坚持反对使用化学武器的国际规范。

然而，他说，世界各大国就不经联合国安理会批准而对叙利亚动武的问题意见分歧。

普京说，对叙利亚的任何打击行动都是“非法”的。他说，化学武器攻击行动是接受外援的叙利亚反政府军的一项挑衅行动。

普京说，印度、印度尼西亚和南非等国家领导人在星期四G20峰会晚宴上发表讲话，反对任何军事干预行动。

Obama, Putin Fail to Resolve Differences on Syria

U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin are still at odds over a potential strike on Syria, after discussing the issue on the sidelines of the G20 ((Group of 20)) economic summit in Russia.

In a Friday news conference, Mr. Obama said his conversation with Mr. Putin was "candid" and "constructive." But he added that he did not believe the talk would change Russia's opposition to any foreign military intervention in Syria.

Mr. Obama is trying to win international support for military action to punish Syria's government for an alleged chemical attack that killed more than 1,400 people in August. The U.S. president said he would address the American people about the issue Tuesday night and continue to work with Congress on a resolution authorizing military action.

The president said most world leaders attending a G20 dinner, and discussions that continued into the early morning hours Friday, were "comfortable" with the U.S. conclusion that the Syrian government was responsible for the attack. He said the leaders were "unanimous" in believing that international norms against the use of chemical weapons had to be maintained.

However, he said world powers were divided on launching military action without going through the United Nations Security Council.

Mr. Putin said any foreign strike on Syria would be "illegal." He said the chemical attack was a "provocation" by opposition fighters in Syria who are receiving foreign support.

Mr. Putin said leaders from India, Indonesia, South Africa and India were among those who spoke against any military intervention at Thursday's G20 dinner.

**美国失业率下降**

美国劳工部说，美国就业市场8月份继续扩张，失业率降至2008年末以来的最低点，雇主又增加16万9000就业岗位。

政府星期五说，上个月的失业率微幅降至7.3%.

8月份新的就业数据显示，世界最大的经济体美国的经济正在扩张，但仅是适度扩张，速度不及2013年年初。

美国政府在最新的报告中还下修了6月和7月的就业数据，跟第一次预估数字相比，两个月共减少了7万4千个就业人数，相对疲弱的就业增长可能会让美联储的经济决策变得复杂化。

美联储的决策者们一直在考虑是否减少每个月850亿美元购入债券的数量。美国央行通过购买债券向美国经济注入资金，推动复苏。

美联储表示，央行可能今年减少购入债券，并且在2014年中期之前结束购买。决策者们准备两个星期之后开会，会后可能下令减少购买，或者等待，在采取行动之前考虑更多的经济报告。

US Jobless Rate Drops

The U.S. says its labor market advanced again in August, with its unemployment rate hitting the lowest point since late 2008 and employers adding another 169,000 jobs.

The government said Friday that the jobless rate last month edged down to 7.3 percent.

The number of new jobs in August showed the U.S. economy, the world's largest, is advancing, but only modestly and not as fast as in early 2013.

In its newest report, the government also revised its job count for June and July downward, saying that a combined 74,000 fewer jobs were added in the two months than first estimated.

The relatively weak job growth could complicate economic decisions for the country's central bank, the Federal Reserve.

Policy makers at the Fed have been weighing whether to cut the $85-billion-a-month purchase of securities they have been making to pump more money into the U.S. economy to boost its recovery.

The central bank has said that it might begin to pare back the purchases this year and end them by mid-2014. The policy makers are set to meet in two weeks and could order a cutback then, or wait and consider more economic reports before acting.
