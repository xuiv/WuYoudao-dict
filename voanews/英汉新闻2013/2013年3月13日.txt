**Papal Conclave Enters Second Day **

Black smoke has emerged from a small chimney atop the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City, signifying the morning of voting by Roman Catholic cardinals has not yet produced a new pope.

The 115 cardinals are voting on a successor to 85-year-old Pope Benedict, who resigned last month saying he does not have the strength to carry out his papal duties.

The College of Cardinals began its second day of deliberation Wednesday after a session of prayer.

Thousands of onlookers are gathered in St. Peter's Square to await a signal of black or white smoke to indicate whether a pope has been chosen.

When the cardinals agree on a successor to Benedict, white smoke will rise from the chimney and the bells of St. Peter's Basilica will ring.

**救援组织：叙利亚儿童成为“被遗忘的受害者”**

一份新报告说，将近200万叙利亚儿童需要人道救援，持续两年的冲突对他们吃饭、上学和保持卫生都造成影响。

救援组织“拯救儿童”星期三发表报告，强调指出叙利亚危机对儿童的影响，报告将这些儿童称为“被遗忘的受害者”。

拯救儿童组织说，学校和医院在叙利亚反政府武装和政府军的冲突中遭到破坏，该组织接触到的“几乎每个家庭”都表示不能安全地使用清洁的厕所。

拯救儿童组织的报告敦促叙利亚冲突各方允许为需要的人们提供人道救援，并停止在居民区使用爆炸装置。该组织还敦促交战各方停止征募少年兵。联合国调查人员本星期早些时候说，叙利亚政府军和反政府武装都在征募少年兵。

**Aid Group: Syrian Children 'Forgotten Victims' of Crisis**

A new report says nearly two million Syrian children need humanitarian assistance, after two years of conflict that has affected their ability to eat, go to school and have access to sanitation.

Aid group Save the Children released the report Wednesday highlighting the effect of the Syrian crisis on what it calls the "forgotten victims" of the fighting.

It says schools and hospitals have been damaged by clashes between rebels and Syrian government fighters, and that "nearly every family" the group spoke with said they could not safely access clean toilets.

The report calls on all parties in the conflict to allow humanitarian aid to get to those who need it, while ending the use of explosives in populated areas. It further urges fighters to end the recruitment of child soldiers - a practice United Nations investigators said earlier this week was being used by both the army and rebels.
