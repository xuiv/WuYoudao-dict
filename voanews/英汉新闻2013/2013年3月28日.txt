**塞浦路斯各家银行在严密控制下恢复营业**

塞浦路斯各地银行星期四（3月28日）按计划恢复营业。塞浦路斯各银行由于国家经济接近崩溃而关闭近两个星期。

塞浦路斯各家银行于当地时间中午12点开门，但是储户们早早地就在银行门外和大街上排起长龙，焦急地等待着银行开门取钱。

银行只营业6个小时，储户每天从自己的帐户取款额不得超过383美元。从这个地中海岛国前往其它国家的人所携带的金额不得超过3831美元。采取这些严格的限制措施是为了避免挤兑，挤兑可能导致金融系统出现灾难性瘫痪。

星期三晚间，银行周围采取了严密的保安措施，装甲卡车向各银行送去大量欧元现金，银行雇员在做恢复营业的准备工作。

塞浦路斯所有银行自3月16日以来一直关闭，与此同时，塞浦路斯政府为从欧洲邻国、欧洲中央银行以及国际货币基金组织得到130亿美元救助贷款而进行谈判。作为救助贷款协议的一部分，塞浦路斯同意对存款超过13万美元的未投保帐户征用40%或更多的金额，以帮助满足获得紧急援助资金的条件。

**Cyprus Reopens Banks Under Tight Controls**

Banks across Cyprus reopened as scheduled Thursday, nearly two weeks after being shutdown amid the island's near-economic collapse.

Depositors formed long lines on the sidewalks and streets outside their banks long before the doors were unlocked at noon local time ((10:00 GMT)), anxiously awaiting access to their accounts.

The banks will stay open for just six hours and people will only be allowed to withdraw $383 a day from their accounts. Travelers leaving the Mediterranean island can take no more than $3,831 to other countries. The strict restrictions were imposed to prevent a massive run on accounts that could trigger a catastrophic bank failure.

Security around was tight Wednesday evening as armored trucks delivered thousands of euros to the bank, as employees prepared to resume operations.

Cyprus banks have been closed since March 16 while the government negotiated a $13 billion bailout from European neighbors, the European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund. As part of the deal, Cyprus agreed to confiscate 40 percent or more from the biggest, uninsured accounts above $130,000 to help pay for the rescue.

**朝鲜半岛南北过境点在平壤切断热线后仍运作**

尽管平壤切断了便于协调朝鲜和韩国之间过境事宜的一个重要通讯渠道，过境点的局势紧张，但星期四过境事宜仍在照常进行。

朝鲜星期三切断了与首尔之间最后的一条军方热线，并声称既然“战争可能随时爆发”，联络已无必要。这条电话热线还用于安排韩国工人过境到位于朝鲜境内的一个联合工业园区。

平壤过去曾经切断这条军方热线，使韩国工人滞留开城工业园区。但工人们说，开城工业园区星期四照常运营。

目前，朝鲜半岛的紧张气氛达到几年来的最高点，朝鲜和得到美国支持的韩国都展示在军事上做好了准备。

在最近一次军力展示中，驻韩美军说，两架B-52隐形轰炸机星期四在韩国上空执行实弹训练任务。驻韩美军发表声明说，能够携带核弹头的B-52轰炸机从一个美国中西部基地飞到朝鲜半岛参加实弹演习，行程超过1万公里，随后返回美国本土，完成了这次持续性单项任务。

**Border Crossing Still Operating after NKorea Cuts Hotline with South**

A tense border crossing between North and South Korea was operating as usual Thursday, despite Pyongyang cutting a crucial communications link that helped coordinate passage at the border.

The North on Wednesday cut its last military hotline with Seoul, saying it was no longer necessary since "war may break out at any moment." The phone was also used to arrange passage for South Korean workers at a joint industrial complex in the North.

Pyongyang has in the past cut the military hotline, stranding South Korean workers at the complex. But workers ((such as this truck driver Park Chul-hee)) reported business as usual at the Kaesong industrial complex Thursday.

Tensions on the Korean peninsula are at their highest in years, with both the North and the U.S.-backed South demonstrating their military preparedness.

In the latest show of force, the U.S. Armed Forces Korea said two B-2 stealth bombers conducted a live-fire training mission over the South Thursday. A statement said the nuclear-capable bombers flew over 10,000 kilometers from a midwestern U.S. base to the Korean peninsula, conducted the firing drill, and returned to the continental U.S. in a "single, continuous mission."
