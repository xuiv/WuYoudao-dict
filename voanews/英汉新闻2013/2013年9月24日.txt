**奥巴马总统联大发言：世界比五年前更稳定**

美国总统奥巴马在纽约召开的联合国大会上发表讲话。他在讲话开始时说，虽然仍有危险，但世界局势比五年前更加稳定。

奥巴马说，在他任职美国总统期间所面对的一些最紧迫的挑战跟越来越彼此相连的全球经济以及从经济危机中复苏的努力有关。他说，那是“我们此生”所经历的最严重的经济危机。不过，他也提到了一些进展，包括创造新的就业机会、稳定全球金融体系和帮助民众脱贫。但是奥巴马说，这些进展是“脆弱的和不平等的”。

他还提到历时十年的伊拉克和阿富汗战争的结束。他说，美国目前正在从“长久立足战争”的状态中过渡出来，并且正在审议美国搜集情报的方式。


Obama: World More Stable Now than 5 Years Ago

U.S. President Barack Obama opened his speech to world leaders gathered for the United Nations General Assembly with the statement that the world is more stable now than five years ago, though dangers remain.

President Obama said some of the most urgent challenges he has faced during his tenure as U.S. leader have revolved around the increasingly integrated global economy and efforts to recover from the worst economic crisis "of our lifetime." But he noted progress, including the creation of new jobs, the stabilization of global financial systems and people being lifted out of poverty, though he called that progress "fragile and unequal."

He also noted the end of a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, saying the U.S. is now shifting away from a "perpetual war footing" and reviewing the way it gathers intelligence.

**青年党：激进分子仍在肯尼亚商厦扣押着人质**


索马里激进组织青年党说，他们的战斗人员仍在肯尼亚内罗毕的高档购物中心内扣押着人质。枪手从星期六开始攻击这座商厦并造成惨重伤亡。

青年党星期二发出的一系列推特短讯说，激进分子“坚守”在内罗毕的西门购物中心，商厦内死尸“无数”。

肯尼亚军方说，军队正在现场展开“扫尾”行动。肯尼亚警方则敦促民众不要理睬警方所说的青年党“宣传”。

早些时候，有关官员曾说，他们控制了这座购物中心，军队正在大楼内搜索任何还在楼内的人，所有的人质都已获救。

星期二拂晓时分，人们听到了枪声，星期二白天枪声再度响起。

青年党重复了发动袭击的原因。青年党发推说，当肯尼亚从索马里撤军时，“和平就会来到”西门购物中心。肯尼亚拒绝了青年党的要求。


Al-Shabab: Militants Still Holding Hostages Inside Kenyan Mall


The Somali militant group al-Shabab says its fighters are still holding hostages inside the Kenyan mall where gunmen began a deadly siege on Saturday.

The group said in a series of Twitter messages Tuesday that militants were "holding their ground" at the Westgate shopping center in Nairobi, and that a "countless" number of dead bodies were inside.

Kenya's military says it is conducting "mop up" operations at the site, while Kenya's police urged people to ignore what it called al-Shabab's "propaganda."

Earlier, officials had said they were in control of the mall with soldiers going through the building looking for anyone still inside, and that all of the hostages had been freed.

Fresh gunfire was heard around dawn Tuesday and again about three hours later.

Al-Shabab also repeated its stated reason for staging the attack, posting Tuesday that "peace will come" to the mall when Kenya removes its forces from Somalia. Kenya has rejected that demand.
