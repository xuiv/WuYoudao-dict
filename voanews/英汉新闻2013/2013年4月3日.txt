**朝鲜不准韩国工人进入开城工业园区**

朝鲜不准韩国工人进入位于南北分界线以北的联合工业园区，朝鲜半岛南北双方仅存的这一合作迹象前途未卜。

平壤星期三宣布，暂停准予韩国工人进入开城工业园区，但表示将准许目前仍停留在园区内的韩国工人离开。

韩国表示，未被告知不准进入开城工业园区的禁令将维持多久，但警告说，如果禁令维持下去，韩国工人将面临生活用品和食物短缺。韩国统一部发言人说，韩国工人的安全是首尔的首要考虑事项。

韩国国防部说，如果韩国工人的安全受到威胁，军事行动将是最后的选择。

平壤以往曾经阻挠韩国人进入或离开开城工业园区。该园区于2004年开始运营。但开城工业园区这次看来面临着最严重的威胁。开城工业园区每年为贫困的朝鲜带来大约20亿美元的贸易收入。

在开城工业园区工作的韩国人对当地的安全局势感到担忧。

在朝鲜做出这一决定的几小时前，美国国务卿克里警告平壤不要进一步对华盛顿及其盟友进行威胁挑衅。

**N. Korea Not Allowing S. Korean Workers Into Joint Industrial Zone**

North Korea is blocking entry of South Korean workers into a joint industrial zone just north of the border, jeopardizing the last remaining sign of cooperation between the two foes.

Pyongyang announced Wednesday it is suspending South Korean access to the
Kaesong industrial complex, but said it would allow the South Korean workers
at the facility to leave.

South Korea says it was not told how long the entry ban will last, but warns that, if it is prolonged, South Korean workers could run out of supplies and food. Unification Ministry spokesperson says the safety of its workers is Seoul's top priority.

Seoul's defense ministry says that military action is a last-resort option if the safety of the workers is threatened.

Pyongyang has previously blocked South Koreans from entering or exiting the complex, which opened in 2004. But this appears to be the most serious threat yet to the center, which provides about $2 billion a year in trade for the impoverished North.

South Koreans who work in Kaesong are expressing concern about their safety.

The move came just hours after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry warned Pyongyang against making further provocative threats against Washington and its allies.

**马来西亚总理解散议会 预计数周内举行选举**

马来西亚总理纳吉布已经解散议会，并准备举行选举。纳吉布所在的执政联盟已经当政将近60年，其地位可能在选举中受到挑战。

纳吉布星期三发表电视讲话，赞扬他的国民阵线联盟所取得的成就，并表示希望选举将对该联盟予以强大的授权。

分析人士预计，前副总理安华领导的三党联盟将在选举中获得有力的支持。在2008年选举中，这个反对派联盟从国民阵线联盟手中夺得的议席之多前所未有。

预计马来西亚选举委员会不久将开会确定投票日期，很可能是在几星期后。解散议会后，必须要在两个月内举行选举。

**Malaysia PM Dissolves Parliament; Elections Expected within Weeks**

Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has dissolved parliament, setting up elections that could challenge his ruling coalition that has been in power for nearly six decades.

During a televised speech Wednesday, Prime Minister Razak hailed the achievements of his National Front coalition, saying he hopes the elections will deliver it a strong mandate.

Analysts expect a strong showing from the three-party coalition of ex-deputy prime minister Anwer Ibrahim. The opposition alliance took an unprecedented number of seats from the National Front during 2008 polls.

The election commission is expected to meet soon to establish a date for the vote, which is likely to happen in the next few weeks. Elections must be held within two months of dissolving parliament.
