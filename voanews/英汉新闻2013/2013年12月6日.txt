South Africans Mourn Death of Nelson Mandela

South Africans are mourning the death of anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela, the country's first black president, who died Thursday at the age of 95.

Many woke to the news Friday, hours after President Jacob Zuma announced Mr. Mandela "passed on peacefully" in the company of his family.

Dressed in black, Mr. Zuma made the statement in a nationally televised address that South Africa "has lost its greatest son and our people have lost a father."

He said flags will be flown at half staff and Mr. Mandela will be given a state funeral, which is expected to follow a period of national mourning.

Scores of world leaders and celebrities are expected to travel to South Africa for the funeral of Mr. Mandela, who was respected around the world for his activism.

Crowds have already gathered outside Mr. Mandela's home in Johannesburg, where people sang, danced, and paid their respects in the South African tradition.

Mr. Mandela spent nearly three decades in prison for his role in fighting to end white minority rule and official discrimination against blacks in South Africa.

After his release, he emerged as a revered symbol of peace and reconciliation and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993. The following year, he became South Africa's first black president.

Mr. Mandela, who contracted tuberculosis during his nearly three decades of incarceration, was hospitalized repeatedly during the past several years, most recently for a recurring lung infection.

Biden Meets with South Korea President

U.S. Vice President Joe Biden has met with South Korean President Park Geun-Hye on the lastest stop of an Asian tour dominated by tensions over China's new Air Defense Identification Zone, or ADIZ.

Biden said at the presidential Blue House in Seoul on Friday that there should be no doubt about Washington's commitment to preserving balance in the region. Biden told reporters that, "The United States never says anything it does not do."

At a working lunch, President Park alluded to regional issues including territorial disputes with China, the threat from North Korea and diplomatic tensions with Japan.

Biden arrived in Seoul from Beijing, where he said China's ADIZ has created "significant apprehension" in the region.

The U.S., Japan and South Korea have all rejected the new zone in the East China Sea.

China says the zone is in accordance with international law and that the U.S. should take an "objective and fair attitude" about it.

Biden told a group of U.S. business leaders in Beijing Thursday he was "very direct" about the matter during his talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

But the vice president said conflict between Beijing and Washington was not inevitable, despite occasional disagreements.

Seoul is the last stop on Biden's week-long Asia tour.
