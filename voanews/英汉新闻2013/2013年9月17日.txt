**俄罗斯与西方在叙利亚化武袭击问题上仍有分歧**

俄罗斯和西方大国在谁是叙利亚化学武器袭击的凶手问题上仍然意见对立，不过各国继续共事，争取达成一项移除叙利亚化学武库的联合国决议。

俄罗斯外长拉夫罗夫星期二说，上个月发生在大马士革附近的袭击事件可能是反政府武装分子“挑起事端”，企图引来外国军事援助。

法国外长法比尤斯在莫斯科与俄罗斯外长会晤之后在联合记者会上说，联合国调查人员星期一提交的证据表明，部署化武的“似乎毫无疑问”是叙利亚政府军。

武器检查员向联合国安理会提交的报告没有分析袭击责任方是谁。不过美国和西方盟国引用报告中隐晦的证据说，叙利亚政府要对化武袭击负责，这些证据包括带有毒气的火箭的弹道轨迹。

Russia, West Remain Divided on Syria Gas Attack

Russia and Western powers remain divided on who was responsible for a chemical weapons attack in Syria, but are continuing to work together toward a United Nations resolution on the removal of Syria's chemical arsenal.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Tuesday the attack last month near Damascus was likely a "provocation" by rebels seeking to draw in outside military help.

His French counterpart, Laurent Fabius, told a joint news conference after their meeting in Moscow that evidence presented in a report by U.N. investigators released Monday "seems to leave no doubt" that Syrian forces were the ones who deployed chemical weapons.

The inspection report presented to the U.N. Security Council does not assess blame for the attack. But the report's underlying evidence, including the trajectory of poison-filled rockets, was cited by the United States and its Western allies as proof of the Syrian government's responsibility.

**美国当局：华盛顿海军设施枪击案嫌疑人是单独作案**

美国首都华盛顿当局说，在美国一个海军设施星期一发生的枪击案中，为一家军事承包商工作的一名信息技术人员是唯一的嫌疑人。枪击事件造成包括枪手在内的13人死亡。

事件过后几小时，华盛顿警察局长拉尼尔对记者说，嫌疑人是现年34岁的阿伦•亚历克西斯，他家住德克萨斯州沃斯堡，没有证据显示还有第二名嫌疑人。亚历克西斯开始行凶后不久与警察展开枪战，被警察击毙。

警方说，亚历克西斯凭一个有效身份证进入位于华盛顿的美国海军设施，当时他携带着一支军用自动步枪、一支霰弹枪和一把手枪，在海军海上系统指挥部内开枪。海上系统指挥部负责采购、修建和维护舰只和潜艇。大约3千人在那座建筑中工作，其中很多不是军人。

亚历克西斯出生于纽约，从2007年至2011年是美国海军预备役军人。媒体报道说，亚历克西斯曾两次因枪击事件被逮捕，一次是2004年在西雅图，另一次是2010年在沃斯堡。有人说，亚历克西斯性情暴躁。

Authorities: Suspected Gunman in Deadly Washington Shooting Acted Alone

Authorities in Washington, D.C. say an information technology employee working for a military contractor was the lone suspect in Monday's shooting rampage at a U.S. naval facility that left 13 people dead, including the gunman.

Washington Police Chief Cathy Lanier told reporters hours after the tragedy there was no evidence a second person was involved with Aaron Alexis, a 34-year-old resident of ((the southwestern city/state of)) Fort Worth, Texas, who was killed during a gun battle with police shortly after his shooting spree began.

Police say Alexis entered the U.S. Naval Yard in the nation's capitol with a valid identification card, armed with a military-style automatic assault rifle, a shotgun and a handgun, and opened fire inside the Naval Sea Systems Command, which is responsible for buying, building and maintaining ships and submarines. About 3,000 people work in the building, many of them civilians.

The New York City native served in the U.S. Navy as a reserve sailor from 2007 to 2011. News outlets say Alexis was arrested in two separate shooting incidents, once in 2004 in Seattle and the second in Fort Worth in 2010. He has been described as having problems controlling his anger.
