**China Shenzhou-10 spacecraft touched down safely**

China has completed its longest manned space mission yet, marking an important step toward the goal of building its own space station.

The return capsule of the Shenzhou-10 spacecraft touched down safely early Wednesday in China's remote Inner Mongolia region. The three astronauts aboard waved and smiled for after emerging from the capsule.

During their 15 days in space, the astronauts successfully docked with and carried out other tests on the Tiangong-1 experimental space module. China hopes the orbiting lab can serve as a prototype for a permanent space station that it hopes to build by 2020.

**澳前总理陆克文卷土重来赢回工党领袖职位**

澳大利亚前总理陆克文(Kevin Rudd)击败现任总理朱莉娅•吉拉德，赢得了工党领袖的选举。预计这将导致澳大利亚首位女总理告别政治舞台。

陆克文在星期三举行的议会党团投票中以57比45票赢得工党议员的支持，这意味着他将领导工党参加今年9月举行的大选。预计工党将在这次选举中惨败。

星期三早些时候，吉拉德挑战陆克文，临时宣布提前举行党内选举。她承诺，她如果败选，就将告别政坛。选举结束后，吉拉德没有就此立即发表评论。预计她将于星期四辞职，陆克文将取代她继任总理。

选举之前，陆克文的支持者据说准备另立党团，以推翻总理吉拉德。吉拉德是澳大利亚首位女总理。

陆克文曾于2007至2010年担任总理，后被吉拉德取代。

** Kevin Rudd won Labor Party leadership**

Australia's former leader Kevin Rudd has won a Labor Party leadership vote over Prime Minister Julia Gillard, in a move expected to result in the country's first female leader quitting politics.

Mr. Rudd won the support his fellow lawmakers 57 to 45 in a caucus vote Wednesday, meaning he will lead the party into September general elections in which it is expected to suffer heavy losses.

Mrs. Gillard challenged Mr. Rudd to the snap vote earlier Wednesday, promising to resign from politics if she lost. She made no immediate comment following the vote. She is expected to resign Thursday, with Mr. Rudd replacing her as prime minister.

The move comes after Mr. Rudd's supporters were said to be preparing a separate party caucus in an attempt to oust Mrs. Gillard, who was the country's first female prime minister.

Mr. Rudd served as prime minister from November 2007 until June 2010, when was ousted by Mrs. Gillard.
