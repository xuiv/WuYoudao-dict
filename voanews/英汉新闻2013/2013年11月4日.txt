**穆尔西咆哮公堂 以合法总统自居**

被推翻的埃及总统穆尔西拒绝接受对他的审判，他坚持称自己是埃及的“合法总统”。对穆尔西的审判在星期一开始。

穆尔西在7月被军队推翻后首次公开露面。他拒不从命。穆尔西不肯穿上被告一向要穿的白色囚服，审判开始的时间因此被推迟。

审判开始几分钟后，穆尔西及其同案被告又大声抗议，法官随后宣布暂时休庭。预计审判将在同天晚些时候恢复。

审判地点在开罗警官学院，另一位被推翻的埃及领导人穆巴拉克也在这里受过审。

审判地点外戒备森严，穆尔西的支持者聚集在外，抗议他们所说的非法审判。


Defiant Morsi Rejects Trial, Insists He Remains President



Ousted Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi has rejected the trial against him that began Monday, insisting that he is the country's "legitimate president."

In his first public appearance since the military pushed him from power in July, Mr. Morsi was defiant. The start of the trial was delayed because he refused to dress in the traditional white jumpsuit worn by defendants.

A judge then adjourned the trial minutes after it began because of protest chants by Mr. Morsi and his co-defendants. It was expected to resume later Monday.

The trial is being held at the same Cairo police academy where another ousted leader, Hosni Mubarak, has faced prosecution.

Security was heavy outside the venue, where a crowd of Mr. Morsi's supporters gathered to protest what they say in an illegitimate trial.

Chinese Nuclear Negotiator Arrives in North Korea

China's top official for the long-stalled six-party North Korean nuclear talks has arrived in Pyongyang.

The North's official Korean Central News Agency says Wu Dawei landed Monday, but did not provide further details.

China, which is North Korea's closest ally, has begun to express impatience with Pyongyang, and agreed to a tightening of U.N. sanctions following a North Korean nuclear test this year.

Wu's trip follows his talks with U.S. officials in Washington last week.

The visit also comes as the U.S. is preparing to host South Korean and Japanese officials for talks Wednesday on North Korea's nuclear program.

North Korea, which pulled out of six party-talks in 2009, has called for their resumption with no preconditions. Washington says North Korea needs to show it is serious about abandoning its pursuit of nuclear weapons before the United States will resume negotiations.
