**奥巴马敦促国会议员支持对叙打击**

美国总统奥巴马星期一与重要国会议员会晤，争取国会支持对叙利亚采取军事行动。

奥巴马计划星期一在白宫会晤重量级参议员约翰•麦凯恩，麦凯恩一直敦促奥巴马总统对叙利亚采取强有力的行动，甚至可能包括推翻叙利亚总统巴沙尔•阿萨德。

但是很多国会议员抱怀疑态度，他们对军队是否应当卷入叙利亚提出质疑。

美国政府官员星期日就有关情报向一些议员做了通报。情报显示，叙利亚军队上个月在大马士革城外向平民投放毒气，杀害了一千多人。

虽然有证据显示可能发生了化学武器袭击，但国际社会支持对叙利亚进行军事干预的呼声有所减弱，不过北约秘书长拉斯穆森星期一表示，必须采取行动。

到目前为止，只有法国和土耳其强烈支持美国以军事行动做出反应。

叙利亚的长期盟友俄罗斯星期一质疑美国有关叙利亚动用化学武器的证据是否可信。

俄罗斯外长拉夫罗夫还警告说，军事攻击只能使政治解决更加困难。

叙利亚政府否认动用了化学武器，他们指责反政府武装对叙利亚军队使用了毒气。

**Obama Pushes for Congressional Support of Syria Strike**

U.S. President Barack Obama will again make the case for military action in Syria when he speaks with key lawmakers.

Mr. Obama is scheduled to meet with prominent Senator John McCain at the White House Monday. McCain has long urged the president to take forceful action against Syria, possibly even removing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power.

But many U.S. lawmakers remain skeptical, questioning whether the military should be involved at all.

U.S. officials Sunday briefed some lawmakers on intelligence showing the Syrian military dropped poison gas on civilians outside Damascus last month, killing more than 1,000 people.

International support for military intervention in Syria, despite evidence of a possible chemical weapons attack, has been waning. But NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Monday something must be done.

Russia, a long-time Syrian ally, questioned Monday the credibility of U.S. evidence the Assad government used chemical weapons. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also cautioned that any military strike will only make it more difficult to find a political solution.
The Syrian government denies using chemical weapons and says the rebels have used poison gas against Syrian troops.

**日本可能将福岛核电站含有放射物质的水排放到海里**
日本核管理机构的负责人说，可能不得不将受损福岛核电站含有放射物质的水排放到海里。
日本原子能规制委员会主席田中俊一星期一对记者说，将把放射性污水过滤，把放射量减少到国际社会接受的限度以下，然后再排放到海里。
2011年的地震和海啸造成福岛核电站机组熔毁，之后日本工程技术人员一直设法将冷却核反应堆的水储存起来。管理福岛核电站的日本东京电力公司的官员上星期日宣布，一个连接另外两个核污水储存罐的管道有污水泄漏。
东京电力公司上星期六还说，他们发现有一个储存罐的辐射水平升高为每小时1800微西弗，足以导致受辐射的人死亡。
日本政府官员表示本周将宣布一系列解决危机的措施。

**Japanese Government to Release Radioactive Water from Fukushima into the Sea**

The head of Japan's nuclear regulatory agency says it is possible that radioactive water from the crippled Fukushima nuclear power plant will have to be released into the sea.

Nuclear Regulation Authority chairman Shunichi Tanaka told reporters Monday the toxic water would be filtered to bring the radiation levels below internationally accepted limits before it is discharged into the sea.

Engineers have been struggling to store water used to cool the plant's nuclear reactors, which sustained a meltdown after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Officials with Tokyo Electric Power Company, Fukushima's operator, announced Sunday that a pipe connecting two other tanks is leaking contaminated water.

Officials announced the day before that it had detected a potentially fatal level of 1,800 millisieverts per hour at one of the holding tanks.

Japanese government officials have suggested they will announce a set of measures this week aimed at resolving the crisis.
