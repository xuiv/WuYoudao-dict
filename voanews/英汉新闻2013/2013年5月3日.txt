**巴基斯坦调查贝.布托遇刺案的检察官遭枪杀**

巴基斯坦警方说，主持前总理贝.布托遇刺案和2008年印度孟买爆炸案调查的检察官在伊斯兰堡被枪杀。

乔杜里•佐勒菲卡尔星期五在开车前往法院的途中遭到骑摩托的杀手枪击，身中数弹死亡。他的保镖受伤，一名女性路人在他的汽车失控后撞击死亡。枪手逃逸。

佐勒菲卡尔正在调查贝.布托2007年12月在拉瓦尔品第被暗杀的事件。当时自动流亡海外的布托刚刚回国几个星期。目前还没有任何人因贝.布托被杀而被定罪或判刑入狱。警方说，佐勒菲卡尔遭到枪击时正前去参加与布托遇刺有关的听证。

前军事统治者穆沙拉夫被控对贝.布托的死亡负责。

佐勒菲卡尔同时也在调查孟买爆炸案。那次爆炸造成166人死亡。印度指责巴基斯坦激进派伊斯兰团体虔诚军制造了那些爆炸袭击。

联合国2010年的一份报告说，对贝.布托死因的任何可信的调查，都不应当排除巴基斯坦军方和安全机关成员涉案的可能性。

**Pakistani Prosecutor in Bhutto Case Gunned Down**

Police in Pakistan say the lead prosecutor investigating the murder of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, and the 2008 bombing attacks in Mumbai, India, has been shot dead in Islamabad.

Chaudry Zulfikar was shot multiple times Friday by attackers on a motorbike. His bodyguard was wounded and a passer-by was killed when his car hit her. Zulfikar's attackers fled.

Zulfikar was investigating the December 2007 killing of Ms. Bhutto, which took place in Rawalpindi just weeks after she returned to the country from self-imposed exile. No one has been convicted or sent to prison for her death. Police said he was headed to a hearing related to the Bhutto attack when he was killed.

Former military ruler Pervez Musharraf is accused in the Bhutto case.

Zulfikar was also investigating the Mumbai attacks, in which 166 people were killed. India blames the radical Pakistani Islamic group Lashkar-e-Taiba for the attacks.

A U.N. report in 2010 said any credible investigation of Ms. Bhutto's death should not rule out the possibility that members of Pakistan's military and security establishment were involved.

**孟加拉国厂房坍塌死亡人数超过500**

孟加拉国警方逮捕了曾经警告一栋8层楼厂房出现裂痕的工程师。 上个星期（4月24日）大楼坍塌造成的死亡人数已经上升到500多人。

阿卜杜尔•拉扎克•汗上个星期在大楼坍塌的前一天警告说，大楼出现裂痕。警方说，他们逮捕这名工程师，是因为他参与了这座大楼原来的施工。自从4月24日大楼坍塌以来警方已经逮捕了总共9名与坍塌有关的涉案人员。被逮捕的其中包括楼房的主人，几家制衣厂的老板以及负责大楼施工的工程师。

警方星期五说，死亡人数已经上升到501人。在此之前，救援人员昨天晚上从废墟中又找到更多的尸体。

由于在达卡附近外这栋大楼坍塌，而被停工一个星期后的孟加拉国纺织业星期四又重新开工。

在制衣厂工人返回工作的同时，大楼坍塌的这个萨瓦市的市长星期四被停职。当地官员说，穆罕默德.里法特.乌拉因涉案孟加拉国最大的工业灾难将受到起诉。

与此同时，救援人员继续使用重型设备清理坍塌现场。官员预计，由于仍有150人下落不明，死亡人数还会上升。这座制衣厂大楼坍塌时，当时里边有3000多人。

**Bangladesh Factories Death Toll Passes 500**

Police in Bangladesh have arrested the engineer who warned of cracks in an eight-story factory complex that collapsed last week（April 24）, killing more than 500 people.

Abdur Razzak Khan last week warned of cracks in the building a day before it collapsed. Police say they arrested him because of his role in the original construction of the building. This brings to nine the number of people arrested since the factory collapsed April 24. Among the detainees were the owner of the building, the owners of several factories housed inside, and engineers responsible for its construction.

Police said Friday the death toll has risen to 501, as new bodies were discovered in the ruins overnight.

On Thursday, the nation's textile industry reopened, a week after a work shutdown prompted by the building collapse near Dhaka.

The mayor of Savar, the site of the collapse, was suspended from office Thursday as garment workers returned to their jobs. Local officials say charges will be brought against Mohammad Refat Ullah in connection with the country's largest industrial disaster.

Meanwhile, rescue workers are continuing to use heavy equipment to clear the site. Officials expect the number of victims to rise as 150 people remain unaccounted for. More than 3,000 people were in the building when it collapsed.
