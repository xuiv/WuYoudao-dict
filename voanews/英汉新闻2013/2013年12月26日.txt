**安倍晋三参拜有争议的靖国神社**

日本首相安倍晋三参拜了靖国神社，而日本的很多邻国将靖国神社视为日本军国主义历史的象征。

中国和韩国立即对安倍参拜靖国神社的做法予以谴责。中韩两国都是日本帝国主义侵略的受害者。自2006年以来，这是日本现任首相首次参拜靖国神社。

安倍晋三对星期四参拜靖国神社的政治含义进行淡化处理，声称此举并非有意伤害邻国的感情，而是对战争死难者表示敬意。

靖国神社供奉着将近250万日本战争亡灵牌位，其中包括14名二战战犯。

中国外交部发言人秦刚立即表示，中国人民完全不能接受安倍参拜靖国神社的做法，并要求东京“对自己的侵略历史进行反思”。

中国官方的新华社说，中国星期四将在北京和东京对安倍参拜靖国神社表示严正抗议。

韩国文化体育观光部长官刘震龙说，安倍参拜靖国神社是“不合时宜”的，并表示此举将损害韩日关系。

美国通过驻日使馆发表声明，对日本领导人采取这一举动表示“失望”，并说这种做法将加剧日本与邻国之间的紧张关系。

Japan's Abe Visits Controversial War Shrine

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has paid respects at a Tokyo war shrine that many of Japan's neighbors see as a symbol of its militaristic past.

The visit to the Yasukuni Shrine, the first by a sitting Japanese prime minister since 2006, was quickly condemned by South Korea and China, both victims of imperialist Japan's aggression.

Mr. Abe downplayed the political impact of the Thursday visit, saying it was not meant to hurt the feelings of Japan's neighbors, but was a sign of respect for his country's war dead.

The Shinto shrine honors Japan's nearly 2.5 million war dead, including 14 convicted World War II war criminals.

China's foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang immediately slammed Mr. Abe's visit as "absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese people" and demanded Tokyo "reflect on its history of aggression."

The Xinhua news agency also said China will "make solemn representations" in Beijing and Tokyo on Thursday to protest the visit.

South Korea's minister of culture, sports and tourism, Yoo Jinryong, labeled the move as "anachronistic" and said it will hurt South Korea-Japan ties.

The U.S., a strong ally of Tokyo, said in a statement via its embassy in Japan that it is "disappointed" the country's leaders have undertaken an action that will "exacerbate tensions" with its neighbors.


**泰国爆发冲突 选举委员会要求推迟选举**

泰国选举委员会要求无限期推迟英拉总理宣布提前举行的选举。英拉试图通过提前举行选举来摆脱目前的政治危机。星期四，泰国政治危机再度引发暴力。

泰国选举委员会发表声明说，政府与抗议者之间没有建立起和平关系。几星期来，抗议者一直要求英拉辞职，将权力转交一个未经选举产生的委员会。

星期四早些时候，警察向试图干扰选举准备工作的反政府抗议者发射催泪弹和橡皮子弹。

抗议民众无视警方的警告，冲入曼谷的一个体育场，从而引发冲突。候选人们在该体育场登记参加定于明年2月2日举行的选举。

抗议者向警察投掷石块，但后来撤退，选举准备工作恢复正常。有关官员说，至少有32名抗议者在冲突中受伤。

泰国警方发言人说，也有三名警察受伤。

Amid Clashes, Thailand's Election Commission Calls for Delay in Vote

Thailand's election commission has requested the indefinite postponement of an early vote, which was called for by Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra as a way out of the country's political crisis, which turned violent again Thursday.

In a statement, the commission cited a lack of peace between the government and protesters, who for weeks have demanded that Prime Minister Yingluck step down and hand power to an unelected council.

Earlier Thursday, police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at anti-government protesters who were trying to disrupt election preparations.

The clashes began after protesters ignored police warnings and stormed a sports stadium in Bangkok where officials were registering candidates for the scheduled February 2 vote.

The protesters hurled rocks at police, but later withdrew and the election preparations continued as usual. Officials said at least 32 protesters were hurt during the incident.

Police spokesman Piya Uthayo said three policemen also were injured.
