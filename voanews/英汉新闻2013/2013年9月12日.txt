**克里将与俄罗斯外长讨论消除叙利亚化武威胁方案**

美国国务卿克里和俄罗斯外交部长拉夫罗夫星期四将在日内瓦举行会谈，讨论俄罗斯提出的消除叙利亚化学武器威胁方案。

克里和拉夫罗夫均未透露有关这项方案的细节。这一方案的要点是叙利亚总统阿萨德将其全部化武交付联合国销毁。与此同时，美国将搁置对叙利亚进行军事打击的计划。

会谈举行之前，俄罗斯总统普京在纽约时报发表评论文章，强调必须通过联合国进行运作，而不能单方面对叙利亚采取军事行动。

美国总统奥巴马指责叙利亚政府军上月在大马士革附近对平民使用毒气。他说，地中海海域的美国军舰继续停留在目前的位置，以迫使叙利亚当局执行协议。

克里曾经表示，达成消除叙利亚化武威胁的任何协议都将是“极其困难”的。

**Kerry, Lavrov to Work Out Plan for Syria's Chemical Weapons**

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov are meeting Thursday in Geneva to work on Russia's plan to end the threat posed by Syria's chemical weapons.

Neither Kerry nor Lavrov have given any details of the proposal. It involves President Bashar al-Assad's government giving up all of its chemical weapons to the United Nations to have them destroyed. At the same time, the United States would set aside plans for a military strike.

Ahead of the meeting, Russian President Vladimir Putin stressed in a New York Times opinion piece the need to work through the United Nations and not conduct unilateral military action in Syria.

President Barack Obama has blamed Syrian forces for using poison gas against civilians last month near Damascus. He says U.S. ships in the Mediterranean region are holding their current positions, to keep pressure on the Syrians to live up to any agreement.

Kerry has said reaching any agreement to remove the chemical-weapons threat in Syria will be "exceedingly difficult."

**美韩研究所：朝鲜核反应堆可能恢复运作**

华盛顿的一个研究机构说，朝鲜很可能重新启动了一座钚反应堆，或许平壤正在履行自己的誓言，扩大其核武器项目。

约翰•霍普金斯大学的美韩研究所根据最近的卫星图片做出了上述结论。卫星图片显示，朝鲜主要的宁边核设施反应堆附近的一座建筑里冒出白色气体。

按照一项以援助换去核化协议，这座反应堆于2007年关闭。但平壤今年4月警告说，将全面恢复宁边核设施的运作，以便从“数量和质量”两方面增强其核能力。

美韩研究所的报告说，从8月31日拍摄到的商业卫星图片来看，那座建筑中冒出气体的量及颜色显示反应堆正在运作。

韩国官员说，他们仍在努力寻找这座反应堆是否启动的证据。

**NKorea Nuke Reactor Likely Restarted: Group**

A Washington-based research group says North Korea has likely restarted a plutonium reactor, possibly making good on a pledge to expand its nuclear weapons program.

The U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University based its conclusion on recent satellite photos that appear to show white steam emerging from a building near the reactor at the North's main Yongbyon nuclear complex.

The reactor was shut down in 2007 under an aid-for-disarmament deal. But in April, Pyongyang warned it would restart all operations at Yongbyon to boost its nuclear force in both "quantity and quality."

The institute's researchers say the color and the volume of the white steam seen emerging from the building in the August 31 commercial satellite photos suggest the reactor has been put back into operation.

South Korean officials say they are still working to find out if the reactor has been restarted.
