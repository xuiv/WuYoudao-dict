**埃及临时元首就任 穆尔西被军队拘捕**

埃及临时国家元首宣誓就职，同时，当局似乎开始镇压穆尔西的支持者。穆尔西是埃及第一位民选总统，他在一天前被军队推翻。

星期四，埃及宪法法院院长阿德勒•曼苏尔在国家电视台转播的一次仪式上宣誓就任临时总统。他随后誓言捍卫埃及革命的价值观。

在埃及宪法法院外，反对穆尔西的人高呼“埃及万岁”，军警则在关注支持穆尔西的人举行的抗议活动。

在被军方拘押之前，穆尔西对军队提出批评。他说，军队的行动等于是“全面政变”。他敦促埃及人对军队干政说不。不过，穆尔西所在的穆斯林兄弟会及其政治分支自由与正义党所属的官员已在当局的密切注视之下。

埃及检察官办公室星期四向300名穆斯林兄弟会成员发出了逮捕令，包括领导人巴迪和沙特尔。有关官员说，巴迪和沙特尔因为与兄弟会开罗总部外爆发冲突期间有八名抗议者丧生事件有关联而受到通缉。

**Egypt Installs Interim Leader, Morsi Detained**

Egypt has sworn in an interim leader as officials begin what appears to be a crackdown on supporters of the country's first democratically elected president - a day after his ouster by the military.

The chief justice of Egypt's Supreme Court, Adly Mansour, took the oath of office as interim president Thursday in a ceremony broadcast on state television. After, he vowed to uphold the values of the revolution.

Outside Egypt's Constitutional Court, opponents of deposed president Mohamed Morsi chanted "Long live Egypt," while police and soldiers kept watch over protests by Morsi supporters.

Before being taken into military custody, Mr. Morsi criticized the army, saying its actions amounted to a "full coup." He urged Egyptians to reject the military's intervention. But already, officials with Mr. Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood and its political wing, the Freedom and Justice Party, are coming under scrutiny.

The Egyptian prosecutor's office Thursday issued arrest warrants for 300 Muslim Brotherhood members, including leaders Mohammed Badie and Khairat el-Shater. Officials said Badie and Shater are wanted in connection with the deaths of eight protesters in clashes outside the group's Cairo headquarters.

**韩国建议就联合工业园区进行谈判**

韩国建议就重开位于朝鲜境内的联合工业园区与朝鲜进行谈判。

韩国统一部建议星期六在南北交界的板门店村举行低层级的谈判。

今年4月，持续数周不断加剧的朝韩紧张局面，导致开城工业园区沦为牺牲品，继而关闭。

朝鲜方面尚未对此提议做出回应。但是平壤方面星期三表示，将允许韩国商人前往园区检查工厂设备。

朝韩双方上个月曾试图就重开城园区进行谈判，但双方在派谁作谈判代表方面有争议，致使谈判被取消。

开城工业园区是朝鲜重要的财政收入来源，也是朝鲜半岛南北双方硕果仅存的合作标志。

**S Korea Proposes Talks with North on Joint Factory**

South Korea has proposed talks with North Korea on re-opening a stalled joint industrial complex in the North.

Seoul's Unification Ministry suggested the low-level talks be held Saturday at the Panmunjom truce village on the two countries' border.

The Kaesong industrial complex has been closed since April, when it fell victim to weeks of heightened inter-Korean tension.

North Korea has not responded to the proposal. But on Wednesday, Pyongyang said it would allow South Korean business people to inspect their equipment at the facility.
The two Koreas tried to hold talks aimed at re-opening Kaesong last month, but they were canceled following a disagreement over who would represent each side.

The factory was an important source of revenue for North Korea and served as one of the last remaining signs of cooperation between Seoul and Pyongyang.
