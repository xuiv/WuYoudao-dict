Iran, World Powers Set for Talks on Nuclear Issue

World leaders hold nuclear talks Thursday with Iran's top diplomat, amid fresh signs Tehran is looking to negotiate a settlement to the dispute.

The meeting on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly is aimed at restarting the so-called P5+1 nuclear talks, which were last held in April. It will mark the highest level interaction in six years between Washington and Tehran, as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and his Iranian counterpart Javad Zarif attend the meeting, along with officials from Britain, France, China, Russia and Germany.

The talks comes a day after Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said he wants a deal with the West on his country's nuclear program in three to six months.

President Rouhani told the Washington Post Wednesday the "only way forward" is for a timeline to be inserted into the talks, saying a quicker deal is "more beneficial to everyone."

Mr. Rouhani also said Iran is willing to take unspecified transparency measures to show its uranium enrichment program is peaceful.

Son of Chinese Military Singers Gets 10 Years for Gang Rape

The teenage son of two well-known Chinese military singers has been convicted of gang rape and sentenced to 10 years in prison.

A Beijing court Thursday found 17-year-old Li Tianyi and four others guilty of sexually assaulting a woman at a hotel in the capital in February.

Li argued he was drunk and not aware of what happened with the woman, whom the boys met at a Beijing hotel. His family said it was a case of prostitution.

But the court found Li dragged the woman into the hotel, demanded she disrobe and was the first to forcibly have sex with her.

Only one of the five defendants was an adult. The sentences against the others ranged from three to 12 years in jail.

The case was closely watched in China, where many are outraged at over the behavior of China's elite leaders, who are often viewed as corrupt.

Li's father, General Li Shuangjiang of the People's Liberation Army ((PLA)), has gained popularity by singing patriotic songs on television. His mother is also a famous singer in the PLA.
