**China's Government Promises Improvements As Congress Opens **

China's government promised to fight corruption, improve the environment and grow the economy as its annual parliamentary session got underway Tuesday.

Thousands of delegates from across the country have gathered amid heavy security in Beijing for the 13-day session of the National People's Congress that will complete China's once-a-decade leadership change.

Outgoing Premier Wen Jiabao delivered his last government work report at the opening session. He said China faces a difficult task in correcting China's unbalanced economic growth and income disparity.

Mr. Wen said the economic growth target for China this year is 7.5 percent, similar to last year, and that the government will fight to curb inflation. Defense spending will increase by almost 11 percent.

During the meeting of the largely ceremonial congress, Chinese Communist Party chief Xi Jinping will formally take over the presidency from Hu Jintao. Li Keqiang will succeed Mr. Wen as prime minister.

**联合国安理会将讨论制裁朝鲜问题**

联合国安理会星期二将举行会议，讨论针对朝鲜最近进行核试验而对其实施新制裁的问题。

在举行这次闭门会议之前，外交官们透露美国和中国已经就平壤上月进行核试验而对其实施制裁达成初步协议。这是平壤进行的第三次核试验，也是当量最大的一次。

外交官们星期一晚间对记者说，他们希望联合国安理会能在本星期结束之前就有关决议案进行表决。目前还不清楚这项决议草案的具体内容。

安理会此前一致谴责平壤2月12号进行核试验严重违反了联合国针对朝鲜核项目以及导弹项目的制裁规定。平壤说，进行核试验是针对其主要敌人美国。

**UN Security Council to Discuss North Korea Sanctions**

The United Nations Security Council is meeting Tuesday to discuss new sanctions in response to North Korea's latest nuclear test.

The closed-door meetings come as diplomats report the United States and China have reached a tentative deal to punish Pyongyang for last month's test, its third and most powerful yet.

Diplomats told reporters late Monday they hope the council will be able to vote on a resolution by the end of the week. Details of the draft resolution were not immediately available.

The Security Council already unanimously condemned the February 12 nuclear test as a "grave violation" of existing U.N. sanctions on North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. Pyongyang said its test was aimed at its "arch-enemy," the United States.
