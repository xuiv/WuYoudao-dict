**美国B-52轰炸机挑战中国防空识别区**

美国军方无视中国为从日本手中夺取有争议岛屿控制权而设立的防空区，派出两架B-52轰炸机从东海有争议岛屿附近飞过。
中国国防部星期三说，对美军轰炸机的飞行进行了全程监视，并及时对其加以确认。中国国防部警告说，中国有能力实施对该地区空域的有效控制。
美国国防部星期一曾说，北京没有立即对美军轰炸机的飞行做出反应。在此两天前，北京宣布设立防空识别区。中国警告说，所有飞机在进入该空域之前，必须说明身份，并服从北京的所有命令。
美国官员说，美军轰炸机星期一的飞行是计划已久的例行训练。但分析人士说，这一举动是一个明确信号，显示华盛顿不承认中国试图对该地区所做的控制。

US B-52 Bombers Challenge China Air Defense Zone

The U.S. military has flown two unarmed B-52 bombers near disputed islands in the East China Sea, defying an attempt by China to wrest control of the territory from Japan.

China's defense ministry said Wednesday it monitored "the entire course of the flights and identified them in a timely way." It warned "China is capable of exercising effective control" over the area.

The Pentagon said the Monday flights did not trigger an immediate response from Beijing, which two days earlier declared the airspace part of a new air defense zone. China warned all aircraft to identify themselves before entering the area and to obey all orders from Beijing.

U.S. officials describe the Monday flights as part of long-planned and routine training missions. But analysts say it was a clear message that Washington will not recognize China's attempt to establish control over the area.

Many of the dozens who gathered at the airport say they are excited to finally meet the Nobel laureate.
