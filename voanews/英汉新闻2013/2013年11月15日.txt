**菲律宾政府为其救灾工作辩护**

菲律宾政府为其救援台风“海燕”灾民的努力进行辩护。这场致命风暴侵袭菲律宾的一星期后，很多灾民只得到极少救助，或根本得不到救援。

菲律宾内政部长罗哈斯星期五说，面对如此局面，无论行动怎样迅速都是不够的。罗哈斯在灾情惨重的塔克洛班市说，灾民马上需要大量救助，但救援物资还不能进入所有灾区。

菲律宾救灾事务主管罗萨里奥星期五对记者说，官方统计的风灾死亡人数已经上升到3621人。

与此同时，美国海军星期四展开大规模救援行动。美国航空母舰“乔治•华盛顿号”以及七艘补给舰开始向塔克洛班运送水和紧急救灾物资。此外，大吨位医疗舰“仁慈号”也在紧急准备驶离美国，预计将在数星期内与英国航母“光辉号”一道加入救援舰群。

Philippines Defending Typhoon Relief Efforts

The Philippine government is defending its efforts to deliver assistance to victims of Typhoon Haiyan, many of whom have received little or no assistance since the deadly storm struck a week ago.

Interior Secretary Mar Roxas said Friday that in a situation like this, nothing is fast enough. Speaking in the city of devasted city of Tacloban, he said that the need is massive, immediate and not everyone can be reached.

Disaster relief chief, Eduardo del Rosario, told reporters Friday that the official death toll from the storm has risen to 3,621.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy launched a huge relief operation Thursday.

The aircraft carrier USS George Washington and a contingent of seven supply ships began delivering water and emergency rations to Tacloban. The giant hospital ship USS Mercy also is making emergency preparations to depart the United States, and is expected to join the emergency flotilla within weeks, along with the British carrier HMS Illustrious.


**据报美国中情局搜集国际资金转账记录**

两家美国报纸报道说，美国中央情报局搜集有关国际资金转账的记录，而中情局实施这一项目的依据也是美国国家安全局据以搜集电话和互联网通讯记录的法律。

纽约时报和华尔街日报星期五报道说，不肯透露姓名的前任及现任美国官员证实了这一项目的存在。

报道说，美国于2001年9月11日遭受恐怖袭击后，根据爱国法可以实施监视金融交易记录的项目。

纽约时报在报道中提及从事电汇转账业务的西联公司。西联没有证实该公司参与了监视项目，只表示该公司遵守联邦法律，而有关法律要求银行报告可疑的汇款。

Reports: CIA Collecting International Money Transfer Records

Two U.S. newspapers are reporting the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency is collecting records of international money transfers, using the same law the National Security Agency used to collect telephone and Internet records.

The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that former and current U.S. officials, speaking anonymously, confirmed the existence of the program.

The reports say the financial transactions program is covered under the Patriot Act enacted after the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States.

The wire transfer company Western Union was mentioned in the Times report. Western Union did not confirm its participation in the program, saying only that it complies with federal laws, which require banks to report suspicious transactions.
