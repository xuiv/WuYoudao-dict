Three Americans Win Nobel Economics Prize

Three American economists were awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for their work on determining how asset prices change over time.

The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, in a statement Monday, named Eugene Fama, Lars Peter Hansen and Robert Shiller as recipients of the 2013 award for their "empirical analysis of asset prices."

The academy said that while it is hard to predict the price of stocks and bonds over the next few days or weeks, the work by these economists make it possible to foresee the broad course of these prices over longer periods, such as the next three to five years.

Fama and Hansen are professors at the University of Chicago, in Illinios, while Shiller teaches at Yale University in Connecticut.

**印度踩踏事件造成至少110人丧生**


印度中央邦达基亚地区通往一座偏远的印度教神庙的桥上发生踩踏事件，造成至少110人死亡。印度中部地区的官员说，已下令对这起事件展开司法调查。

有关当局说，星期天的踩踏事故还造成1百人受伤。

目击者说，那座桥的一些栏杆断折，于是出现桥梁将要垮塌的传言，造成信徒们的恐慌，随后发生踩踏事件。

一些信徒被其他人踩死，另一些人掉进或跳到信德河里被淹死。

当地媒体说，多达50万信徒在拉坦加神庙聚会，欢庆为期10天的民间纳瓦拉特拉节。踩踏事件发生时，许多人已经进入神庙里面。

目击者说，警察试图用警棍控制人群，结果引起许多人恐慌，使局面更加恶化。


Stampede Near Indian Hindu Temple Kills 110

Officials in central India have ordered a judicial inquiry into what caused the stampede on a bridge leading to a remote Hindu temple in Madhya Pradesh state that killed at least 110 people.

Authorities say 100 people were injured Sunday in the incident.

Witnesses say pilgrims panicked and began to stampede after some railings on the bridge broke, spurring rumors the bridge would collapse.

Some devotees were crushed to death under the feet of fellow worshippers, while others drowned after falling or jumping into the Sindh River.

Local media said as many as 500,000 devotees had gathered to celebrate the popular 10-day Navaratra festival at the Ratangarh temple. Many were already inside when the stampede took place.

Witnesses said the situation was made worse by police attempting to control the crowd with batons.
