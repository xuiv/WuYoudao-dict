US Carrier Group to Arrive in Philippines Wednesday

The USS George Washington arrives Wednesday in the typhoon-hit central Philippines to help bring aid to many remain who remain desperate for food and other basic necessities.

The aircraft carrier is helping rush emergency supplies to the city of Tacloban, which was almost completely destroyed Friday by one of the strongest typhoons ever recorded.

The carrier is part of a team of ships that will be able to produce millions of liters of drinking water daily. They are also carrying helicopters and other special aircraft needed to bring life-saving supplies to remote areas.

VOA's Steve Herman, speaking from Manila, says the situation is still "quite grim" in Tacloban, but that relief will soon start flowing faster.
