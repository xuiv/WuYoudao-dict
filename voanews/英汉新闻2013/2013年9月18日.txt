**朝鲜呼吁无条件重启六方会谈**

朝鲜再次呼吁在不设先决条件的情况下恢复有关其核项目的多国会谈。

星期三，平壤第一副外相金桂冠在北京举行的纪念六方会谈启动10周年论坛会议上做出上述表示。

朝鲜2009年退出六方会谈，此后进行了两次核试验，从而导致联合国扩大了对朝鲜的制裁。美国拒绝重启六方会谈，除非平壤显示放弃其核项目的意愿。

但朝鲜首席核谈判代表金桂冠说，设定这种先决条件会导致“不信任”。他表示，紧张局势加剧是美国“对朝鲜的敌意”造成的。

中国外交部长王毅也表示，所有各方应当致力于重启六方会谈。

六方会谈的参与国是朝鲜、韩国、美国、日本、中国和俄罗斯。会谈的目的是争取朝鲜以放弃其核项目换取援助。

*NKorea Calls for Six Party Talks Without Preconditions*


North Korea is renewing its call for the resumption of multi-nation talks on its nuclear program without preconditions.

Pyongyang's first vice foreign minister, Kim Kye Gwan, made the comments Wednesday at a forum in Beijing marking the 10th anniversary of the six-party nuclear talks.

The North abandoned the talks in 2009 and has since conducted two nuclear tests, prompting expanded United Nations sanctions. The United States has ruled out the talks' resumption unless Pyongyang shows a willingness to give up its nuclear program.

But Kim, the North's chief nuclear envoy, said attaching such preconditions causes "mistrust." He blamed Washington's "hostility toward North Korea" for increased tensions.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi also said that "all parties should be devoted to restarting the six-party talks."

The six-party talks involved North Korea, South Korea, the U.S., Japan, China, and Russia. They were aimed at getting the North to abandon its nuclear program in exchange for aid.
