**缅甸政府与克钦族叛军重启谈判**

缅甸开始与克钦族反政府武装展开新一轮和平谈判，旨在达成在北部克钦邦实现全面停火的协议。

联合国缅甸特使维贾伊•南比亚尔和几位中国外交官出席了星期二在克钦邦首府密支那举行的会议。在两小时会谈中，双方都提交了有关建立一个委员会以监督停火协议并进行政治对话的方案。

缅甸政府首席谈判代表吴昂民说，这次会议有助于为在今年晚些时候与所有少数民族叛乱组织达成全面停火协议扫清障碍。
自缅甸军队与克钦族独立军于将近两年前重新开战以来，这是在缅甸境内首次举行的会谈。此前在中国举行的几轮谈判未能达成任何协议。

克钦族独立军指挥官关茂说，本次会议的主要目的是为政府与克钦族今后的对话设置标准。
**Burmese Government Resumes Talks With Kachin Rebels **

Burma has begun a new round of peace talks with Kachin rebels aimed at reaching a comprehensive cease-fire agreement in the northern state.

The United Nations special envoy for Burma, Vijay Nambiar, and several Chinese diplomats observed the meeting Tuesday in the Kachin state capital of Myitkyina. During the two-hour talks, both sides submitted proposals for creating a committee to monitor a cease-fire agreement and to conduct political dialogue.

Top government negotiator U Aung Min said the meeting could help clear the way for a comprehensive cease-fire agreement with all of the country’s armed ethnic rebel groups later this year.

The talks are the first held inside Burma since fighting between the country’s military and the Kachin Independence Army resumed nearly two years ago. Several rounds of negotiations held in China failed to produce an agreement.

Kachin Army General Guan Maw said the main purpose of the conference is to set the standard for future dialogues between the government and the Kachin people.
**奥巴马将向中国提出网络安全问题**

中国国家媒体说，中国军队下月将举行一次军事演习，以检验新型战力，包括运用数字化技术的部队。

新华社星期三报道说，这次军演将是中国军队首次重点检验用于信息战的数字化战斗部队。

在中国宣布这一消息之际，预计美国总统奥巴马下星期同中国国家主席习近平会谈时将提出网络安全问题，最近有报道说，美国关键的国防网络遭到攻击。

美国官员没有就最新的有关报道发表评论。不过白宫发言人卡尼说，他可以可以肯定，奥巴马和习近平在加州会晤时将讨论网络安全问题。卡尼说，这个问题是奥巴马政府关注的关键问题，美国官员在同中方各级官员会晤时都提出这一问题。

华盛顿邮报星期一公布了一份秘密防务报告的部分章节，其中指责中国网络间谍破坏美国某些最敏感和尖端的武器系统。

这份报告的保密章节列举了20多起导弹防御及其他武器系统遭到中国黑客攻击的情况，其中许多攻击以前未曾报道过。

中国坚决否认卷入了黑客行动，并且反唇相讥，指责美国骇客攻击了中国的几个军事网站。

**Obama to Raise Cybersecurity Concerns with China**

China's state news agency says the Chinese army will conduct an exercise next month to test new types of combat forces, including units using digital technology.

Xinhua reported Wednesday the drill marks the first time China's military will focus on digitalized combat forces to be used in "informationalized war."

The announcement of the digitalized combat forces comes as U.S. President Barack Obama is expected to talk about cybersecurity next week with Chinese President Xi Jinping, amid fresh reports of cyber attacks on critical American defense systems.

U.S. officials have not commented on the latest reports, but White House spokesman Jay Carney says he is certain cybersecurity will be discussed when President Obama meets with President Xi in California. Carney calls the issue a "key concern" for the administration that U.S. officials raise at every level in meetings with Chinese counterparts.

Monday, The Washington Post newspaper published parts of a confidential defense report accusing Chinese cyberspies of compromising some of the most sensitive and advanced U.S. weapons systems.

Classified sections of the report outlined more than two-dozen breaches of missile defense and other weapons systems by Chinese hackers, including many that had not been previously reported.

China firmly denies involvement in the hacking attempts. It has also returned the accusation, saying U.S.-based hackers have attacked several Chinese military websites.
