Pakistani Girl Shot by Taliban Out of British Hospital

The Pakistani schoolgirl hailed around the world for her efforts to stand up against the Taliban is out of the hospital.

Video released Friday by Britain's Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham shows 15-year-old Malala Yousafzai holding hands with one of the nurses and waving to hospital staff as she was discharged Thursday.

Malala was shot by Taliban gunmen in October as she returned home from school in Pakistan's northwestern Swat Valley. But the British hospital's medical director, Dave Rosser, says she has recovered sufficiently that she will benefit from being at home.

Home, for now, will be in central England.

Pakistan's ambassador to Britain, Wajid Shamsul Hassan, says officials are taking every precaution.

Malala's next surgery will be to repair damage done to her skull by the bullets.

**马里激进组织“暂停”停火**

马里的一个激进组织暂停了和政府的停火，理由是当局正在为开战做准备。

伊斯兰激进组织“伊斯兰后卫”发表声明说，他们愿意谈判但马里政府没有展示“丝毫和平谈判的诚意”。

该组织指责马里政府购买武器，招募兵员并动员民兵。

“伊斯兰后卫”发言人博马马向美国之音证实了声明的真实性。

“伊斯兰后卫”和图阿雷格族分离主义组织阿扎瓦德民族解放运动（MNLA）在12月21日同意与政府停火。

停火前的一天，联合国安理会批准了西非国家向马里派兵的方案。西非地区各国出兵的目的是收复马里北部，把“伊斯兰后卫”和另外两个伊斯兰激进组织赶走。

另外那两个组织“西非圣战统一运动”和“伊斯兰马格里布基地组织”拒绝参加在布基纳法索首都瓦加杜古举行的谈判。

Mali Islamist Group 'Suspends' Ceasefire

A Malian militant group has suspended a ceasefire with the government, saying officials are gearing up for war.

In a statement posted to its website, Islamist group Ansar Dine says it was willing to hold talks but says Mali's government has not shown "the least bit of sincere will for peace and negotiation."

The group accuses the government of buying arms, recruiting fighters, and mobilizing militias.

An Ansar Dine spokesman, Sanda Ould Boumama, confirmed the statement's authenticity to VOA.

Ansar Dine and the Tuareg separatist group MNLA agreed to a ceasefire with the government on December 21st.

The truce came a day after the U.N. Security Council approved a West African plan to deploy troops to Mali, with the goal of retaking the north from Ansar Dine and two other Islamist groups.

The two other groups -- the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa and al-Qaida in Islamic Maghreb -- have shunned negotiations taking place in Burkina Faso's capital, Ouagadougou.
