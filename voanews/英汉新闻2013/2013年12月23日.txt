**Japan Emperor Celebrates 80th Birthday**

Japanese Emperor Akihito has celebrated his 80th birthday, waving to a huge crowd from a balcony at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo.

Flanked by his family Monday, Emperor Akihito told the crowd of some 25,000 people that he prayed the coming year will be a good year for all.

To mark the birthday, video of the emperor speaking at a news conference last week was released Monday.

When asked about what had made a significant impact on his life, Akihito said World War Two stood out in his mind. He said it pains him deeply to think that so many people lost their lives at a young age.

The Japanese throne is held in deep respect by much of the public, despite being stripped of much of its status following World War Two.

**South Sudan: 'Matter of Time' Until Army Recaptures Control**


South Sudan's military says it is "a matter of time" before pro-government forces retake control of two state capitals from rebels.

Army spokesman Philip Aguer told VOA that soldiers backing former vice president Riek Machar control Bor in Jonglei state and Bentiu in oil-rich Unity state, but that the military is "capable of dealing with the rebellion."

He also accused fighters backing Machar of shooting at a U.S. aircraft that was evacuating citizens from Bor on Saturday. The U.S. military did not identify the shooters, but said four of its personnel were injured.
