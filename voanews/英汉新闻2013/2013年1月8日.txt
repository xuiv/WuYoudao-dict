**阿富汗“内部攻击”造成一人死亡**

英国军方官员说，一名英国军人在阿富汗被一名疑似阿富汗国民军成员打死。

英国国防部星期二说，袭击者在阿富汗南部赫尔曼德省的一个基地向国际联军开枪。当地官员说，还有几名英国军人在这次袭击中受伤。

北约驻阿富汗司令部说，星期一的这一事件是最近一起有关官员所称的“内部攻击”。

阿富汗的“内部攻击”有所增加，2012年有60多名外国军人死于这类攻击。

在星期一发生袭击之际，阿富汗总统卡尔扎伊和美国总统奥巴马正准备本星期晚些时候在华盛顿会晤，就两国间的长期安全协议问题进行磋商。

在美军和国际部队计划撤离阿富汗之际，阿富汗的安全问题越来越令人担忧。大部分北约军队将于2014年撤离阿富汗。一些美国军队将在2014年过后继续留驻，但尚未就此制定具体计划。

**One Dead in Afghan 'Insider' Attack **

British military officials say one of their soldiers has been killed in Afghanistan by a suspected member of the Afghan National Army.

Britain's Ministry of Defense said Tuesday the attacker turned his gun on international troops at a base in southern Helmand province and opened fire. Local officials say several other British troops were wounded in the attack.

The NATO command in Afghanistan says the killing Monday is the latest suspected incidence of what officials call "insider attacks."

"Insider" attacks have been on the on the rise in Afghanistan, leaving more than 60 foreign troops dead in 2012.

Monday's attack also came as Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai and U.S. President Barack Obama prepared to meet in Washington later in the week for talks on the long-term security agreement between the two nations.

Security in Afghanistan is of rising concern as U.S. and international forces draw down their troops. Most NATO troops are set to depart Afghanistan by 2014. Some U.S. forces are scheduled to remain after that, but details have yet to be worked out.

**日本就岛屿争端召见中国大使**

日本召见中国驻日大使，抗议中国政府的船只出现在有争议岛屿附近海域。仍在持续的领土争端继续损害这两个亚洲强国之间的关系。

日本外务省星期二于日本和中国的高层外交官会面时，向中国提出“强烈抗议”，并要求北京停止向日本管辖的岛屿附近海域派遣船只。

日本说，4艘中国海监船星期一进入资源丰富的有争议岛屿附近海域，并停留了13个小时。日本内阁官房长官菅义伟说，这一举动“极不寻常”和“令人遗憾”。

近几个月来，中国不断派遣船只驶往有争议水域，一些分析人士认为，北京试图造成一种既成事实，即中国船只可以自由来去。

**Japan Summons Chinese Ambassador about Island Dispute**

Japan has summoned the Chinese ambassador to protest the presence of government ships near contested islands, as a simmering territorial dispute continues to hamper relations between the two Asian powers.

Tokyo's foreign ministry lodged a "strong protest" against China on Tuesday, during a meeting between senior diplomatic officials, and demanded that Beijing stop sending vessels to the Japan-administered islands.

Japan says four Chinese maritime surveillance ships entered the area around the resource-rich archipelago on Monday and remained there for 13 hours. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga called the move "extremely unusual" and "regrettable."

In recent months, China has repeatedly sent ships to the disputed waters in what some analysts say is Beijing's attempt to establish the fact that it can come and go as it pleases.
