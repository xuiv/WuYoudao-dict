**中国处罚与铁道建筑公司丑闻有关的八人**

中国反贪当局惩处了与一家铁道建筑公司开支丑闻有关的八人。

星期一，中国有关官员没有详细说明对这八个人的处罚，但表示另有57人受到批评，还有一人被送交检察机关。

中国铁道建筑总公司今年早些时候承认，该公司去年花费1亿3千5百万美元用于待客，使民众感到愤怒。

调查人员还发现该公司的发票和账目存在问题。

今年7月，北京一家法院判处被控贪腐的前中国铁道部长刘志军死刑，缓刑两年。

在中国，死缓通常会减为无期徒刑。

China Punishes 8 People in Railway Scandal

China's anti-graft authorities have punished eight people in a scandal involving spending at a railway construction company.

Officials did not detail Monday what punishment the eight received, but said 57 other people have been criticized and one other sent for prosecution.

The China Railway Construction Corporation admitted earlier this year that it spent $135 million on receptions for guests last year, sparking public outrage.

Investigators also found problems with invoices and accounting.

A Beijing court gave former railways minister Liu Zhijun a two-year suspended death sentence in July for his role in corruption.

In China, a suspended death sentence is usually commuted to life in prison.

**哈尔滨出现重度雾霾 学校停课机场关闭**

中国东北城市哈尔滨空气污染极其严重，学校被迫停课，机场关闭，并造成交通堵塞。

气象预报部门官员星期一说，空气中对人体危害最大的微粒含量超过世界卫生组织设定的安全标准大约40倍。

中国官方的新华社说，星期一是哈尔滨启动冬季取暖的第一天，因此出现这一紧急状况。

经济高速发展以及大量使用煤在中国广大地区造成严重污染，迫使中国领导层不得不承诺加以改进。多年来，中国政府一直保证要努力解决污染问题，但成效甚微。

中国官员星期一说，预计重度雾霾将持续24小时。

Smog Shuts Down Chinese City


Choking clouds of pollution have virtually shut down the northeastern Chinese city of Harbin, forcing schools to suspend classes, snarling traffic and closing the airport.

Weather officials said Monday that concentrations of tiny airborne particles considered the most harmful to health were about 40 times higher than safe levels set by the World Health Organization.

The official Xinhua news agency blamed the emergency on the first day of the heating being turned on in the city for winter.

Pollution from rapid development and heavy coal use plagues wide areas of China, prompting pledges from the country's leadership to make improvement. The government has promised for years to tackle the pollution problem, but has made little progress.

Officials said Monday the heavy smog is expected to continue for 24 hours.
