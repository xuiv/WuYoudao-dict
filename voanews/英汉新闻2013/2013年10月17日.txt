**南京市长季建业涉嫌违纪接受调查**


南京市长季建业成为中国高调反腐的最新目标。

中共星期四发表声明说，季建业由于严重违纪行为而接受调查，这种说法通常是指贪污受贿。声明中没有透露任何细节。但中共官方喉舌人民日报说，这起案件可能涉及的金额相当于330万美元。

在中国国家主席习近平推动的反腐行动中，一些中高层官员落马。

针对政府官员的调查通常要持续几个月。几乎在所有案件中，涉案官员都被判定有罪。

习近平曾经警告说，如果不解决党内广泛存在的腐败问题，中共就可能丧失政权。


China Investigating Nanjing Mayor for Corruption



The mayor of the eastern Chinese city of Nanjing is the latest target in the Communist Party's high-profile crackdown on official corruption.

A party statement Thursday said Ji Jianye is under investigation for severe violations of discipline and law, which usually refers to graft.

The statement did not offer details. But the People's Daily, the party's official mouthpiece, said the case may have involved $3.3 million.

Several low-level officials and a handful of more senior leaders have been taken down in the anti-graft drive by President Xi Jinping.

Such investigations against government officials usually last several months. In almost every case, they end with the accused being found guilty.

President Xi has warned that failure to deal with widespread corruption within party ranks could mean the downfall of its grip on power.

Obama Signs Bill to End U.S. Government Shutdown

U.S. President Barack Obama has signed into law a last-minute compromise bill to reopen the federal government and raise the debt ceiling to avoid a potential U.S. debt default.

The president signed the bill early Thursday morning, after a flurry of activity on Capitol Hill Wednesday.

Members of the House of Representatives approved the plan late Wednesday by a vote of 285 to 144, after it was approved by the Senate earlier in the day (by a vote of 81 to 18).

White House budget office said federal workers should plan to return to work Thursday morning.

Mr. Obama has thanked leaders of both parties and said it is time to earn back the lost trust of the American people.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat, and his Republican colleague Mitch McConnell put together the composite bill Wednesday, a day before the current borrowing authority expired.

The bill will keep the government running until at least January 15 and raise the borrowing limit enough to put off the risk of default until at least February 7. In the meantime, lawmakers will negotiate on spending cuts.
