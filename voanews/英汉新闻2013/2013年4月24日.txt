**美国议员追究联邦各机构间的情报交流问题**

美国国会议员对联邦执法机构之间情报交流问题表示关注，同时调查人员继续了解上星期波士顿马拉松赛爆炸案的情况。

参议员格雷厄姆星期二说，联邦调查局去年不知道波士顿爆炸案嫌疑人之一塔梅尔兰•萨纳耶夫曾经去过车臣和达吉斯坦。

美国国土安全部部长纳波利塔诺对参议院情报委员会说，国土安全部知道塔梅尔兰•萨纳耶夫这次为期六个月的出行，但联邦调查局针对萨纳耶夫的警报在他返回美国时已经期满失效。

联邦调查局曾于2011年应俄罗斯的要求与萨纳耶夫进行面谈，但当时并未发现他与恐怖主义有任何联系。

在星期二举行的联邦调查局官员闭门情况介绍会上，共和党籍参议员科林斯说，美国政府各机构之间在交流“关键调查情报”过程中存在问题。
**US Lawmakers Probe Intelligence Sharing After Boston Bombing**

U.S. lawmakers have raised concerns about the sharing of intelligence among federal enforcement agencies, as investigators continue to piece together last week's deadly bombing of the Boston Marathon.

Senator Lindsey Graham said Tuesday that the FBI told him it did not know last year that one of the bombing suspects, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, traveled to Chechnya and Dagestan.

Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano told the Senate Intelligence Committee that her agency knew of the six-month trip, but that an FBI alert on Tsarnaev had expired by the time he returned.

The FBI had interviewed Tsarnaev in 2011 at the request of Russia, but found nothing to connect him to terrorism at that time.

After a closed-door briefing by FBI officials Tuesday, Republican Senator Susan Collins said there are problems with sharing of "critical investigative information" within and among different agencies.

** Gun Battle in China's Xinjiang Kills 21 People**

Chinese officials say at least 21 people were killed after a gun battle broke out during a police crackdown on suspected criminals in the restive northwestern province of Xinjiang.

State-run media say the clashes began Tuesday, when social workers came across what they called "suspicious individuals" and weapons in a house in western Kashgar prefecture.

When police later arrived to investigate, a gun fight broke out, resulting in the deaths of 15 social workers and police. The report also said six "gang members" were shot dead in the clashes, while another eight were captured.

It called the clashes a "violent terror incident" and said the group was plotting to use the weapons to "launch terror activities".

Xinjiang is an ethnically divided region that sees occasional outbreaks of violence, mainly between the predominantly Muslim Uighur community, government security forces, and the Han Chinese majority.
