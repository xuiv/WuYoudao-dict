**韩国总统命令军队应对朝鲜挑衅可不计政治后果**

韩国总统在与朝鲜的唇枪舌战中做出了迄今为止最强烈的表示。

有关方面说，朴槿惠总统星期一会见韩国国防部官员时，命令他们对来自朝鲜的任何挑衅做出及时有力的反应，而不必考虑政治后果。

美韩两国举行联合军事演习以及联合国安理会针对朝鲜进行第三次核试验而加强制裁，这使平壤感到愤怒，近几个星期来朝鲜不断对韩国和美国发出战争威胁，而且措辞越来越严厉。

目前还不清楚朴槿惠的命令将对美国军方产生什么影响，美国与韩国本月早些时候签署了一项协议，使美国军队得以在保护韩国免遭朝鲜挑衅时发挥更大作用。

** South Korean President Orders Military to Act Without Political Considerations Against North Korean Actions**

South Korea's president has made her strongest remarks yet in the escalating war of words with North Korea.

In a meeting Monday with defense ministry officials, President Park Geun-hye is quoted as ordering them to respond early and strongly to any provocation from North Korea, and without any regard to political consequences.

In recent weeks, North Korea has increased tensions with repeated threats of war against the South and the United States in anger over joint military exercises, as well as tightened U.N. Security Council resolutions for its third nuclear test.

It is not clear how Ms. Park's order will affect the U.S. military, which signed an agreement earlier this month giving American troops an expanded role in protecting the South from North Korean provocation.

**瑞士诺华制药公司在印度打输专利官司**

印度最高法院驳回瑞士诺华制药公司(Novartis)对治癌药Glivec的专利申请。

星期一，印度最高法院做出具有里程碑意义的裁决，拒绝给予升级版Glivec专利保护。

这项裁决将成为一项先例，防止国际制药公司就既有药品的升级版从印度获得新专利保护。

根据印度法律，公司不得为仅做细微变动的既有药品申请专利。

印度最高法院星期一裁定，升级版Glivec不具备印度专利法所要求的创新性质。

这项裁决是印度拥有巨额利润的非专利药制造业界的胜利，这一产业为世界各地数以百万计的人提供廉价药。

** Drug Maker Loses India Patent Battle**

India's Supreme Court has rejected a patent bid by Swiss drug maker Novartis for a cancer drug.

In a landmark ruling Monday, the court dismissed patent protection to an updated version of the drug Glivec.

The ruling is a precedent that prevents international pharmaceutical companies from obtaining fresh patents in India on updated versions of existing drugs.

India's law prevents companies from seeking patents for making only slight modifications to an existing drug.

The Supreme Court decided Monday the updated Glivec did not satisfy the "novelty" aspect required by Indian patent law.

The ruling is a victory for India's multi-billion-dollar generic drug industry that provides cheap medicines to millions around the world.

Novartis has been fighting since 2006 to win a patent for the amended form of Glivec.
