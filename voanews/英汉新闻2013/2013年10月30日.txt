**天安门撞车事件后当局搜寻八名嫌疑人**

中国警方正在搜寻本星期北京天安门广场撞车事件的八名嫌疑人。这一事件造成五人死亡。

北京几家旅店的工作人员星期三说，警方要求他们留意看来是来自新疆的八名男子。

旅店人员说，其中七名男子的姓名是维族常用名。长期以来，维族人一直对当局的宗教压制做法表示不满。旅店人员还说，还有一人是汉族姓名。

在中国媒体上，几乎没有关于这一事件细节的报道。但外国媒体报道说，中国官员相信是来自新疆的人进行自杀式袭击。

事件发生的两天后，北京仍然戒备森严。尽管天安门广场已经重新开放，看来警方加紧检查北京及周边地区车辆的牌照。

8 Suspects Sought Following Tiananmen Crash

Chinese police are looking for eight suspects in connection with a car crash that killed five people this week in Beijing's symbolic Tiananmen Square.

Staff at several Beijing hotels said Wednesday police have warned them to be on the lookout for eight men who appear to be from the troubled northwest region of Xinjiang.

Hotel staff say seven of the men have names commonly given to Uighurs, a mostly Muslim minority that has long complained of religious persecution. They say the other name was that of a majority Han Chinese suspect.

Details of the crash in Chinese media have been scarce. But foreign media have reported officials believe it was a suicide attack by people from Xinjiang.

Two days later, security remained tight in the capital. Though Tiananmen Square has been reopened, police appear to have increased their checks on license plates of cars in and around Beijing in response to the crash.


**美国国安局长：美国没有监视欧洲国家公民**

美国国家安全局局长亚历山大表示，有关国安局搜集千百万欧洲公民电话记录的报道完全不实。美国国安局是一个高度机密机构。

亚历山大星期二在一个国会委员会举行的听证会上说，欧洲情报机构与美国国安局分享了那些电话记录。亚历山大表示，这些电话记录的细节被用于保护美国和欧洲的前线部队以及国内人民。

亚历山大表示，欧洲的报纸错误解读了被美国国安局前合同工斯诺登盗窃的文件。

有关美国国安局搜集美国的电话记录并监听35位世界各国领导人通讯的报道，激起千百万持各种政治立场的美国人的愤怒。

但亚历山大表示，美国国安局在世界范围内进行的大规模电话和互联网数据搜集防止了近年来美国的13起恐怖分子袭击阴谋以及欧洲的25起袭击阴谋。
NSA Chief: US Does Not Spy on European Citizens

The head of the super-secret U.S. National Security Agency says reports that it collected telephone records of millions of European citizens are completely false.

Keith Alexander told a congressional panel Tuesday that European spy agencies shared those records with the NSA. Alexander said the details were used to defend U.S. and European forces in the field and citizens at home.

The NSA chief said European newspapers misinterpreted documents stolen from the NSA by former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden.

Reports that the NSA collected U.S. phone records and monitored communications from 35 world leaders have outraged millions of Americans of all political persuasions.

But Alexander said the NSA's massive worldwide collection of telephone and Internet data stopped 13 terrorist plots in the United States and 25 plots in Europe in recent years.
