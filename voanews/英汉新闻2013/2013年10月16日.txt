**美国债务最后期限临近而有关协议推迟**

星期二，美国国会议员们仍未就结束政府关闭以及提高举债上限以避免发生债务违约的提案达成协议。

众议院共和党领导人搁置了对一项修正案的表决，此前这项议案看来不能在众议院获得足够的支持，而且不可能在参议院获得通过。

参议院的民主党及共和党领导人等待众议院的谈判结果，然后再继续就早些时候的一项议案进行谈判。

参众两院的提案将为重开政府拨款，并在短期内提高举债上限。但众议院的提案内容包括修改奥巴马总统的医保法案。民主党人反对将医保法案或其他任何问题与开支议案绑在一起。

奥巴马总统在纽约接受WABC电视台采访时，敦促议员们抛开政治，停止伤害美国人民。

星期四是提高债务上限的最后期限。只有提高债务上限，美国政府才能继续举债以避免债务违约。由于国会议员们未能就有关议案达成一致立场，美国更加逼近最后期限。

Deal Delayed As US Debt Deadline Looms

Another day has passed in Washington with no deal to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling to avoid a possible default.

House Republican leaders put off a possible vote on a revised plan, after it became apparent it did not have enough support in the House and would not pass the Senate.

Democratic and Republican Senate leaders, who were waiting to see what the outcome would be in the House, then resumed negotiations on their earlier plan.

Both House and Senate proposals would fund the government and raise the debt ceiling for the short term. But the House plan would make changes in President Barack Obama's health care law. Democrats oppose attaching health care or other issues to any spending bill.

In an interview with WABC television in New York, President Obama appealed to lawmakers to put politics aside and stop inflicting pain on the American people.

Congress' failure to agree on a single bill moved the country closer to a Thursday deadline to raise the debt ceiling so the government can continue to borrow money to pay its bills.

Khmer Rouge Tribunal Begins Closing Statements

Survivors of Cambodia's Khmer Rouge packed a courtroom in Phnom Penh on Wednesday to hear the start of closing statements in the trial of two of the group's senior ex-leaders.

Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan face charges of genocide and crimes against humanity for their part in the 1970s rule of the communist Khmer Rouge, which is blamed for the deaths of nearly two million Cambodians.

Both men, now in their 80s, attended Wednesday's session of the U.N.-backed tribunal. Closing statements are expected to run through the rest of October. A verdict is expected in the first half of next year.
