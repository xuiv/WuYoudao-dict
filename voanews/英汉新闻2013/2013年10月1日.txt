**美国联邦政府开始实施部分关闭**

由于美国国会参众两院未能在10月1日之前就一项拨款议案达成一致立场，美国联邦政府已经开始实施17年来的首次部分关闭。

星期一，美国国会众议院前后三次通过包含推迟实施奥巴马总统标志性的医保法案条款的拨款议案，但每次都随即被民主党人控制的参议院否决。

接近星期一午夜时，白宫预算事务主管伯韦尔发布指示，要求联邦各机构“实施有序关闭的方案”。这意味着大约80万名联邦雇员将被强制不带薪休假。受到影响的机构包括国家公园、交通运输安全部门以及国防部。在国防部，被强制休假的主要是文职人员。国土安全部、边防部门以及其他执法机构将继续办公。

美国总统奥巴马星期二凌晨发表声明说，美国军人将继续履行职责，正在执行过程中的军事行动，如在阿富汗的军事行动，将继续进行。奥巴马表示，他计划签署一项法案，以确保按时给军人发饷。此外，奥巴马还保证努力争取国会让政府机构恢复正常运作。


U.S. Government Begins Shutdown

The U.S. government has enacted a partial shutdown for the first time in 17 years, as the two branches of Congress failed by the October 1st deadline to agree on a single spending bill.

Three times on Monday, the Republican-led House of Representatives approved a spending bill that would delay President Barack Obama's signature health care law. In all three cases, the Democratic-controlled Senate rejected it minutes later.

Shortly before midnight, White House Budget Director Sylvia Burwell issued a directive to federal agencies to "execute plans for an orderly shutdown." The move means the furlough of an estimated 800,000 federal workers. Agencies affected will include national parks, traffic safety agencies, and the Defense Department -- mainly the furlough of its civilian employees. Homeland Security agents and border security offices will remain open, as well as other law enforcement agencies.

In a statement early Tuesday, U.S. President Barack Obama said members of the U.S. military will remain on duty and ongoing military operations like those in Afghanistan will continue. He said he plans to sign into law a bill that will ensure members of the military are paid on time. Mr. Obama also pledged to work to get Congress to reopen the government.


**内塔尼亚胡将在联大强调对伊朗核项目的担忧**

预计以色列总理内塔尼亚胡星期二在联合国大会上发言时，将强调他对伊朗核项目的担忧。

内塔尼亚胡星期一会晤美国总统奥巴马时说，如果伊朗在与西方国家谈判的同时继续实施其核项目，就应对伊朗实行更严厉的制裁。

内塔尼亚胡还强调，伊朗必须放弃其核项目中的任何军事成分。伊朗否认其核项目是用于军事目的。
奥巴马说，在减轻对伊朗的制裁之前，伊朗必须用行动证明自己的诚意。那些制裁是在伊朗藐视要求它停止浓缩铀的命令之后施加的。奥巴马表示，世界各强国将以清醒的态度与伊朗谈判，并将与以色列密切磋商。

Netanyahu to Stress Iran Nuclear Concerns in UN Speech

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to press his concerns about Iran's nuclear program in his Tuesday address to the United Nations General Assembly.

Mr. Netanyahu said Monday, in a meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama, that Iran should face tougher sanctions if it continues to advance its nuclear work while negotiating with the West.

The Israeli leader also stressed that Iran must give up any military aspect of its nuclear program -- which Iran has denied it is pursuing.

Mr. Obama said Iran must prove its sincerity through actions before getting any relief from the sanctions imposed after it defied orders to stop enriching uranium. He said world powers will negotiate with Iran in a "clear-eyed" manner and will consult Israel closely.
