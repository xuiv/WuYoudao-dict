**中国经济增长放缓**

世界第二大经济体中国的经济增速减缓到1991年以来的最低水平，其中的部分原因是进出口贸易疲弱。

中国国家统计局星期一发布的报告显示，今年第二季度经济同比增长百分之7.5，比第一季度百分之7.7的增速有所下降。

国际咨询公司IHS环球透视经济学家任先芳说，中国经济增速连续5个季度低于百分之8，这是“不景气的明显迹象”。

中国国家统计局说，经济增速减慢源于其它国家经济环境乏力，也是新一届政府实施改革的结果。报告说，改革将使国家经济长期受益。

目前没有迹象显示北京将采取任何重大刺激措施，或通过改变经济政策来应对经济增长减缓。

中国经济放缓，加上中国国内对各种商品需求的减少，可能产生全球性的影响。

**China's Economic Growth Slows**

China's economic growth has slowed to its lowest level since 1991, with the world's second largest economy hurt in part by weak trade.

The National Bureau of Statistics released a report Monday showing that the economy expanded 7.5 percent over a year earlier in the three months ending in June, down from the previous quarter's 7.7 percent.

Economist Ren Xianfang of IHS Global Insight said China's growth of under 8 percent for five straight quarters is "a clear sign of distress."

The statistics bureau said the slowdown was a result of weak economic conditions abroad and a result of reforms taken by the new government that the report says will benefit its economy in the long run.

There is no indication so far that Beijing will respond with any major stimulus or shift in economic policy.

The economic slowdown, along with a decrease in Chinese demand for various goods, could have global repercussions.

与此同时，穆尔西所属的穆斯林兄弟会敦促其支持者星期一在开罗举行和平集会。穆斯林兄弟会已经举行了一系列大规模抗议活动，反对军方罢免穆尔西。

几天来，成千上万人在开罗东北部的一座清真寺附近举行集会，要求恢复穆尔西的总统职位。

**US Stresses 'Inclusive' Egypt**

U.S. officials are in Cairo to meet with Egypt's interim leaders and stress the need for a transition to "an inclusive, democratically elected civilian government."

Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns is making the first visit by a high-ranking U.S. official since the military ousted Islamist president Mohamed Morsi earlier this month. The State Department says his talks Monday and Tuesday also include civil society and business leaders.

Those meetings come as Mr. Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood urges its supporters to gather peacefully Monday in Cairo for the latest in a series of mass protests against his removal.

Thousands have been rallying for days near a mosque in northeast Cairo to demand the former president's reinstatement.
