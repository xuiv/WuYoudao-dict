**朝鲜举行炮兵实弹射击训练**

朝鲜官方媒体表示，朝鲜最高领导人金正恩现场观看并指导炮兵部队在与韩国敏感的临近海域举行的实弹射击训练。与此同时，平壤不断加剧朝鲜半岛的紧局势。

朝中社报道说，金正恩观看了炮兵部队在黄海的两个岛屿上对“假想敌方阵地”进行的实弹射击。但是星期四的报道并没有说明这次炮击训练的具体时间。

朝鲜警告说要对美国发动核打击。上星期联合国因朝鲜最近的核试验而对其实施制裁后，朝鲜也多次对韩国发出威胁。

目前人们并不认为朝鲜拥有能打到美国的核武器，但是人们担心，朝鲜会攻击有争议的边界地区。这些地区近年来发生过数次冲突，并造成人员伤亡。

N.Korea Holds Live Artillery Drills, as Tensions Mount


North Korean state media says leader Kim Jong Un has overseen a live artillery drill near a sensitive sea border area, as Pyongyang continues to stir up tension on the Korean peninsula.

The Korean Central News Agency says Mr. Kim watched as the artillery units pounded what it called the "imaginary targets of the enemy" on two islands in the Yellow Sea. The Thursday report did not specify when the drill took place.

North Korea has threatened a nuclear war against the United States and made a series of threats against the South after the United Nations last week imposed sanctions for its latest nuclear test.

It is not believed to have the capacity to attack the U.S. with a nuclear weapon. But there is fear it may attack areas near the disputed border, which has been the site of several deadly clashes in recent years.


**中国对天主教新教宗表示祝贺并提出批评**

罗马天主教推选出新教宗之后，中国星期四向梵蒂冈表示祝贺，同时也提出批评。

中国政府与梵蒂冈没有外交关系。估计中国大约有8百万到1千2百万天主教徒，梵蒂冈和中国常常因为中国政府对于这些天主教徒的权力问题产生摩擦。

中国外交部发言人华春莹表示，中国与梵蒂冈关系的改善完全取决于梵蒂冈是否和台湾断绝关系，以及梵蒂冈必须停止她所说的对中国事务的干涉。

华春莹还对新当选的教宗弗朗西斯表示祝贺。她说，北京期望新教宗能够对中国采取“现实和灵活”的态度。

北京不允许梵蒂冈任命在中国的主教，天主教会对此不满。中国领导人认为梵蒂冈的政策干涉中国的内政。

China Congratulates, Criticizes Vatican on New Pope

China sent a message of both congratulations and criticism to the Vatican on Thursday following the election of a new Roman Catholic pope.

The Chinese government does not have diplomatic relations with Vatican. The two sides have regularly clashed over authority of China's estimated eight to 12 million Catholics.

Foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said any improvement in relations depends on whether the Vatican cuts ties with Taiwan and stops what she called "interference" in China's affairs.

She also congratulated Pope Francis on his election, saying Beijing hopes he is able to take a "practical and flexible" attitude toward China.

Beijing does not allow the Vatican to appoint its own bishops, an issue that has angered the church. Chinese leaders regard Vatican policy as interference in the country's internal affairs.
