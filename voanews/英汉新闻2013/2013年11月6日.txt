**山西省委所在地附近发生爆炸 一死八伤**

中国国家媒体说，位于山西省太原市的山西省委所在地附近星期三早上发生一系列小型爆炸，造成一人死亡，八人受伤。

中国官方的新华社说，在爆炸现场发现了散落地上的滚珠和钉子，据信是自制炸弹爆炸。滚珠和钉子常用于自制炸弹，目的是尽量增大对过往人群的杀伤力。

一名目击者对新华社说，他当时在现场附近等交通灯，看到一辆小面包车爆炸。有些人报告说，听到七次爆炸声。社交网站上的画面显示，几辆汽车受到轻微损坏，如车窗玻璃被炸碎。

警方封锁了现场。目前没有关于肇事动机的消息。

一个多星期前，天安门广场发生致命撞车爆炸事件，北京当局认为是穆斯林分离主义分子所为。

**Blasts Outside Communist Party Office in Shanxi Kills 1 Wound 8**

Chinese state media say a series of small explosions went off early Wednesday outside the Shanxi Provincial Committee office in Taiyuan, killing one person and injured eight others.

The official Xinhua news agency says ball bearings and nails were found scattered at the scene, leading Xinhua to report the blasts were caused by "self-made bombs." Such materials are often used to help maximize damage to passersby.

One witness told Xinhua he was waiting on a traffic light in front the building when saw a minivan explode. Others reported hearing as many as seven blasts. Pictures on social media showed multiple vehicles with minor damage, such as windows blown out.

Police have sealed off the area. There is no word on motive.

The incident comes just over a week after a deadly car crash and explosion in Tiananmen Square that Beijing has blamed on Muslim separatists.



**内塔尼亚胡希望克里能推动实现以巴和平**

以色列总理内塔尼亚胡表示，他愿与巴勒斯坦实现和平，并希望到访的美国国务卿克里能够推动谈判，以达成一项“历史性”协议。

星期三，内塔尼亚胡与克里在耶路撒冷开始举行会谈。内塔尼亚胡对三个月来的和谈表现出保留态度。

克里星期三还将会见巴勒斯坦民族权力机构主席阿巴斯。他说，谈判中总会存在“困难”与“紧张状态”，但他确信有关各方可以克服这些障碍。克里表示，以巴双方要想达到目标，就需要做出妥协和困难的决定。

克里还谈及内塔尼亚胡的担忧，即世界各强国可能通过谈判与伊朗达成一项协议，在伊朗不全部放弃其铀浓缩能力的情况下减轻对伊朗的制裁。

美国及其西方盟国怀疑伊朗正在研制核武器。伊朗对此予以否认，声称其核项目是为了和平目的。

** Netanyahu Hopes Kerry Can Steer Talks Toward Peace**

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he wants peace with the Palestinians, and hopes visiting U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry can return negotiations to a place where a "historical" agreement can be achieved.

Mr. Netanyahu and Kerry opened a meeting Wednesday in Jerusalem. The Israeli leader voiced reservations about the three-month-old peace talks.

Kerry, who is also meeting Wednesday with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, said there are always "difficulties" and "tensions" within negotiations, but that he is confident the parties can work through them. He said both the Israelis and Palestinians need to make compromises and hard decisions to achieve their goal.

He also addressed Mr. Netanyahu's concern that world powers may negotiate an agreement with Iran that would decrease sanctions in return for anything less than the full dismantling of its nuclear enrichment capability.

The United States and its Western allies suspect Iran is developing nuclear weapons. Iran has denied the charge, saying its nuclear program is designed for peaceful purposes.
