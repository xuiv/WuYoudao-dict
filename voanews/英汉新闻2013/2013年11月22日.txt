**伊朗与世界大国的核谈判进入关键的第三天**

星期五，伊朗和世界六强国在日内瓦进入至关重要的第三天核谈判，争取就一项临时协议消除双方之间的分歧，该协议将规定德黑兰对其核项目加以限制，以换取国际社会放松制裁。

星期四举行会谈后，双方的外交官们都表示取得了进展，但同时指出仍然存在实质性分歧。看来一个关键问题是允许伊朗从事铀浓缩活动的限度，另一个关键问题是放松制裁的程度。

目前双方讨论的是第一阶段的协议，这项协议的目的是使双方在拟定一项更广泛协议的过程中建立相互信任，以缓和西方国家对伊朗制造核武器能力的担忧。

伊朗副外长阿拉克奇星期四说，伊朗不会同意中止铀浓缩活动。

德黑兰否认伊朗意图制造核武器。伊朗提出，如果西方国家放松制裁，伊朗愿意部分中止其部分核项目，并同意对其设施加强检查。

Iran, World Powers Enter Crucial Third Day of Nuclear Talks

Iran and six world powers enter a crucial third day of talks Friday in Geneva, where they will try to close gaps on an interim deal that would curb Tehran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.

Diplomats from both sides reported progress following Thursday's meeting, but said substantial disagreements remain. A key sticking point appears to be to what extent Iran will be allowed to enrich uranium. Another is how much the sanctions will be relaxed.

Under discussion is a first-phase agreement meant to build trust while the two sides work out a more comprehensive deal that would ease Western concerns about Iran's ability to build nuclear weapons.

Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said Thursday his country will not agree to suspend uranium enrichment.

Tehran denies it wants to build a nuclear weapon. It has offered to suspend parts of its nuclear program and agreed to tighter inspections if the West relaxes sanctions that have devastated its economy.
