**中国民众纪念六四事件24周年**

在中国民众纪念六四镇压24周年之际，北京戒备森严，并对互联网进行严厉的新闻检查。

中国当局每年都竭力防止民众举行纪念六四的活动，并禁止民众讨论发生在1989年6月4日的残酷军事镇压。持续数星期的民众示威活动在镇压中结束。

星期五警察部署在天安门广场和其他重要地区，防止可能出现的抗议活动。在敏感的六四周年到来之前，很多活动人士已被拘留、软禁或受到严密监视。

当局的新闻检查人员尽力删除中国社交网站上所有提及六四的信息。在用户众多的新浪微博上，所有与六四有关的信息都被屏蔽。

很多中国民众试图避开当局的限制，他们将蜡烛图像上传到网上，或者讽刺地称5月35号，而不是6月4号。还有人呼吁大家穿黑色衣服，以示对六四死难者的悼念。

**China Marks 24th Anniversary of Tiananmen Crackdown**

China is marking the 24th anniversary Tiananmen Square crackdown, amid tight security in Beijing and stifling censorship on the web.

Authorities every year work hard to prevent memorials and ban public discussion of the brutal military suppression on June 4, 1989, which ended weeks of pro-democracy demonstrations.

On Friday, police in Tiananmen Square and other prominent areas stood on guard for possible protests. Many activists have already been detained, placed under house arrest, or monitored closely in the lead-up to the sensitive anniversary.

Government censors are also working hard to scrub China's social media of any mention of the incident. On the popular, Twitter-like Sina Weibo, searches for all Tiananmen-related terms were blocked.

Attempting to get around the restrictions, many Chinese citizens instead posted pictures of candles, or cynically referred to May 35, rather than June 4 - a search term that is also blocked. Others encouraged people to wear black as a symbol of mourning for the victims of the incident.

**南非“刀锋战士”首次出庭**

南非田径明星皮斯托瑞斯自2月杀害女友后获准保释以来，首次出庭。

星期二，在比勒陀利亚举行了短暂的审前听证，法官同意将庭审推迟到8月19日。律师要求更多时间来准备应诉。

皮斯托瑞斯2月14日在比勒陀利亚的家中开枪打死他的女友斯廷坎普，他被控犯有谋杀罪。

皮斯托瑞斯因装有碳纤维义肢而被称为“刀锋战士”。他承认曾向斯汀坎普开枪，但坚称当时他将女友误认做闯入家中的窃贼。

在去年举行的伦敦奥运会上，皮斯托瑞斯成为第一位参加正常人比赛的双腿截肢的短跑选手，从而成为许多人心目中的励志英雄。

** "Blade Runner" Appears in Court for the First Time**

South African track star Oscar Pistorius has made his first court appearence since being granted bail in February over the killing of his girlfriend.

The pre-trial hearing in Pretoria Tuesday was brief, with the magistrate agreeing to postpone the proceedings until August 19. Lawyers had asked for more time to prepare for the case.

Pistorious is facing murder charges for shooting and killing his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, at his home in Pretoria on February 14.
Pistorius, known as the "blade runner" for his carbon-fiber legs, has admiting shooting Steenkamp but insists he mistook her for an intruder.

Pistorius became an inspirational hero to millions as the first double amputee to compete against able-bodied competitors at the London Olympics last year.
