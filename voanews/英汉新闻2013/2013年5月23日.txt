**British PM called the killing a terrorist incident **

British Prime Minister David Cameron was meeting Thursday with his top security advisers, one day after a man was butchered to death in broad daylight on a south London street near an army barracks.

Mr. Cameron called the killing "appalling," saying there are strong
indications it was a terrorist incident. He chaired an emergency national security meeting after cutting short a visit to France.

Scotland Yard's counterterrorism unit is leading the investigation, but few details have been officially released.

Police shot and wounded the two suspects and they are under guard in a hospital. The victim is believed to be a British soldier, but has not yet been publicly identified.
