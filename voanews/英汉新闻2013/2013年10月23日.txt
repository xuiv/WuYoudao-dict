**中国报纸要求警方释放记者**

一家中国报纸呼吁当局释放该报一名记者，这名记者在揭露一家国有企业的财务问题后遭到逮捕。

星期三，新快报在头版刊登了一篇语气激烈的社论，标题是“请放人”。

记者陈永洲星期五被逮捕，他涉嫌损害一家企业的声誉，此前他撰写了有关建筑设备公司中联重科财务问题的系列报道。

陈永洲在报道中说，中联重科虚报利润。中联重科是香港和深圳上市公司，去年上报收入760亿美元。湖南省政府拥有该公司大约六分之一的股份。

广州的新快报说，没有陈永洲犯罪的任何证据。该报措辞强烈的社论说，记者不应因撰写让有权势的官员或企业感到难堪的报道而受惩罚。

Chinese Newspaper Calls for Police to Release Reporter

A Chinese newspaper is calling for the release one of its journalists who was arrested after exposing alleged financial wrongdoing at a state-owned company.

The New Express tabloid on Wednesday published an impassioned, front-page editorial under the bold headline, "Please Release Our Man."

The journalist, Chen Yongzhou, was arrested Friday on suspicion of "damaging the reputation of a business" after he wrote a series of reports on the finances of the Zoomlion construction equipment company.

Chen's reports claimed Zoomlion artificially inflated its profits. The company, which is listed in the Hong Kong and Shenzhen stock exchanges, reported revenues of $7.6 billion last year. The Hunan provincial government owns about one-sixth of the company.

The New Express, which is located in the southern city of Guangzhou, says there is no evidence that Chen committed a crime. The strongly worded editorial said journalists should not be punished for writing stories that embarrass powerful officials or companies.

**中印达成防务合作协议**

中国和印度已经同意在有争议的喜马拉雅山脉边界地带加强防务合作。长期以来，中印两国一直是地区竞争对手。
印度总理辛格与中国总理李克强举行会谈后，双方星期三在北京签署了有关协议。
辛格说，这项防务合作协议将有助于确保印中两国关系不会因数十年来的边界争端而进一步紧张化。
今年4月，中印边界争端激化。印度指责中国军队在印度宣称拥有主权的地区纵深至少10公里处设立营地。北京否认中国军队进入印度领土。

China, India Reach Defense Cooperation Deal

Longtime regional competitors China and India have agreed to strengthen defense cooperation along their disputed, and sometimes tense, Himalayan border.

The confidence building agreement was signed Wednesday in Beijing following a meeting by Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.

Prime Minister Singh said the defense cooperation pact will help ensure the India-China relationship is not further strained by the decades-old border dispute, which flared up in April.

In April, India accused Chinese troops of setting up a camp that was at least 10 kilometers inside territory claimed by India. China denied that troops had crossed into Indian territory.
