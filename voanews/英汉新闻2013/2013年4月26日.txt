韩国处理与朝鲜关系的高级官员统一部长官柳吉在说，到了从关闭的开城工业园区撤回韩国人员的时候了。

柳吉在星期五说，韩国政府已经做出撤回大约180名韩国人员的“不可避免的决定”。

在做出这个决定的几个小时之前，朝鲜拒绝了韩国提出的举行正式谈判以恢复开城工业园区运转的建议。

首尔当局星期四向平壤提出举行谈判的24小时期限，首尔警告说如果平壤不同意举行谈判，韩国将采取严厉反应措施。

星期五在期限过了几个小时之后，平壤拒绝了首尔的建议，并且警告说，如果首尔坚持在开城这个边界城镇恶化双方关系，朝鲜将首先采取严厉行动。

韩国总统朴槿惠星期五召集了内阁中的安全事务有关部长开会，研究如何处理开城工业园区的问题。

**South Korea to Pull Workers from Kaesong Industrial Complex**

The top South Korean official charged with handling North-South relations says the time has come for South Korean workers still at the shuttered Kaesong factory zone to return home.

Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae said Friday that the government has made an "unavoidable decision" to bring about 180 South Korean workers home.

The decision came hours after North Korea rejected the South's proposal for formal negotiations to restart operations at the Kaesong complex.

Seoul gave Pyongyang 24 hours on Thursday to agree to talks, warning of a tough response if Pyongyang did not agree to the offer.

Hours after the deadline passed Friday, Pyongyang dismissed the offer and warned that it would be the first to take tough action if the South insists on worsening the situation at the border town.

South Korean President Park Geun-hye met with her security-related Cabinet ministers on Friday, regarding fate of the Kaesong complex.

**英美担心叙利亚可能使用了化学武器**

英国首相卡梅伦说，有越来越多的证据显示，叙利亚政府对反政府力量使用了化学武器，证实了美国情报机构一份报告的说法。

卡梅伦星期五说，这一事态非常令人不安。他还说，这种做法是战争罪行，应该是国际社会的“底线”。

美国白宫星期四说，美国各情报机构程度不同地相信，叙利亚政府对试图推翻阿萨德总统的反政府力量小规模使用了沙林毒气。

不过，白宫还说，目前的证据还不足以改变美国在这个问题上的决策。

一些美国议员加大呼吁力度，要求美国军事干预叙利亚冲突。自从2011年3月叙利亚冲突开始以来，已经有至少7万人丧生。

另一方面，星期五，在首都大马士革爆发激烈战斗。叙利亚人权了望台说，在大马士革北部的巴尔泽社区，反政府力量和政府军之间在星期五发生激烈冲突。

这个总部设在英国的人权团体还说，反政府力量和政府军在首都以东的焦巴尔地区和大马士革南部的一些地区也进行战斗。叙利亚人权了望台从一个活动人士网络和前线战斗人员那里获得了消息。这个组织说，在星期四的战斗中至少有130人死亡。

**Britain,US Concerned by Possible Chemical Weapons Use in Syria**

British Prime Minister David Cameron says there is growing evidence the Syrian government has used chemical weapons against rebels, backing up a report by U.S. intelligence agencies.

Prime Minister Cameron on Friday called the development "very disturbing," adding that it would amount to a war crime and should represent a "red line" for the international community.

On Thursday, the White House said U.S. spy agencies believe with "varying degrees of confidence" the Syrian government has used sarin gas on a small scale against rebels trying to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad.

But the disclosure said the evidence was not conclusive enough to change U.S. decision-making on the issue.

Some U.S. lawmakers have been more vocal in calling for the U.S. to intervene militarily in the conflict, which has killed at least 70,000 people since it began in March 2011.

Meanwhile, fighting raged on in the capital, Damascus, on Friday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says "fierce clashes" between rebels and government troops broke out in the Barzeh neighborhood in north Damascus.

The Britain-based group also said rebels and troops fought in Jobar district east of the capital, as well as parts of southern Damascus. The group, which gets its information from a network of activists and fighters on the ground, said at least 130 people died from the fighting on Thursday.
