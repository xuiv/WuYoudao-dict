这位男子名叫塞姆桑加•扬蒂洁（Thamsanqa Jantjie）。他星期四对约翰内斯堡《明星报》说， 在星期二的追悼仪式上，他听到异常声音，产生幻觉，这影响了他对美国总统奥巴马等领导人讲话的手语翻译。

他说：“我对我一直在做的绝对满意，就像我说的那样，我一向是头号的手语专家。你知道，我为很多重大活动做过翻译，不仅仅是现在出问题的这次。”

Mandela Memorial Interpreter Blames Schizophrenia for Sign Language Failure

The sign language interpreter criticized by organizations for the deaf as giving "meaningless" signs during the memorial service for Nelson Mandela has blamed a schizophrenic episode for his performance.

Thamsanqa Jantjie told a Johannesburg newspaper, The Star, that he heard voices and hallucinated during Tuesday's service, which affected his ability to interpret the speeches by leaders such as U.S. President Barack Obama.

He said he was sorry, and that there was nothing he could do. He also told South Africa's Radio 702 on Thursday that he was happy with his work.

"Absolutely, what I've been doing, I think that I've been a champion of sign language as I've been saying that. You know, I've interpreted many big events, not only the event in question now."

South Africa's Deputy Minister of Women, Children and People with Disabilities, Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu said that the interpreter became overwhelmed and did not use normal signs.

She said Thursday there was a "clear indication" that the company that hired him has for years provided substandard services.

She also apologized to the deaf community, and said the issue highlights the challenges that deaf people around the world face every day in trying to communicate.

**阿什顿：乌克兰“打算签署”欧盟协议**

欧洲联盟外交政策主管阿什顿说，乌克兰总统亚努科维奇“打算签署”跟欧盟的贸易与合作协议。上个月，亚努科维奇拒绝签约，引发大规模反政府抗议。

阿什顿在乌克兰首都基辅与亚努科维奇会谈之后，星期四在布鲁萨尔对新闻媒体说，乌克兰所面临的短期经济与金融问题，显然可以通过签署欧盟联系国协议来加以缓解，因为协议将引来欧盟国家的新投资。

她说：“亚努科维奇明确向我表示，他打算签署联系国协议。他谈到了乌克兰面临的短期经济问题。在我看来，这些挑战虽然都是切实存在的，但可以得到帮助来解决这些问题，这种帮助不仅仅来自欧盟机构。通过签署联系国协议，他将显示他有认真的经济方案，这也将帮助吸引他所需要的投资。”

与此同时，反政府抗议仍在持续。示威者要求和欧盟加强联系。

星期三，防暴警察大批集结，逼近基辅独立广场上成千上万的抗议者，随后美国谴责了警方的行动，并表示正在考虑对此作出回应，包括可能采取制裁行动。

总统亚努科维奇呼吁展开对话，以结束抗议，但基辅的反对派领袖拒绝了他的要求。亚努科维奇最近拒绝与欧盟签约，转而决定加强与俄罗斯的关系，此举引发了抗议浪潮。


Ashton: Ukraine “Intends to Sign” Agreement with EU

European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton says Ukraine's President Viktor Yanukovic "intends to sign" a trade and cooperation agreement with the EU that he rejected last month, setting off massive anti-government protests.

Ashton spoke to reporters in Brussels Thursday, after holding talks with Mr. Yanukovich in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. She said it is clear that the short-term economic and financial issues Ukraine faces can be alleviated by signing the association agreement, bringing in fresh investment from EU nations.

"Look, Yanukovych made it clear to me that he intends to sign the association agreement. What he talked about were the short-term economic issues that the country faces. And it is my view that those challenges, which are real, can be addressed by the support that not only comes from the European Union institutions, but actually by showing that he has a serious economic plan in signing the association agreement also will help to bring in the kind of investment that he needs."

Meanwhile, anti-government protests continue, with demonstrators calling for closer ties with the European Union.

After riot police converged on thousands of protesters in Kyiv's Independence Square Wednesday, the United States denounced the police actions and said it is considering its response, including possible sanctions.

Opposition leaders in Kyiv have rejected a call by President Yanukovych for talks aimed at ending the protests against his recent move to step back from the EU trade deal, in favor of boosting ties with Russia.
