**三名中国反腐人士受审**

三名中国反腐活动人士星期一出庭受审，这一案件凸显了中国政府不能容忍民众公开发表不同观点。

对刘萍、魏忠平和李思华的审判在南部的江西省进行，当局戒备森严。今年4月，这三名活动人士在江西省举行了一次抗议活动。他们被控非法集会、在公共场合聚众滋事，以及利用邪教损害法律。

这三名活动人士属于中国低层民众的新公民运动，要求中国官员公示个人资产。近几个月来，已有至少十几名参与新公民运动的人士被拘留。

Trial Begins for Chinese Anti-Corruption Activists

Three Chinese anti-corruption activists go on trial Monday in a case that underscores the government's intolerance of open dissent.

The trial of Liu Ping, Wei Zhongping and Li Sihua is taking place under heavy security in the southern province of Jiangxi, where the three staged a protest in April. They face charges of illegal assembly, of gathering a crowd to disrupt order in a public place, and using an "evil cult" to undermine the law.

The trio are part of a grassroots citizens movement called the New Citizens Movement, which has called for officials to disclose their personal assets. At least a dozen members of the group have been detained in recent months for their activities.

**报道：美国已停止对默克尔及其他一些外国领导人的电话监听**

美国一家大报说，美国总统奥巴马在将近五年时间里不知道本国情报人员监听外国领导人的电话，其中包括德国总理默克尔。报道还说，监听项目现在已经停止。

华尔街日报在星期一发表的一篇报道中援引未透露姓名的美国官员的话说，奥巴马数月前下令进行内部审查时，才得知外国领导人的电话受到监听。

华尔街日报说，在审查过程中发现美国国家安全局一直对35位外国领导人进行电话监听，而在白宫得知这一行动后，国安局就停止了大部分监听行动。

有关官员说，国安局实施的监听行动非常多，全部向总统汇报是不切实际的。

但德国《星期日图片报》援引未透露姓名的美国国安局官员的话说，奥巴马总统2010年曾收到国安局的简报，通知他美国情报人员在监听默克尔总理的移动电话通讯。

美国国安局否认奥巴马总统曾讨论据称涉及监听默克尔电话的行动。

Report: US Ended Spying of Merkel, Others

A leading U.S. newspaper says U.S. President Barack Obama went nearly five years without knowing that his own spies were bugging the phones of world leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and that the program has now ended.

The Wall Street Journal, in a report Monday citing anonymous U.S. officials, says President Obama learned of the snooping after ordering an internal review a few months ago.

The newspaper account says the review uncovered the U.S. National Security Agency had tapped the phones of 35 world leaders, and that the NSA ended most of the program after the White House learned of the operation.

Officials said the NSA has so many eavesdropping operations under way that it would not have been practical to brief the president on all of them.

However, the German newspaper Bild am Sonntag quoted an unnamed official of the NSA as saying President Obama received an NSA briefing in 2010, informing him that U.S. spies were monitoring Chancellor Merkel's mobile communications.

The NSA has since denied the president ever discussed alleged operations involving Chancellor Merkel.
