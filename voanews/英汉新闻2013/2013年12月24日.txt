**日本为联合国南苏丹维和使命提供弹药**

日本为联合国南苏丹维和使命提供了一批弹药，这是日本自二战结束以来首次为外国军队提供军火。

日本说，应联合国的要求，日本于星期一晚间向韩国军方交付了一万发子弹。韩国军人参加国际维和部队，应对可能再度爆发内战的南苏丹的暴力。

按照日本的和平宪法，日本应自行禁止出口军火。但东京官员说，法律允许日本在内阁批准的情况下为联合国维和行动提供军火。

日本首相安倍晋三曾经表示，他愿修改宪法，以便在世界各地实行更积极的和平政策。

安倍晋三还提议放松已经实行数十年的有关出口、研制及生产日本武器的禁令。

**Japan Provides Ammunition for UN Mission in Sudan**

Japan has provided a shipment of ammunition to a United Nations peacekeeping mission in troubled South Sudan, making it the first time since World War Two that Tokyo has given arms to a foreign military.

Responding to requests by the U.N., Japan said it gave 10,000 bullets late Monday to the South Korean military, which is part of an international force dealing with violence that threatens to return South Sudan to civil war.

Japan has a pacifist constitution and is subject to a self-imposed ban on arms exports. But Tokyo officials say the law allows the provision of arms as part of U.N. peacekeeping operations, with approval by the cabinet.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said he would like to revise the constitution to allow for what he calls a more "proactive peace policy" around the world.

He has also proposed relaxing the decades-old ban on the export, development and production of Japanese weapons.

**联合国将就加强南苏丹维和兵力进行表决**

美国说，联合国安理会所有成员国都支持一项有关派遣5千5百名维和人员到南苏丹保护平民免遭更多暴力的提议。

联合国安理会将于星期二下午就一项决议案进行表决。在联合国秘书长潘基文提出上述提议后，这项决议案规定将非洲其他地区的联合国维和部队派到南苏丹。

美国常驻联合国代表鲍尔星期一晚间说，南苏丹目前面临危局，南苏丹领导人要么选择对话，要么让国家陷于分裂。

南苏丹总统基尔星期一会见美国特使布思时说，他希望在没有任何先决条件的情况下
与前副总统马查尔进行谈判。

南苏丹外交部长本杰明对美国之音说，基尔总统向议会强调指出，他决不会再把南苏丹推向战争，谈判是结束暴力的唯一途径。

**UN to Vote on Bolstering South Sudan Peacekeeping Force**

The United States says all members of the U.N. Security Council support a proposal to send 5,500 peacekeepers to South Sudan in order to protect civilians from worsening violence.

The Security Council is due to vote Tuesday afternoon on a resolution to transfer troops from other U.N. missions in Africa, following the proposal from U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon.

U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power said late Monday that South Sudan is "in jeopardy" and that its leaders can either choose to engage in dialogue or tear the nation apart.

South Sudan President Salva Kiir said Monday in a meeting with U.S. special envoy for South Sudan Donald Booth that he is willing to hold talks with his former vice president Riek Machar without preconditions.

The country's Foreign Minister Barnaba Marial Benjamin told VOA that Mr. Kiir stressed in remarks to parliament that he will never again take South Sudan to war and that talks are the way to end the violence.
