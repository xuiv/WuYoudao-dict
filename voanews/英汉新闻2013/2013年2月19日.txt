**美国公司发现中国军队与网络入侵活动有关**

一个总部设在美国的互联网安全公司指责中国政府直接参与针对美国企业、政府及重要基础设施的一种复杂尖端的网络入侵活动。

麦迪安公司星期二发表一份60页的报告，详细列举了中国境内一个电脑黑客组织进行的数十次入侵。麦迪安说，该组织依靠来自政府的直接支持来从事持久而广泛的网络间谍活动。

麦迪安说，这个被称为“APT1”的组织在以往七年期间从将近150个机构的网络中窃取了大量数据，其中大部分机构在美国。

麦迪安说，该公司追踪这个组织的活动，发现其来源在上海附近中国人民解放军61398秘密部队驻地周边的地区，互联网安全专家以前就曾发现该地区与网络入侵有关联。

中国没有对这一报告发表评论。但中国当局过去曾经否认参与这类活动，并表示自己也是网络入侵的受害者。

** US Firm Links Chinese Army to Cyber Attacks**


A U.S.-based Internet security group is accusing the Chinese government of direct involvement in a sophisticated campaign of cyber attacks against American businesses, government and critical infrastructure.

A 60-page report released Tuesday by Mandiant details dozens of attacks by a China-based hacker group it says is using "direct government support" to wage a "long-running and extensive cyber espionage campaign."

Mandiant says the group, referred to as APT1, has stolen massive amounts of data from nearly 150 organizations, mostly located in the U.S., over the past seven years.

It says it has traced the activities of the group to a Shanghai neighborhood surrounding the headquarters of the People's Liberation Army's secretive unit 61398, which Internet security experts previously linked to cyber attacks.

China has not responded to the report. But in the past, it has said has denied such activity, saying it is also a victim of cyber attacks.

**南非法庭为皮斯托利斯申请保释举行听证**

南非奥运径赛选手皮斯托利斯在比勒陀利亚一家法院申请保释，目前法庭在做保释听证。皮斯托利斯涉嫌上星期杀死他的女友斯廷坎普。

检方希望在以预谋杀人罪起诉皮斯托利斯期间对他进行关押。

皮斯托利斯的家人说，有关这一案件的证据完全不支持谋杀的说法。

调查人员说，斯廷坎普上星期四清晨在皮斯托利斯家中被一支9毫米口径手枪击中四次，这支手枪的注册人是皮斯托利斯。

星期二，斯廷坎普的家人在伊丽莎白港为这位模特举行了葬礼。

在南非，皮斯托利斯被视为体育英雄和国家象征。他去年8月创造了历史，成为第一位参加奥运赛跑比赛的双腿截肢选手。
** Pistorius in Court for Bail Hearing**

South African Olympic runner Oscar Pistorius is in a Pretoria court for a bail hearing in connection with the killing last week of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.

Prosecutors want Pistorius to remain in custody as they pursue charges of pre-meditated murder against him.

Pistorius' family says the evidence in the case strongly refutes "any murder at all."

Investigators say Steenkamp was shot four times inside the athlete's home early last Thursday by a 9-millimeter pistol registered to Pistorius.

Steenkamp's family is holding a private funeral for the model Tuesday in Port Elizabeth.

Pistorius is regarded as a sports hero and national icon in South Africa. He made history in August when he became the first double amputee to run at the Olympics.
