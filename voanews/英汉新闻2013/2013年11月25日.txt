**中国防空新规定受到的批评加剧**

日本首相安倍晋三说，中国宣布设立的防空识别区包括有争议岛屿空域，这是危险的举动，可能导致严重问题。

安倍晋三在日本国会星期一召开的会议上说，中国的防空识别区是不可实施的。他还表示，这一举措在所有日本空域都不具有效性，而且应当取消。

中国星期日宣布新规定，要求所有进入防空识别区的飞机说明身份，并应服从北京的指挥。

中国已经拒绝接受美国和日本针对北京宣布设立防空识别区所提出的批评。

中国国防部星期一说，这些批评是没有根据和不负责任的，并说设立防空识别区属于中国的权限。

日本星期日向中国正式提出抗议，指责中国使围绕有争议岛屿的日中紧张局势升级。日本和中国分别将这些岛屿称为“尖阁诸岛”和“钓鱼岛”。

Criticism Escalates Over China's New Airspace Defense Rules

Japan's prime minister has called China's declaration of an air defense identification zone that includes the area above disputed islands a dangerous move that could cause serious problems.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told a session of parliament Monday that the air defense zone is not enforceable. He added that the measures have no validity whatsoever in Japan and should be revoked.

China announced Saturday new rules that require all aircraft in the zone to identify themselves and obey all commands from Beijing.

China has so far rejected criticism from the U.S. and Japan on Beijing's imposition of the rules.

China's Defense Ministry said Monday that criticism was unfounded and irresponsible. The ministry said it is within the country's rights to set up an air defense zone in the area.

Japan filed a formal protest on Saturday, criticizing China for escalating bilateral tensions over the Senkaku islands, called the Daioyus in China.

Qatar, Kuwait Praise Iran Nuclear Deal

Qatar and Kuwait have joined the nations praising the nuclear agreement struck between Iran and a group of world powers, while Israel is criticizing the pact.

The deal reached in Geneva early Sunday calls for Iran to limit its enrichment of uranium and freeze reactor construction. In return, the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany agreed to ease some international sanctions on Iran's economy.

Qatar's foreign ministry welcomed the deal in a statement late Sunday, characterizing it as a step toward ensuring peace and security in the region. Qatar also called for making the Middle East a "nuclear-weapon-free zone."

Kuwait also welcomed the agreement, with Foreign Undersecretary Khaled Al-Jarallah telling the state-run KUNA news agency that he hoped it would lead to a permanent deal to defuse tension and ensure regional security.
