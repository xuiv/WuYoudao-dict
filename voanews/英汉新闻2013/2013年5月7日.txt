**美国务卿克里抵达俄罗斯**

美国国务卿克里已经抵达俄罗斯，就叙利亚内战和其他问题举行会谈。

预计克里将在莫斯科会晤俄罗斯总统普京。

之后，克里将和俄罗斯外长拉夫罗夫举行全面的双边会议。预计他们将讨论范围广泛的一系列问题，包括叙利亚、伊朗、朝鲜核武项目、阿富汗及贸易问题。

克里和拉夫罗夫过去几个月来已经会晤过多次，但是这将是克里2月份就任国务卿以来首次对莫斯科进行为期两天的访问。下个月，美国总统奥巴马和俄罗斯总统普京将在八大国高峰会上会晤。

美俄双方在如何处理叙利亚反对派问题的最佳方案上一直意见不合。俄罗斯和中国一再使用他们在联合国安理会的否决权让联合国无法对叙利亚总统阿萨德采取更加严厉的行动。

**U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry Arrives in Russia **
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has arrived in Russia for talks on the war in Syria and other issues.

He is scheduled to meet Tuesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.

Later, Kerry will hold a full bilateral meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. They are expected to discuss a wide range of issues including Syria, the Iranian and North Korean nuclear programs, Afghanistan and trade.

Kerry and Lavrov have met several times in the past few months, but this will be Kerry's first trip to Moscow since taking the post of secretary of state in February. The two-day visit comes ahead of next month's meeting between U.S. President Barack Obama and Mr. Putin on the sidelines of the G-8 summit.

The United States and Russia have been at odds about how best to deal with the rebellion in Syria. Russia and China have repeatedly used their U.N. Security Council veto to block tougher United Nations action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

**美国官员：朝鲜从发射场移走两枚中程导弹**

美国官员相信，朝鲜从紧急发射台移走两枚中程导弹，此举显然是进一步缓和朝鲜半岛的紧张局势。

不愿透露姓名的华盛顿国防官员星期一晚间说，平壤最近把两枚舞水端导弹从东海的一个发射场移走。韩国媒体也报道了这一动态。

几个星期来，华盛顿警告说，朝鲜可能会发射尚未试射的舞水端导弹。这种导弹的射程可达3500公里，能达到该地区的几个美国目标。

白宫亚洲事务部资深主任罗素说，现在就把这一举动作为“好消息”来庆祝，还为时过早。他警告说，美国官员还不能排除朝鲜进行试射。

朝鲜在连续几个星期发出要对美国和韩国发动核攻击和常规攻击的威胁之后，已经逐渐减弱了叫嚣的强度。

与此同时，韩国总统朴槿惠星期二将在华盛顿会晤美国总统奥巴马。预计双方的会谈可能主要讨论平壤问题。

**NKorea Moves Missiles From Launch Site: US Officials**

U.S. officials believe North Korea has removed two mid-range missiles from imminent-launch status, in an apparent further easing of tensions on the Korean peninsula.

Speaking anonymously late Monday, Washington defense officials said Pyongyang recently moved the two Musudan missiles from a launch site on the country's east coast. South Korean media are also reporting the move.

Washington had for weeks warned North Korea could launch the untested Musudan missiles, which have a range of up to 3,500 kilometers and could reach several U.S. targets in the region.

Daniel Russel, the White House Senior Director for Asian Affairs, says it is premature to celebrate the move as "good news," warning that U.S. officials cannot rule out a test.

North Korea has gradually reduced the intensity of its rhetoric, following weeks of threats of nuclear and conventional attacks against the U.S. and South Korea.

It also comes just before South Korean President Park Geun-hye meets Tuesday in Washington with U.S. President Barack Obama, for talks likely to focus on Pyongyang.
