**缅甸难民船倾覆 多人恐葬身大海**

联合国说，一艘疏散多达150名罗兴亚穆斯林难民的船只在缅甸西部海岸外海倾覆。与此同时，成千上万的人为了躲避即将登陆的飓风，正匆忙逃离低洼地区的难民营。

联合国人道事务协调办公室星期二说，一艘拖着另外两只船的船在缅甸的诺开邦帕科塔乌镇触礁后翻覆，失踪人数不详，但很多人恐怕已经丧生。

这次事件发生在星期一，当时这些难民们正被运往联合国办公室所说的缅甸那个地区的“其他穆斯林社区”。

救援机构继续警告说，在热带飓风“马哈森”星期三晚间登陆缅甸西部海岸和孟加拉国时，特大洪水和泥石流可能会引发人道主义灾难。

目前处境最危险的是居住在诺开邦洪水易发地区肮脏难民营的成千上万的难民，其中大多数是罗兴亚穆斯林。这些人在去年导致近200人丧生的佛教徒和穆斯林的暴力事件后无家可归。

**Burmese Refugee Boat Capsizes, Many Feared Dead**
The United Nations says a boat evacuating as many as 150 Rohingya Muslim refugees has capsized off the coast of western Burma, as tens of thousands scramble to leave low-lying refugee camps in preparation for an incoming cyclone.

The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Tuesday a boat towing two other boats struck rocks near Pauktaw township in Burma's Rakhine state. It said an unknown number of people were missing, with many feared dead.

The incident happened Monday, as the refugees were being moved to what the U.N. office called "other Muslim host communities" in that part of Burma.

Aid agencies continue to warn of a possible humanitarian disaster that could result from heavy flooding and mudslides when tropical Cyclone Mahasen hits the coast of western Burma and Bangladesh late Wednesday.

Most at risk are the tens of thousands of people, mostly Rohingya Muslims, living in squalid refugee camps in flood-prone areas of Rakhine. They were displaced following Buddhist-Muslim violence last year that killed nearly 200 people.

**普京和内塔尼亚胡举行叙利亚问题会谈**

俄罗斯总统普京星期二将欢迎到访的以色列总理内塔尼亚胡，着重讨论叙利亚的局势。

以色列和西方大国对俄罗斯可能向叙利亚出售先进的防空武器表示担忧，因为这将使对阿萨德总统军队的任何可能空中打击复杂化。

俄罗斯外长拉夫罗夫上星期说，根据双方签订的合同，俄罗斯政府将履行对叙利亚的军售，但是他没有说明先进的S-300导弹系统是否在内。

与此同时，国际社会正在继续努力安排召开一个叙利亚问题的国际和平会议。这个会议是俄罗斯和美国上星期提议召开的。

**Putin, Netanyahu to Hold Syria-Focused Talks**

Russian President Vladimir Putin hosts Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for talks Tuesday focused on the situation in Syria.

Israel and Western powers are concerned about potential Russian sales of advanced anti-aircraft weapons to Syria, which would complicate any possible airstrikes against President Bashar al-Assad's forces.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said last week his government is completing arms sales to Syria under existing contracts, but did not say if advanced S-300 missile batteries were included.

The talks come as efforts continue to arrange an international peace conference on Syria, which Russia and the United States proposed last week.
