The death toll from the collapse of building that housed several garment factories in Bangladesh has jumped to 160 as emergency workers continue to search for survivors. About 1,000 people were injured in the accident.

Officials said Thursday that many people remain trapped under the ruins of the building in a suburb of Dhaka.

In November, a fire at a garment factory killed more than 100 workers, raising an outcry about the nation's garment industry.
