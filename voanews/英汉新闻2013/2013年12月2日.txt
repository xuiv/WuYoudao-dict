**拜登出访亚洲**

美国副总统拜登对亚洲进行为期六天的访问，目前美国和中国的关系因中国最近宣布设立防空识别区而趋于紧张。
拜登星期一首先访问日本，随后还将访问中国和韩国。白宫说，拜登此次出访是为了再次强调美国作为太平洋地区强国的地位、促进经贸利益以及致力于调整美国在亚太地区的外交政策。
拜登将会晤中国国家主席习近平和李克强总理。白宫说，拜登将寻求推动美中两国的高层接触，这种接触是美中关系的一个特点。
白宫同时表示，拜登还将讨论美方关注的问题，包括地区紧张局势。
上个月，北京宣布在中国和日本都宣称拥有主权的太平洋岛屿上空设立防空识别区。
中国要求所有飞越该空域的飞机通报飞行计划，而日本拒绝这样做。
美国无视中国的要求，已派遣军用飞机飞越该空域，但建议美国商业航空公司向中国通报飞行计划。

Biden Heading to Asia

U.S. Vice President Joe Biden is on a six-day visit to Asia at a time of increased tensions with China over a just-declared air defense zone.

Biden begins his trip Monday in Japan and will also visit China and South Korea. The White House says his visit is aimed at reaffirming the U.S. as a Pacific power, promoting economic and trade interests, and its commitment to rebalancing U.S. foreign policy in the Asia-Pacific.

Biden will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang. The White House says Biden will seek to advance the high-level engagement that is the hallmark of U.S.-Chinese relations.

But it says Biden will also discuss what it calls areas of concern, including regional tensions.

Last month, China declared an air defense zone in the Pacific over islands claimed by both China and Japan.

China is demanding all planes submit flight plans before crossing the zone. Japan is refusing to comply.

The United States has already flown military jets across the zone ignoring China's demand, but is recommending U.S. commercial airliners inform the Chinese of their flight plans.

**泰国总理称反对派的要求违宪**

泰国总理英拉说，反对派的要求属于违宪，因此她不能予以满足。
英拉在电视转播的星期一记者会上证实，她星期日晚间与反政府抗议领导者素贴特素班进行了会谈。她说，这次会晤是在军方支持下进行的。泰国军方表示在这场冲突中保持中立。
英拉对记者们说，素贴特素班要求她辞职、解散议会以及把政府权力交给一个不是通过选举产生的“人民委员会”，而依照法律，她不可能接受这些要求。
英拉说，她愿做自己所能做的一切来使人民感到幸福，但她的所作所为必须符合宪法。
在英拉发表上述评论之际，警察继续使用催泪弹、高压水龙和橡皮子弹阻止数千名抗议者占领曼谷的政府办公大楼。
抗议者原本把星期日定为“胜利日”，计划在这一天推翻英拉总理的政府，但他们未能达到占领政府大楼总理办公室以及其他政府机构的目的。

Thai PM Calls Opposition Demands Unconstitutional

Thailand's prime minister says she cannot comply with demands by the anti-government opposition because they are unconstitutional.

In a televised news conference on Monday, Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra confirmed that she met with anti-government protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban late Sunday. She said the meeting was held under the auspices of the military, which says it is neutral in the conflict.

She told reporters that Suthep's demands that she resign, dissolve parliament and turn the government over to an unelected "people's council" was not possible under the law.

The prime minister said she was willing to do anything she could to make people happy, but what she could do must be legal under the constitution.

Her comments came as police continued to fire tear gas, water cannon and rubber bullets at thousands of protesters trying to seize government buildings in Bangkok.

The protesters had set Sunday as "Victory Day" to topple Ms. Yingluck's government, but failed to achieve their goal of seizing the prime minister's office at Government House or occupying state buildings.
