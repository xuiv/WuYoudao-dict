**原中国铁道部长被判死缓**

北京一家法庭以受贿罪和滥用职权罪，判处原铁道部长刘志军死刑，缓期两年执行。

官方的新华社报道，这家法庭星期一还作出裁决，没收刘志军的个人全部财产，剥夺他的政治权利终身。在中国，死缓通常被改判为终身监禁。

根据起诉书，1986年到2011年间，刘志军接受了至少1000万美元的贿赂，以帮助他人职务升迁或者承揽工程。刘志军去年2月被开除公职，稍后被开除出共产党。

起诉书还说，刘志军对“公共财产和国家与人民利益的巨大损失”负有责任。

**Former China Rail Minster Given Suspended Death Sentence**

A Beijing court has given China's former railways minister a two-year suspended death sentence for bribery and abuse of power.

The official Xinhua news agency says the court also ruled Monday that Liu Zhijun would lose all his personal property and be deprived of political rights for life. In China, a suspended death sentence is usually commuted to life in prison.

According to the indictment, Liu accepted more than $10 million in bribes to help people win promotions or contracts between 1986 and 2011. He was fired in February of last year and later kicked out of the Communist Party.

The indictment also said that Liu was responsible for "huge losses of public assets and of the interests of the state and people."

**韩亚航空：出事飞机驾驶员正在接受波音777驾驶培训**

韩亚航空公司说，星期六在旧金山机场发生坠机事故的飞机驾驶员正在接受驾驶波音777客机的培训，并且是第一次尝试在旧金山机场降落。

这家韩国的航空公司星期一说，这名驾驶员有43个小时驾驶波音777客机的经验和总共超过9000小时的飞行经验。一名驾驶这种机型经验丰富的飞行员作为教官和客机的副驾驶。

美国调查人员说，现在就确定事故发生的原因还为时太早，不过，这驾出事客机在接近跑道时飞行速度“远远低于”标准速度，飞行员曾试图停止着陆。

美国国家交通安全委员会主席黛博拉•赫斯曼星期天说， “停止”的口头要求是在出事前1.5秒的时候发出的，但为时过晚，来不及避免导致两人死亡、数十人受伤的事故。

**Asiana: Pilot in Deadly Crash Training on 777 Jets**

Asiana Airlines says the pilot of a plane that crashed Saturday at San Francisco airport was still in training flying a Boeing 777, and was trying to land that type of aircraft at the site for the first time.

The South Korea-based airline said Monday the pilot had 43 hours of experience in the 777, and more than 9,000 hours of flight time overall. A pilot more experienced with the aircraft was acting as a trainer and co-pilot on the flight.

U.S. investigators say it is too early to say what caused the crash, but that the plane was flying "significantly below" its target speed as it approached the runway and that the pilot tried to abort the landing.

National Transportation Safety Board chair Deborah Hersman said Sunday the verbal "abort" request came just 1.5 seconds before impact -- too late to avoid the crash that killed two people and injured dozens more.
