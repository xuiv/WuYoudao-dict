**24名埃及警察遇害 律师称穆巴拉克可能获释**

埃及安全官员说，激进分子在西奈半岛打死了至少24名警察。自埃及军方上月罢免穆尔西总统以来，西奈半岛的暴力事件不断增多。

此次袭击发生在星期一凌晨，激进分子在毗邻加沙地带边境的拉法赫市附近伏击了警察们乘坐的两辆公交车。

另外前总统穆巴拉克的律师说，穆巴拉克很快就会获释。

埃尔迪波说，一家埃及法院已经判决对穆巴拉克的腐败指控不成立。穆巴拉克及其儿子被控腐败，因为有人说，他们为修建总统府而挪用公款。

穆巴拉克律师的说法无法得到埃及司法部门的证实，不过法新社援引司法界的消息来源说，穆巴拉克会因为另一案件的指控而继续被关押。

85岁的穆巴拉克仍然面临在2011年的反政府抗议活动中未能阻止对抗议者的杀戮的指控，可能再次接受审判。那场运动推翻了穆巴拉克政府。

埃及内政部星期天还报道说，在开罗北部发生的一起未遂越狱事件中，36名支持穆尔西的穆斯林兄弟会成员被催泪瓦斯窒息而死。

Militants Kill 24 Egyptian Police in Sinai Attack

Militants have targeted and killed at least 24 policemen in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, which has seen an increase in violence since the Egyptian military ousted Islamist Mohamed Morsi from the presidency last month.

The attackers ambushed buses carrying the policemen early Monday near the city of Rafah, along the border with the Gaza Strip.

Also Monday, a lawyer for former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said his client will soon be released.

Fareed el-Deeb said an Egyptian court had cleared Mr. Mubarak of corruption charges, stemming from allegations he and his sons embezzled money for presidential palaces.

The claims could not be immediately confirmed by judicial officials. But the French news agency (AFP), quoting judicial sources, reported that Mr. Mubarak will remain in custody on charges in an additional case.

The 85-year-old Mubarak still faces a retrial on charges he failed to stop the killing of protesters during the popular revolt that swept him from power in 2011.

Word of the killing of the police officers and the possible release of Mr. Mubarak come one day after the interior ministry reported 36 members of the pro-Morsi Muslim Brotherhood were suffocated by tear gas during an attempted prison break in northern Cairo.



**新西兰发现第二种出口中国乳制品受到污染**

准备运往中国的第二种受到污染的新西兰乳制品被禁止出口。几星期前，出口中国的感染肉毒杆菌的新西兰乳制品被禁运。
新西兰农业管理机构星期一说，在发现四批乳铁蛋白托运货品的硝酸盐含量超标后，已经吊销其出口许可证。乳铁蛋白可以增强婴儿的抗菌能力。
生产这些乳铁蛋白制品的威士兰乳业公司说，中国消费者没有接触到这些产品。
新西兰乳业巨头恒天然集团7月底宣布，向中国出口的乳制品含有肉毒杆菌。


New Zealand Finds Another Contaminated Milk Product Destined for China

A second contaminated New Zealand milk product destined for China has been banned, just weeks after shipments of milk containing botulism bacteria were halted.

New Zealand's agricultural regulator said Monday that it had cancelled export certificates for four consignments of lactoferrin, which provides antibacterial activity to human infants, after it was found to contain excessive levels of nitrate.

The producer, Westland Milk Products, said none of the batches had reached Chinese consumers.

New Zealand dairy giant Fonterra announced at the end of July that milk slated for export to China contained bacteria that causes botulism.
