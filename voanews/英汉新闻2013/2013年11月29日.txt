**中国派战机进入东海防空识别区**

中国军方星期四表示，已派战机在新设立的东海防空识别区执行巡逻任务。在此数小时前，日本和韩国战机进入该空域，对北京进行挑战。

中国官方的新华社说，已派出几架战斗机和早期预警飞机在东海有争议岛屿上空执行中国军方发言人所说的防空巡逻任务。这些岛屿在东京的控制之下，而北京也宣称对这些岛屿拥有主权。

中国的反应加剧了围绕这些无人居住岛屿的国际紧张局势。日本和中国分别将这些岛屿称为“尖阁列岛”和“钓鱼岛”。

日本、美国和韩国都拒绝承认中国宣布设立的防空识别区。本星期早些时候，美国派遣两架B-52轰炸机飞越东海有争议岛屿，以此强调对有关问题的立场。依照美日安保条约，美国有义务保护日本。

在美国B-52轰炸机飞越有争议岛屿的两天前，中国国防部警告说，所有进入该空域的飞机都必须通报身份并服从中方的命令。

China Sends Jets Into Air Defense Zone After Flights by Japan, S. Korea

China's military said it sent warplanes Thursday to patrol its newly-declared air defense identification zone in the East China Sea, just hours after Japan and South Korea challenged Beijing by flying military planes into the zone.

China's official Xinhua news agency said several fighter jets and early warning aircraft had been sent on what a military spokesman described as defensive air patrols over disputed islands controlled by Tokyo and claimed by Beijing.

The Chinese response raises the stakes in an international standoff over the the uninhabited islands, known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China.

Japan, the United States and South Korea have all refused to recognize the Chinese-declared air zone. Earlier this week, the United States, which is obligated by treaty to defend Japan, sought to underscore its position by flying two B-52 bombers over the islands.

The unarmed U.S. flights came two days after the Chinese Defense Ministry warned that all aircraft in the zone must identify themselves and obey all orders from Beijing.
