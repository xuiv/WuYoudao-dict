**人权观察：叙利亚政府军非法袭击平民**

人权观察说，叙利亚蓄意对平民进行“非法”的、不加区别的袭击。该组织敦促国际社会向叙利亚政府施加压力，停止这种行为。

人权观察星期四发表一份报告，列举了叙利亚政府军于去年8月至12月对反对派控制地区阿勒颇、伊德利卜以及拉塔基亚发动的59次空袭。人权观察说，包括针对面包店和医院的空袭共导致152人死亡，看来这种空袭是一个有计划活动的组成部分，而这种行为等同于反人类罪行。

人权观察的报告说，这些空袭包括使用了无制导炸弹、战机以及高空飞行直升机，空袭时无法区别地面上的平民和战斗人员。

人权观察还说，四名倒戈的叙利亚空军军人对该组织说，他们不具备“在城市地区确认并打击特定军事目标”的技术。

**HRW: Syrian Forces Unlawfully Attacking Civilians**

Human Rights Watch says Syria is carrying out "unlawful" deliberate and indiscriminate attacks against civilians, and is urging the international community to pressure the government to stop.

The group released a report Thursday describing 59 air strikes in opposition areas of Aleppo, Idlib and Latakia between August and December last year. Human Rights Watch says those attacks - some hitting bakeries and hospitals killed 152 civilians, and appear to be part of a systematic campaign that amounts to crimes against humanity.

The report says the air strikes included the use of unguided bombs, fighter jets and high-flying helicopters without the ability to tell the difference between civilians and combatants on the ground.

Additionally, Human Rights Watch says four Syrian Air Force defectors told the group that they lacked the technology to "identify and target specific military objectives in urban areas."
