**南华早报：中国当局对周永康展开腐败调查**


一家香港报纸说，中国当局已经决定对退休的政界高层人物周永康展开腐败调查。直到去年，周永康还是中国的高层领导人之一。

南华早报星期五说，“熟悉中共思维方式”的消息人士证实了有关对周永康展开调查的决定。

现年70岁的周永康于2007年至2012年担任中共中央政治局常委。中共中央政治局是中国的最高决策机构。周永康还曾担任中国庞大的安保系统的主管。

中国政府尚未对有关调查周永康的消息发表评论。如果消息得到证实，这将是中共几十年来首次因经济犯罪对一名前任或现任政治局常委进行调查。

香港城市大学政治学教授郑宇硕对美国之音说，他认为，去年才掌权的国家主席习近平不大可能会寻求对这样一位名声显赫而且人脉广的前官员提出腐败指控。

China to Launch Corruption Probe Into Former Senior Politician: Report


A Hong Kong newspaper says China has decided to start a corruption investigation into retired politician Zhou Yongkang, who until last year was one of the country's elite leaders.

The South China Morning Post on Friday said the decision to launch the investigation was confirmed by sources "familiar with the leadership thinking" of China's Communist Party.

The 70-year-old Zhou was a member of the elite Politburo Standing Committee, China's highest governing body, from 2007 to 2012. He also oversaw China's sprawling state security apparatus.

China's government has not commented on any investigation. If confirmed, it would be the first time in decades that the party has investigated economic crimes by a former or current Standing Committee member.

Joseph Cheng, a professor of political science at the City University of Hong Kong, tells VOA he thinks it is not likely that President Xi Jinping, who just came to power last year, would pursue graft charges against such a prominent, well-connected ex-official.



**近5千名消防人员试图扑灭加州野火**

美国西部加利福尼亚州的消防人员表示，人迹罕至、地势险峻以及极强的火势阻碍消防队员控制大规模野火火势的努力。这场野火正威胁着一个著名的国家公园。

将近5,000名消防队员正与这场称为“环火”的大火拼搏，可是不得依赖飞机来减缓火势的蔓延。

美国林务局星期五表示，熊熊的大火波及800多平方公里的地区，烧毁了大约82,000公顷的土地，其中包括优胜美地国家公园的部分地区。

大约三分之一的火势已经得到控制。当局使用一架类似于美军在阿富汗使用的无人驾驶的军机，来提供有关新的火势的信息，否则他们无法观察全面的火势。

美国林务局说，消防队员预计于9月20号以前能全面控制环火的火势。

Nearly 5,000 Firefighters Battling California Wildfire

Firefighters in ((the western U.S. state of)) California say inaccessible, steep terrain and extreme fire behavior are hampering efforts to contain a massive wildfire that is threatening a famous national park.

Nearly 5,000 firefighters are battling the Rim Fire but have had to rely heavily on aircraft to slow the spread of the fire.

The U.S. Forest Service said Friday the massive blaze has swelled to more that 800 square kilometers and consumed about 82,000 hectares of land, including some of Yosemite National Park.

The fire is about one-third contained. Authorities are using an unmanned military Predator drone, similar to those used in Afghanistan, to provide information on new fires they would otherwise not be able to see.

The U.S. Forest Service says firefighters expect to fully contain the Rim Fire by September 20.
