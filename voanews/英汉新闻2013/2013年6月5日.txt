**习近平访问墨西哥 双方承诺加强合作**

在中国国家主席习近平开始对墨西哥进行为期三天的访问之际，中国和墨西哥承诺加强双边合作以及扩大贸易关系。

习近平星期二会晤墨西哥总统涅托后表示，中墨两国签署了范围广泛的合作协议。

中墨两国就墨西哥猪肉和龙舌兰酒进入中国市场达成协议。习近平表示，中国计划不久将从墨西哥购买价值10亿美元的商品，但未做具体说明。

墨西哥目前正设法缩小与中国的巨额贸易逆差。2012年，墨西哥进口了570亿美元的中国商品，同时对中国的出口额仅为57亿美元。

习近平这次访问的部分目的是恢复在前墨西哥总统卡尔德龙任期内处于紧张状态的中墨关系，卡尔德龙曾于2011年会晤西藏流亡精神领袖达赖喇嘛。

**China, Mexico Promise Greater Bilateral Cooperation as Xi Visits**

China and Mexico promised greater bilateral cooperation and expanded commercial ties, as Chinese President Xi Jinping started a three-day visit to the Latin American country.

After meeting Tuesday with his Mexican counterpart Enrique Pena Nieto, President Xi said the two countries signed a wide-range of cooperation agreements.

The two countries reached agreements on access for Mexican pork and tequila to the Chinese market. Mr. Xi also said China plans to soon purchase $1 billion worth of Mexican goods, but did not elaborate.

The visit was partly aimed at restoring Mexico-China ties that were strained during the administration of former Mexican President Felipe Calderon, who welcomed Tibet's exiled spiritial leader, the Dalai Lama in 2011.

**叙利亚政府军夺回库赛尔控制权**

叙利亚政府军在邻国黎巴嫩真主党战斗人员的支持下，已经完全收复了黎巴嫩边境附近战略重镇库赛尔的控制权。近三个星期前，叙利亚政府对库赛尔发动攻势。

叙利亚国家电视台星期三说，叙利亚军队击败了“恐怖分子” ，叙利亚政府把试图推翻阿萨德总统的反对派武装人员称为“恐怖分子”。

反政府武装则表示，他们撤离了库赛尔。反政府武装控制库赛尔一年多。

库赛尔位于连接首都大马士革和地中海沿岸的一条重要公路旁，距离反政府武装的黎巴嫩边境走私路线不远。

黎巴嫩真主党激进分子参与了库赛尔的战斗，国际社会因此而更加关注叙利亚冲突的蔓延态势。联合国人权理事会上星期通过一项决议，谴责阿萨德政府在库赛尔利用外国战斗人员。

与此同时，联合国、俄罗斯和美国的官员星期三在日内瓦举行会谈，争取召集一次旨在结束叙利亚危机的和平会议。

**Syrian Army Regains Control of Qusair**

Syrian forces backed by Hezbollah fighters from neighboring Lebanon have regained full control of Qusair, a strategic city on the Lebanese border where government troops launched an offensive nearly three weeks ago.

Syrian state television said Wednesday the army had defeated "terrorists" -- a term the government uses to describe opposition fighters trying to oust President Bashar al-Assad.

The rebels said they withdrew from Qusair, which they had held for more than a year.
The city is located along a key highway linking the capital, Damascus, to the Mediterranean coast, and is close to rebel smuggling routes along Lebanon's border.
The fighting in Qusair drew in Hezbollah militants, raising international concerns about the spread of the Syrian conflict. Last week, the United Nations Human Rights Council approved a resolution condemning Mr. Assad's government for using "foreign fighters" in Qusair.

Meanwhile, officials from the United Nations, Russia and the United States are holding talks Wednesday in Geneva, as they try to pull together a peace conference to end the crisis.
