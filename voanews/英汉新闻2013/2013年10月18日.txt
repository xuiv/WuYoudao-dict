**斯诺登：中俄获得美国国安局机密文件的“机会为零” **

揭露美国国家安全局监视公民项目的美国前情报合同工斯诺登说，中国或俄罗斯获得美国国安局机密文件的“机会为零”。

纽约时报星期四发表了斯诺登接受该报采访的报道。斯诺登说，他把所有他获得的这类文件都交给了在香港的记者。

斯诺登说，带着这些文件飞往莫斯科不符合公众利益。

斯诺登还说，他非常熟悉中国的反间谍网络，而且美国国安局知道，他采取安全措施使中国不能得到国安局的那些机密信息。

斯诺登今年早些时候披露说，美国国安局收集美国公民的通讯记录。

斯诺登说，他发现国安局的一份内部报告，内容有关布什政府在没有得到法庭授权的情况下进行窃听，于是决定披露此事。斯诺登说，该窃听项目违反现有的监视法。

斯诺登对纽约时报说，如果政府最高级别的官员可以违反法律而不受惩罚，那么“不为人知的隐秘权力就会变得极端危险”。

斯诺登在揭露美国国安局的监听项目后逃往香港，后又飞往莫斯科。俄罗斯总统普京给予他为期一年的庇护，这激怒了希望审判斯诺登的美国。
美国国安局还没有评论斯诺登对纽约时报发表的讲话，不过国安局为其监听项目辩护说，该项目帮助挫败了几起重大的恐怖阴谋。

Snowden: 'Zero Chance' China, Russia Got Classified NSA Documents

The former U.S. intelligence contractor who disclosed that the National Security Agency spied on citizens says there is a "zero percent chance" Russia or China has classified NSA documents.

In a New York Times interview published Thursday, Edward Snowden said he gave all such documents in his possession to journalists in Hong Kong.

Snowden said taking the files with him when he fled to Moscow would not have served the public interest.

The former contractor also says he was highly familiar with Chinese cyber-counterintelligence and that the NSA knows he protected the classified information from China's spies.

Snowden revealed earlier this year that the NSA collected records of communications by U.S. citizens.

Snowden said he decided to speak out after discovering an internal NSA report, on wiretapping by the Bush administration, without court orders. Snowden said the program skirted the existing surveillance laws.

He told the Times that if the highest officials in government can break the law without punishment, then "secret powers become tremendously dangerous."

Snowden fled to Hong Kong and then to Moscow after disclosing the NSA spy program. Russian President Vladimir Putin granted him a year's asylum, angering the United States which wants to put him on trial.

The NSA has not commented on Snowden's remarks to The New York Times, but has defended its surveillance program, saying it helped foil several major terrorist plots.
