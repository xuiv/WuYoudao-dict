**India Summons Pakistani Ambassador Over Alleged Shooting**

India has summoned Pakistan's ambassador to New Delhi to register a protest over the alleged grisly killing of two Indian soldiers by Pakistani troops in the disputed border region of Kashmir.

A spokesman for India's foreign ministry announced the move Wednesday, just hours after Indian Foreign Minister Salman Khurshid called the incident "ghastly" and promised a proportionate response. Indian Defense Minister A.K. Antony later called the clash "highly provocative" and "inhuman."

India's military says its soldiers were on patrol Tuesday near the town of Mendhar when Pakistani troops crossed into Indian-controlled Kashmir and shot dead two Indian soldiers in a firefight. They say the Pakistani forces retreated after the gunbattle.

An Indian military official says a body of one of the soldiers was later found mutilated in Kashmir.

The incident happened two days after Pakistan said one of its soldiers was killed in the area.
