**奥巴马宣布枪支控制提议**

美国总统奥巴马宣布了有关枪支控制的日程安排，其中包括一系列有争议的提议，预计这些提议将开始引发与拥枪派组织及其支持者的政治角力。

奥巴马星期三在白宫宣布了这些提议，去年12月14号康涅狄克州学校枪击案26名遇害者当中一些遇害者的亲属也在场。奥巴马说，发生枪击案的那一天是他总统任期内最不幸的日子，并警告说，国会就枪支控制所采取的行动将影响到子孙后代。

这些提议包括禁止攻击型武器、对购枪者进行普遍背景调查以及加强心理保健服务。奥巴马还签署了23项政令，以便为执法机构和心理保健专业人员提供更多手段来遏制枪击暴力。

但是奥巴马面临着保守派议员和全国步枪协会的强烈反对。全国步枪协会是美国最大的坚持民众拥枪权利的游说组织。

**Obama Unveils Gun Control Proposals**

U.S. President Barack Obama has unveiled his gun control agenda with a set of controversial proposals expected to start a political fight with pro-gun groups and their supporters.

Mr. Obama announced the proposals Wednesday at the White House, joined by relatives of some of the 26 victims of the December 14 school shooting in Connecticut. He has called that day the worst of his presidency, and has warned that congressional action on gun control will resonate with future generations.

The proposals include banning assault-style weapons, universal background checks for gun sales, and boosting mental health services. The president also signed 23 executive orders to help give law enforcement and mental health professionals more tools in combating gun violence.

But he faces stiff opposition from conservative lawmakers and the nation's largest gun lobby, the National Rifle Association.

**巴基斯坦反贪局拒绝逮捕总理阿什拉夫**

巴基斯坦反贪局首脑表示，尽管最高法院下令逮捕总理阿什拉夫，但该机构已决定不逮捕他。

巴基斯坦国家问责局局长伯哈里星期四对最高法院说，他没有得到以贪污指控逮捕阿什拉夫的足够证据。

星期二，巴基斯坦最高法院下令逮捕被控参与私营发电厂交易的阿什拉夫以及其他15人。

阿什拉夫被控接受贿赂，以安排建造发电厂，解决巴基斯坦的电力短缺问题。阿什拉夫否认这些指称。

观察人士说，逮捕令问题可能使巴基斯坦政府与法院之间原本就很紧张的关系更加恶化。

**Pakistan's Anti-Corruption Bureau Refuses to Arrest Prime Minister**

The head of Pakistan's anti-corruption bureau says it has decided not to arrest Prime Minister Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, despite orders to do so by the supreme court.

Fasih Bokhari, chief of the National Accountability Bureau, told the court Thursday that he does not have sufficient evidence to arrest Mr. Ashraf on corruption charges.

On Tuesday, the supreme court ordered the arrest of the prime minister and 15 others on charges involving private power stations.

Mr. Ashraf is accused of taking bribes for arranging to build power plants to serve Pakistan's power deficiency. Mr. Ashraf has denied the allegations.

Observers say the arrest warrants could worsen the already-existing tension between the government and the courts.
