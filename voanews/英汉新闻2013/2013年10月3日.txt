**美日加强安全联盟**

按照美日两国高层官员达成的协议，美国将在日本部署一种新式导弹防御雷达，并将在太平洋地区部署无人侦察机。

美国国务卿克里、国防部长哈格尔、日本外务大臣岸田文雄和防卫大臣小野寺五典星期四在东京签署了安保防御指南，上述步骤是这项文件的部分内容。

按照这项协议，美国将部署远程“全球鹰”无人侦察机，协助监视太平洋海域的海事活动。日本与中国在太平洋有领土争端。

在未来一年期间，美国还将在日本西海岸的一个空军基地部署X波段雷达系统，以应对来自朝鲜的导弹威胁。

此外，该协议最终敲定将5千名美国海军陆战队员从冲绳移至太平洋其他地点。协议规定，日本将支付转移基地所需开支的三分之一。

US, Japan Strengthen Security Alliance

The United States will station a new missile defense radar in Japan and deploy surveillance drones in the Pacific under a deal reached by top U.S. and Japanese officials

The moves are part of renewed mutual defense guidelines signed Thursday by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, Pentagon chief Chuck Hagel, and their Japanese counterparts in Tokyo.

Under the deal, the U.S. will deploy long-range, Global Hawk reconnaissance drones to help monitor maritime activities in the Pacific, where Japan is involved in a territorial dispute with China.

The U.S. will also place an X-band radar system at Kyogamisaki air base on Japan's West coast over the next year to counter the threat of North Korean missiles.

In addition, the deal formalized a decision to relocate 5,000 U.S. Marines from Okinawa to other areas in the Pacific. It stated that Japan will pay a third of the cost of the relocation effort.

**美国联邦政府关闭进入第三天**

星期四，美国联邦政府部分关闭进入第三天，目前仍看不到化解僵局的迹象。

美国国会领袖们星期三夜间与奥巴马总统进行了一小时左右的会谈，但这次闭门会议未能就打破导致政府关闭的预算案僵局取得任何进展。

美国国会众议院议长贝纳说，奥巴马总统表示不会就恢复政府运作进行谈判。共和党人贝纳说，他告诉奥巴马总统，他希望就奥巴马医保法案的“公正性”进行讨论。

共和党人希望通过限制对联邦政府的拨款，延迟实施医保法案或不提供实施医保法案所必需的资金。

参议院民主党领袖里德说，民主党人非常愿意与共和党人就任何议题进行谈判，但必须首先通过开支预算法案，结束政府关闭的状态。

白宫说，星期三的会谈是有益的，并表示奥巴马乐见其成。举行会谈之前，奥巴马在CNBC电视频道上说，他一直在竭尽所能地与共和党人合作。奥巴马说，他感到愤慨，因为这次关闭政府是毫无必要的。

U.S. Shutdown Enters Third Day

A partial U.S. government shutdown has entered its third day Thursday with no end to the deadlock in sight.

U.S. congressional leaders met for about an hour late Wednesday with President Barack Obama, but they emerged from the closed-door session with no progress on the budget impasse that triggered the shutdown.

House Speaker John Boehner said President Obama told him he will not negotiate a deal to reopen the government. Republican Boehner said he told the president he wants a discussion of what he called the "fairness" of Mr. Obama's signature health care program, the Affordable Care Act.

Republicans have wanted to tie funding the government to a delay or defunding of the health care program.

Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said Democrats are happy to talk to the Republicans about anything they want, but only if a spending bill is passed and the government shutdown ends.

The White House called Wednesday's meeting useful and said the president is glad it took place. But before the talks, Mr. Obama told CNBC television he has "bent over backwards" to work with the Republicans. He said he is exasperated, calling the government shutdown totally unnecessary.
