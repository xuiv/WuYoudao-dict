State media say six Communist Party graft investigators will soon stand trial on intentional injury charges related to the death of Yu Qiyi, an engineer at the Wenzhou Industry Investment Group.

** US Kidnapper of Three Women Found Dead in Cell**

Prison officials in Ohio say the man who held three women captive for over a decade has been found dead.

Ariel Castro was found hanging in his prison cell late Tuesday night. Officials say the 53-year-old Castro was taken to nearby hospital for emergency treatment, where he was pronounced dead.

The former school bus driver was arrested in May after one of his female captives escaped from his Cleveland home and ran to neighbors for help. Authorities say he kidnapped the women separately between 2002 and 2004, and raped them repeatedly during their captivity. One of the women gave birth to Castro's daughter.

Castro pleaded guilty last month to over 900 criminal charges, including kidnapping and rape.

Castro was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
