**Greeks Strike because of Broadcast Cutback**

Buses and trains across Greece have come to a standstill Thursday -- part of a 24-hour, nationwide general strike called by unions to protest the government's decision to shut down state broadcaster, ERT, as part of sweeping cost-cutting measures.

The government took ERT off the air early Wednesday, after announcing the shutdown Tuesday.

Greek journalist unions have called for their members to strike until ERT is reopened.

Prime Minister Antonis Samaras is facing opposition from his coalition partners -- the socialist PASOK and the Democratic Left Party -- because of the closing.

Greece says the ERT closure is a temporary measure before a re-launch in a slimmed-down form. About 2,500 workers lost their jobs in the shutdown. The government has not given a reopening date.

Greece is struggling to shore up its finances and meet the terms of an international bailout.

**谷歌警告伊朗黑客攻击企图**

谷歌负责安全工程的副总裁埃里克.格罗斯发表声明说，黑客袭击的时机和目标显示这次活动是出于政治动机。他对此没有详细说明，但是他警告说，黑客企图诱骗接到其电子邮件的人点击一个链接， 这个链接使他们进入一个虚假的谷歌帐户维修网页。黑客企图以这种办法来窃取用户名称和密码。

谷歌建议用户以“两步验证服务”来加强其账户安全。所谓“两步验证服务”要求用户进入账户时除了密码以外还要提供相关信息。谷歌还提醒用户在提供敏感讯息之前要确定有关网络地址是正规的。

谷歌没有说最近袭击的幕后黑手是谁，但是暗示，他们可能就是2011年大规模袭击谷歌电邮的人。伊朗这个星期五举行总统选举。

**Google Warns of Increased Hacking Attempts in Iran**

Google is reporting a significant increase in the number of email-based hacking attempts originating from Iran in the lead-up to the country's presidential election Friday.
In a statement, the U.S. Internet company said it has disrupted and detected multiple so-called "phishing" campaigns aimed at compromising the accounts of tens of thousands of Iranian users during a period of almost three weeks.

The statement by Eric Grosse, Google's Vice President for Security Engineering, said the timing and targeting of the campaigns suggest the attacks are politically motivated. He did not elaborate.The statement warned that the email messages were meant to trick recipients into clicking on a link that would lead them to a fake Google account maintenance page that would attempt to steal user names and passwords.

It recommended users make their accounts more secure by enabling two-step verification, which requires information other than a password to access an account. It also said users should make sure that website addresses are legitimate before providing sensitive information.

Google did not say who was responsible for the hacking attempts, but suggested it could be the same group that was behind a more complicated Gmail hacking campaign in 2011.
