山口那津男早些时候表示，希望这次访问有助于日中关系趋于正常，并促使两国举行一次峰会。

**Japanese Lawmaker in China for Talks on Island Dispute**


A Japanese ruling party envoy is in China for talks aimed at reducing tensions over a bitter territorial dispute.

Natsuo Yamaguchi arrived Tuesday in Beijing, where he is delivering a letter from Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Yamaguchi hopes to meet with new Chinese leader Xi Jinping and other senior leaders during his four-day visit.

Earlier, he expressed hopes the visit would help normalize relations and lead to a bilateral summit.

Yamaguchi is the first Japanese lawmaker to visit China since the hawkish government of Mr. Abe came to power in December.

Both sides have given recent indications they are ready to de-escalate the dispute over the uninhabited islands in the East China Sea.
**外交官：美中两国就加紧制裁朝鲜达成协议**

联合国的外交官说，美国已经与中国达成一项协议，针对平壤去年12月发射火箭的举动，加强对朝鲜的国际制裁。

联合国外交官说，美国向联合国安理会15个成员国散发了一项决议草案。联合国安理会可能最早于星期二就惩罚朝鲜发射火箭的决议案进行表决。

外交官们说，这项决议案谴责朝鲜发射火箭，并将扩大目前的制裁。但目前还不清楚能否对朝鲜实行新制裁，平壤唯一的重要盟友中国一直不愿接受。

在朝鲜发射火箭后，华盛顿一直敦促北京同意对朝鲜采取强硬手段。有关方面广泛认为朝鲜以发射火箭作为伪装来试射导弹，而此举违反了联合国的制裁禁令。

** US, China Reach Deal on Tightening UN Sanctions on North Korea: Diplomats**

Diplomats at the United Nations say the United States has reached a deal with China on tightening international sanctions against North Korea for its December rocket launch.

The diplomats say the U.S. circulated a draft resolution to the 15-member U.N. Security Council. It could vote as early as Tuesday to punish North Korea for the launch.

They say the resolution would condemn the launch and expand existing sanctions. But it is not clear if it would add any new sanctions - a step that China, Pyongyang's only major ally, has been reluctant to accept.

Washington has been pushing Beijing to accept strong measures following the rocket launch, which was widely condemned as a disguised missile test banned under U.N. sanctions.
