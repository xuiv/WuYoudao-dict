**人权观察指责缅甸的种族清洗行为**

一个主要人权组织指责缅甸的战争罪行和种族清洗，并列举了乱葬岗和驱离居民的证据。

总部设在纽约的人权观察星期一发表了156页的报告，指责缅甸当局和佛教僧侣计划针对本国罗兴亚族穆斯林少数群体进行有组织的种族清洗。数百人被杀害，12万5千多人被迫离开家园。

人权观测的报告说，缅甸政府、地方官员、陆军、海军和警察去年10月鼓励缅甸西部的阿拉坎族居民对邻近的穆斯林社区和村庄进行有组织的袭击，使其感到恐惧，并迫使他们迁移。

人权观察敦促缅甸准许独立的国际委员会调查反人类罪行，并提出解决办法。人权观察还敦促为缅甸提供援助的国家要求缅甸政府立即停止侵权行为，并努力让流离失所的穆斯林安全返回家园。

美联社援引缅甸政府一名发言人的话说，人权观察调查人员“不理解当地的局势”，并拒绝接受针对缅甸安全部队的指称。这位发言人说，政府军奉命前往有关地区遏制动乱。他表示，这种动乱阻碍了民主进程。

**HRW Accuses Burma of Ethnic Cleansing**
A leading international rights group has accused Burma of war crimes and ethnic cleansing, citing evidence of mass graves and forced displacement.

New York-based Human Rights Watch released a 156-page report Monday accusing authorities and even Buddhist monks of planning an organized campaign of ethnic cleansing against the country's Rohingya Muslim minority. Hundreds of people have been killed and more than 125,000 others have been forced from their homes.

The report said the Burmese government, local officials, the army, navy and police encouraged ethnic Arakanese in western Burma to conduct coordinated attacks on Muslim neighborhoods and villages in October to terrorize and forcibly relocate the population.

HRW called on Burma to accept an independent international commission to investigate crimes against humanity and provide redress. The group also urged Burma's donors to demand that the government urgently stop abuses and promote the safe return of displaced Muslims.

The Associated Press quotes a Burmese government spokesman as saying HRW investigators do not "understand the situation on the ground,' rejecting the allegations against the security forces. He says government forces were sent to the area to stop the unrest that he says stalls "the democratic process."
