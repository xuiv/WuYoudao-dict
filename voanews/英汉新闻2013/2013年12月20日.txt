**欧盟继续呼吁乌克兰进行合作**

欧洲联盟领导人在布鲁塞尔连续第二天召开会议，再次要求乌克兰签署一项跟欧盟建立更密切关系的协议，尽管乌克兰政府努力加强与俄罗斯的关系。

立陶宛总统达利娅·格里包斯凯特星期五说：“欧盟对乌克兰人民敞开大门，但不一定对该国政府这样。”立陶宛目前是欧盟轮值主席。

亲欧盟的示威行动继续在基辅及其他乌克兰城市举行，抗议民众要求亚努科维奇下台。乌克兰总统亚努科维奇星期四严厉指责西方国家支持这些抗议示威。亚努科维奇宣布计划部分加入由莫斯科主导的经济联盟，此举可能加剧乌克兰的政治危机。

亚努科维奇在电视上接受一些他亲手挑选的记者采访时，批评外国插手乌克兰内部事务。他说，他“坚决反对别人到我们国家来教我们如何生活”。他排除了提前举行选举的可能性。


EU Continues Calls for Ukraine Cooperation


European Union leaders are opening a second day of meetings in Brussels with renewed calls for Ukraine to sign a deal establishing closer ties with the EU, despite the Ukrainian government's efforts to strengthen the relationship with Russia instead.

President Dalia Grybauskaite of Lithuania, which currently holds the EU's rotating presidency, said Friday that "Europe is open for Ukrainian people, but not necessarily for this government."

While pro-EU demonstrations continue in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, President Viktor Yanukovych on Thursday harshly criticized the West for supporting the protests, which are calling for his ouster. He announced plans to partially join a Moscow-led economic union - a move likely to deepen the country's political crisis.

Speaking in a televised interview with some hand-picked journalists, Mr. Yanukovych criticized foreign nations for meddling in Ukraine's internal affairs. The president said he is ((- in his words - )) "categorically against others coming to our country and teaching us how to live." He ruled out early elections.

Officials Investigate London Theater Collapse

Investigators in London are trying to figure out why part of the ceiling of a theater collapsed mid-performance Thursday, injuring at least 88 people at a nearly sold-out show.

Officials say it is not clear whether a downpour of rain just prior to the incident had contributed to the collapse. Police said there was no indication the collapse was the result of any deliberate act or attack.

London police told VOA there were 81 so-called "walking wounded" and that seven others were taken to the hospital following the incident at the Apollo Theater. No fatalities have been reported.

Rescue workers at the scene said all those trapped by the collapse in the century-old, 775-seat auditorium have been freed.
