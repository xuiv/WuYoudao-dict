**日本拟加强军力应对中国**

日本将建立一支新的两栖部队，并部署侦察机，作为应对中国不断增强军力的新防务计划的组成部分。

这些计划被纳入星期三公布的新安全战略及防务指针草案。日本内阁将于下星期批准这些计划。

日本首相安倍晋三说，就帮助确定日本国家安全的方向而言，新防务计划将是“历史性”的。

新安全战略及防务指针草案警告说，中国试图以武力改变地区现状。草案特别提到北京新设立的东海防空识别区，该防空区涵盖日本也宣称拥有主权的岛屿。

为加强该地区的防务，新安全战略及防务指针草案拟在南部冲绳岛的那霸空军基地建立一支两栖部队，并建议在该基地部署侦察机和早期预警飞机。

**Japan to Beef Up Military in Response to China**

Japan will set up a new amphibious military unit and deploy surveillance drones as part of its new defense plan in response to China's growing military power.

The proposals were included in drafts of new security strategy and defense guidelines released Wednesday. They are set to be approved by the Cabinet next week.

Japan's Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe said the new plans will be "historic" in helping shape the country's national security direction.

The drafts warn of what is called China's attempts to change the regional status quo by force. They specifically mention Beijing's new air defense zone in the East China Sea, which includes islands also claimed by Japan.

To help defend the area, the plan calls for the creation of amphibious forces at Naha Air Base on the southern island of Okinawa. It also proposes introducing surveillance drones and early-warning aircraft at the base.

**Ukrainian Police, Protesters Clash at Kyiv City Hall**

Ukrainian police have clashed with anti-government protesters at Kyiv's city hall in an effort to drive the activists from the building.

Reports from the Ukrainian capital say the protesters fought back by spraying water from fire hoses at the baton-wielding police.

The clash came just hours after hundreds of Ukrainian police began storming a protest encampment in central Kyiv early Wednesday, clashing with the demonstrators and ripping down their makeshift tent city.

The U.S. State Department issued a statement expressing "disgust" with the actions of Ukrainian authorities for introducing bulldozers and riot police armed with batons to the scene, rather than, in the words of Secretary of State John Kerry, "respect for democratic rights and human dignity."

On Tuesday, European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland met in the capital with senior government and opposition leaders in a push to ease the crisis.
