**埃及警察强攻抗议者营地，伤亡严重**

埃及安全部队动用装甲车，推土机，催泪弹对开罗穆尔西支持者的两个抗议者营地进行清理之后死伤人数不断加大。

与此同时，埃及临时总统星期三宣布国家进入为期一个月的紧急状态，并下令武装部队协助内务部加强治安。政府还宣布在开罗和其他几个省份实行宵禁。

有关死伤数字，各方说法出入很大。 联合国说，看来有数百人在安全部队和抗议者的冲突中被打死打伤。

穆斯林兄弟会称清场行动是“屠杀”，并说有五百人死亡。埃及卫生部说，至少有95人死亡，874人受伤。

目击者和外国记者报告说，安全部队使用了自动步枪等真枪实弹，而军方公布的照片显示，穆尔西的支持者对安全部队使用武器。埃及内务部说，部队只动用了催泪弹，营地内有人向部队开枪。
冲突中有几十人被逮捕，包括穆斯林兄弟会的领袖。

随着伊斯兰主义者愤怒情绪的蔓延，开罗其他地方和埃及的一些省份星期三也发生了冲突。 警察局，政府建筑和基督教堂被袭击，或被放火焚烧。

Heavy Casualties in Egypt as Police Storm Camps

Casualties are rising in Egypt after security forces moved in with armored vehicles, bulldozers and tear gas to clear two protest camps in Cairo set up by supporters of ousted president Mohamed Morsi.

Amid the bloodshed, Egypt's interim presidency Wednesday announced a one-month state of emergency had begun and ordered the armed forces to help the Interior Ministry enforce security. In addition, a nighttime curfew was declared in Cairo and a number of other provinces.

There are widely divergent estimates of the death toll from the clashes.

The United Nations said it appears hundreds were killed or wounded in the clashes between security forces and demonstrators demanding Mr. Morsi's reinstatement. The Muslim Brotherhood called the security operation a "massacre" and put the death toll at 500, while Egypt's Health Ministry said at least 95 people were killed and 874 wounded.

Witnesses and foreign journalists reported that security forces used live fire from automatic rifles, while the army released photos of pro-Morsi supporters using weapons against riot police. The Interior Ministry said its forces used only tear gas and that they came under fire from the camps.

Scores of people were arrested, including Brotherhood leaders.

Clashes also broke out elsewhere in the capital and other provinces across the country as Islamist anger over the crackdown spread, with police stations, government buildings and Coptic Christian churches attacked or set ablaze.

**埃及镇压招致谴责 国际社会呼吁克制**

埃及政府对前总统穆尔西的支持者进行镇压，造成多人死伤之后，支持穆尔西的穆斯林国家纷纷对埃及进行谴责。

欧洲国家敦促军队支持下的埃及临时政府和伊斯兰主义反对派避免暴力升级，并恢复政治对话。

土耳其总理埃尔多安指责埃及安全部队星期三对穆尔西支持者的镇压是“屠杀”。他敦促联合安理会和阿拉伯联盟立即采取行动制止。土耳其总统古尔指责说，埃及政府对平民进行暴力干预是不能接受的。

埃及当局说，有些抗议者携带武器，并且向安全部队开枪。

埃及军方七月3号在埃及首位民选领导人穆尔西任职一年之后罢免了他的总统职务。在国际上，土耳其是这一决定的最强烈的批评者之一。

埃及军方说，他们是在对人民的意愿做出反应。之前世俗的埃及人举行大规模抗议活动， 指责穆尔西反民主。

联合国秘书长潘基文的发言人说，潘基文以最强硬的方式谴责埃及的暴力。他对埃及当局选择用武力对付伊斯兰主义示威活动感到遗憾。 不过这位发言人还说， 联合国秘书长也知道大多数埃及人厌倦了示威和反示威给民众正常生活造成的影响。 他们希望自己的国家在埃及人主导的进程中和平地向前迈进。

Egypt Crackdown Draws Condemnation, Appeals for Restraint

The Egyptian government's deadly crackdown on supporters of former Islamist President Mohamed Morsi has drawn condemnation from leaders of Muslim nations who backed the ousted leader.

European powers urged the military-backed interim government and its Islamist opponents to avoid an escalation of violence and return to a political dialogue.

Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan described Wednesday's crackdown by Egyptian security forces on pro-Morsi protest camps in Cairo as a "massacre." He urged the U.N. Security Council and the Arab League to act immediately to stop it.

Turkish President Abdullah Gul accused the Egyptian government of staging an armed intervention against civilians and called that "unacceptable." Egyptian authorities said some of the protesters were armed and fired at security forces.

Ankara was one of the strongest international critics of the Egyptian military's decision to oust Morsi on July 3, one year after he took office as Egypt's first democratically elected leader.

The military said it acted in response to what it called the will of the people after mass protests by secular Egyptians who accused Mr. Morsi of being anti-democratic.

A spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the U.N. chief condemns the violence in Egypt in the strongest terms, and regrets that Egyptian authorities chose to use force against the mostly Islamist demonstrations.

However, the spokesman also said the U.N. chief also is "well aware that the vast majority of the Egyptian people [are] weary of disruptions to normal life caused by demonstrations and counter-demonstrations, and want their country to go forward peacefully in an Egyptian-led process."
