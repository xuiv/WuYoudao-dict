China Indicts Anti-Corruption Campaigner

Chinese prosecutors have indicted a prominent activist who founded a group that works within the system to promote political change.

The lawyer for Xu Zhiyong said Friday that prosecutors had formally charged his client with "disturbing public order," a common charge against rights activists who attempt any form of protest.

Xu founded the New Citizens Movement, a loose network of activists who have held small street rallies to urge officials to disclose their asset and called on citizens to fight corruption.

Xu was arrested in late August in a wide-ranging crackdown on peaceful dissent.

**据报在伊朗失踪的美国人是为中情局工作**

两家美国媒体报道说，将近七年前在伊朗境内神秘失踪的一名美国男子是为美国中央情报局执行任务。

美联社和华盛顿邮报说，罗伯特•莱文森为一组中情局分析员搜集情报，而这些分析员没有得到执行国外任务的授权。

前美国联邦调查局特工莱文森于2007年3月失踪，当时他在伊朗的基什岛。莱文森的家人和美国政府官员说，他是因私人业务去基什岛的。

但星期四的报道说，莱文森实际上是去基什岛与达乌德•萨拉胡丁会面。萨拉胡丁由于1980年参与在美国谋杀一名伊朗外交官而受到通缉，他与伊朗领导人关系密切。

报道说，莱文森的律师在电邮中发现，一名中情局分析员在莱文森前往基什岛之前向他保证，他此行的费用可以报销。

American Who Disappeared in Iran Worked for CIA: Reports

Two U.S. media outlets are reporting that an American man who mysteriously disappeared nearly seven years ago in Iran was conducting a rogue operation for the CIA.

The Associated Press and Washington Post say Robert Levinson was gathering intelligence for a group of CIA analysts who did not have authority to run overseas operations.

The ex-FBI agent disappeared in March 2007 while visiting the Iranian island of Kish, on what his family and U.S. government officials have described as a private business trip.

But the reports Thursday said Levinson was actually meeting with Dawud Salahuddin, who is wanted for the murder of an Iranian diplomat in the U.S. in 1980 and has close ties to Iranian leaders.

The reports say Levinson's lawyers discovered emails in which a CIA analyst assured Levinson before the trip that he would be reimbursed for his expenses.
