**N Korean Kim: War Could Occur 'Without Any Prior Notice'**

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has instructed his military to boost its combat readiness, warning a war could break out "without any prior notice."

The state-run Korean Central News Agency reported Wednesday that Mr. Kim made the comments during a visit to a combat unit on Tuesday.

The move comes as North Korea's neighbors watch the communist country for signs of instability, following a shocking purge of senior leadership in Pyongyang.

Mr. Kim's uncle, Jang Song Thaek, thought to be his mentor and second in command, was executed earlier this month after being accused of trying to overthrow the state.

Tuesday, South Korean President Park Geun-hye made her own trip to a frontline guard post, telling troops Seoul would respond "mercilessly to any provocations."
