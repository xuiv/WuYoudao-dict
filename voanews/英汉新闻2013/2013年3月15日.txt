**中国任命李克强当总理**

中国全国人大选举李克强为总理，中国共产党十年一度的权力交接程序进入最后阶段。

正如人们预料的那样，中国全国人大星期五几乎以全票选举李克强接替温家宝的总理职位。现年57岁的李克强将掌管中国经济以及政府的日常领导工作。

中国全国人大认可中共的决定，一天前任命习近平为国家主席，习近平接掌权力的程序就此完成。

习近平和李克强在去年11月的中共代表大会上获取高位后，誓言促进经济增长、减少污染以及打击广泛存在的腐败现象。预计习近平和李克强将在未来10年中保持现在的地位。

China Names Li Keqiang as Premier

China's parliament has elected Li Keqiang as premier, as the country's Communist Party nears the final stages of its once-a-decade transition of power.

As expected, the National People's Congress on Friday nearly unanimously selected the English-speaking Mr. Li to replace Wen Jiabao. The 57-year-old will be in charge of running China's economy and day-to-day leadership of the government.

The parliament, which reflexively endorses the decisions of the Communist Party, named Xi Jinping as president a day earlier, in a formality that completes his rise to China's top leadership position.

Since attaining the top spots in the party at a congress in November, the two men have vowed to revamp China's economy, reduce pollution and crack down on widespread corruption. They are expected to serve in their positions for the next 10 years.


**朝鲜指责美国发动网络攻击**

朝鲜指责美国对其发动网络攻击，此前平壤政府控制的几个网站本星期看来出现停运现象。

朝鲜官方的朝中社星期五指责美国及其盟友近日来进行“密集而持续”的网络攻击。

互联网用户说，包括朝中社在内的几个政府控制的网站本星期不同寻常地长时间不能登陆。美国没有对朝鲜方面的指责做出回应。

朝鲜的有关文章几乎没有提供任何细节，但试图将据称的网络攻击同美韩两国本星期早些时候开始的联合模拟战演习联系起来。这一演习是依靠电脑进行的。

朝鲜上星期威胁说，如果美国与韩国进行年度军事演习，朝鲜就将对美国发动先发制人的核打击。美韩联合军演于星期一正常启动。

N.Korea Accuses US of Launching Cyber Attacks

North Korea is accusing the United States of launching cyber attacks against it, after several of Pyongyang's state-controlled websites suffered apparent outages this week.

The official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on Friday blamed the U.S. and its allies for what it called "concentrated and persistent virus attacks" over the past several days.

Internet users say several state-controlled websites, including KCNA, have been inaccessible for unusually prolonged periods this week. The U.S. has not responded to the accusation.

The North Korean article offered few details, but attempted to link the alleged cyber attack to a computer-based joint U.S.-South Korean war simulation that began earlier this week.

Last week, North Korea threatened to wage a "preemptive nuclear attack" on the U.S. if it went ahead with the annual exercise, which proceeded as normal on Monday.
