**巴拿马：放行朝鲜货船，船员命运待定**

一名巴拿马检察官说，因被指私运古巴军火而被扣留的一艘朝鲜货船可以离开巴拿马，但表示尚未决定如何处置35名船员。早些时候媒体对此有过不同的报道。

检察官穆尔加斯星期三晚间对记者说，他的办公室收到一系列有关如何处置朝鲜船只上的船员的诉求，但目前尚未做出决定。

穆尔加斯说，这艘朝鲜船只可以离开，但可能必须首先向巴拿马运河管理局缴纳罚款，然后才能离境。

穆尔加斯星期三早些时候曾表示，只有这艘船的船长、大副和船上一名朝鲜官员将被指控私运军火。

Panama: North Korea Ship Can Leave, But Status of Crew Uncertain


A Panamanian prosecutor says a North Korean ship detained for allegedly smuggling Cuban weapons is free to go, but says no decision has been made about the 35 crew members, contrary to earlier reports.

Prosecutor Nahaniel Murgas told reporters late Wednesday that his office has an application requesting a series of measures in regard to the crew members, but no decisions yet.

Murgas said the North Korean vessel is free to go, but may not leave the country without paying penalty fines owed to the Panama Canal Authority.

Earlier Wednesday Murgas had said only the ship's captain, first mate, and a Korean official on board, would be held to face charges of arms trafficking.

**泰国总理英拉保住职位**

泰国总理英拉轻松通过了议会的不信任投票，她的政党控制着议会多数席位。

星期四在曼谷举行的表决中，泰国议会以297票对134票否决了根据腐败指称罢免英拉总理职务的动议。

与此同时，泰国反对派星期三扩大了示威活动的规模，并誓言要占领所有政府部级机构，直至英拉总理辞职。

抗议者已经占领了财政部和外交部的部分办公区，并包围了内政部大楼。

英拉拒绝辞职，并呼吁以对话方式解决分歧。她誓言不以武力手段制止抗议活动。

这是自2010年以来最大规模的街头抗议。2010年，反对派抗议遭到军队镇压，造成90多人死亡。

几星期前，一项特赦法案允许英拉的哥哥、前总理他信回国，并免除他因腐败罪被判处的两年刑期。这项法案引发了抗议活动。泰国参议院否决了这项法案，但反对派领导的抗议活动仍在继续。

英拉于2011年出任泰国总理。2006年的街头抗议导致他信下台，他被判定犯有腐败罪。他信随后流亡国外，以避免服刑。他表示，对他的控告是出于政治动机。

Thai PM Survives No-confidence Vote

Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra has easily survived a no-confidence vote in parliament, where her party controls the majority of seats.

Lawmakers in Bangkok voted 297 to 134 Thursday against a measure that would have unseated her because of allegations of corruption.

Meanwhile, opposition protesters expanded their demonstrations across the capital Wednesday, vowing to take over every government ministry until Prime Minister Yingluck resigns.

The protesters have already taken over parts of the finance and foreign ministries and surrounded the interior ministry.

Prime Minister Yingluck has refused to step down and has called for dialogue to resolve the situation. She has vowed not to use violence to stop the protests.

The street protests are the largest in Thailand since 2010, when more than 90 people were killed in a military crackdown on an opposition protest.

The latest protests were triggered several weeks ago by an amnesty bill that would have allowed former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, Mrs. Yingluck's brother, to return home and avoid a two-year jail term for corruption. That amnesty bill was rejected by the Senate, but opposition-led protests have continued.

Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra came to power in 2011. Thaksin, was toppled by street protests in 2006 and convicted of corruption. He has lived in exile to escape the charges, which he says were politically motivated.
