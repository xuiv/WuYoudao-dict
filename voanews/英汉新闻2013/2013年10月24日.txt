**巴基斯坦的谢里夫和奥巴马讨论改善双边关系**

巴基斯坦总理谢里夫要求美国总统奥巴马停止在巴基斯坦的无人飞机空袭。无人机空袭在巴基斯坦非常不得人心。

谢里夫星期三结束在白宫的会谈之后说，他强调了“结束这类空袭的必要性”。奥巴马在对记者讲话中没有提及无人机空袭。

但华盛顿邮报星期四报道，巴基斯坦高层官员秘密支持美国的无人机空袭计划。报道说，该报获得的美国中央情报局高度机密文件以及巴基斯坦外交备忘录显示，伊斯兰堡收到了有关无人机空袭以及伤亡情况的秘密介绍。

奥巴马赞扬巴基斯坦向恐怖主义所作的斗争。他说，在过去10年里，4万多名巴基斯坦人死于极端分子的袭击。奥巴马说，他了解谢里夫一心致力于制止巴基斯坦的恐怖主义活动，并防止恐怖主义向境外蔓延。

两位领导人发表的联合声明说，他们的伙伴关系“建立在尊重主权和领土完整的原则基础之上”。

奥巴马还表示，他试图让谢里夫对阿富汗的状况感到安心。美国作战部队计划明年撤离阿富汗。奥巴马说，他相信这一方案不但“对阿富汗有利”，也有助于长期保护巴基斯坦。

Pakistan's Sharif and Obama Talk of Improved Ties

Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has asked U.S. President Barack Obama to end drone strikes on his country, strikes that are widely unpopular in Pakistan.

Following talks Wednesday at the White House, Mr. Sharif said he emphasized "the need for an end to such strikes." Mr. Obama did not mention drones in his remarks to reporters.

But in a published report Thursday, The Washington Post says top officials in Pakistan's government have secretly endorsed the U.S. drone program. The newspaper says top-secret CIA documents and Pakistani diplomatic memos it has obtained shows Islamabad received classified briefings on strikes and casualty counts.

Mr. Obama cited Pakistan's battle with terrorism, saying more than 40,000 Pakistanis have died in extremist attacks during the past decade. He said he knows Mr. Sharif is very much committed to try to reduce terrorism in Pakistan and prevent it from being exported.

A joint statement from the two leaders said their partnership is "based on the principles of respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity."

Mr. Obama also said he tried to reassure Mr. Sharif about the status of Afghanistan, where U.S. combat forces plan to withdraw next year. He said he is "confident" of a solution "that is good for Afghanistan, but also helps to protect Pakistan over the long term."

Military Drill Sparked Massive Australian Wildfire: Investigators

Australian officials say a routine military drill is responsible for sparking one of the largest of the dozens of fires that have ravaged the country's most populous state.

Investigators say an explosion during a live-fire military exercise ignited bushland near the city of Lithgow, west of Sydney. The blaze has burned 47,000 hectares of land and destroyed several houses.

Mark Greenhill, the mayor of the nearby town of Blue Mountains, said he hopes to see a transparent investigation.

Though the danger has eased somewhat with the onset of cooler weather, more than 60 fires are still burning in New South Wales state, with many still raging out of control. Since late last week, the fires have destroyed over 200 homes and led to the death of one person.
