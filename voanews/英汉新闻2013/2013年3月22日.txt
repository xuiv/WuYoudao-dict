**奥巴马结束对以色列和约旦河西岸的访问**

美国总统奥巴马即将结束对以色列和约旦河西岸的访问，他在访问期间与以色列和巴勒斯坦领导人举行了会谈，并敦促以巴双方恢复和平努力。

奥巴马星期五在参观以色列的大屠杀纪念馆时发表讲话，呼吁人们相互容忍。

奥巴马在前往约旦之前将和以色列总理内塔尼亚胡再次会晤。他们俩人可能讨论奥巴马星期四在耶路撒冷发表的讲演。奥巴马在讲演中说，同巴勒斯坦实现和平是“实现真正安全的唯一途径”。

奥巴马说，以色列领导人必须理解，继续在巴勒斯坦人宣称建国的土地上兴建定居点会起到“反作用”。奥巴马还表示，他相信巴勒斯坦权力机构主席阿巴斯是以色列的真正和平伙伴。

** Obama Winds Down Visit to Israel, West Bank**

U.S. President Barack Obama is winding down a visit to Israel and the West Bank that has included talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders and calls for the two sides to resume peace efforts.

Mr. Obama on Friday called for tolerance against others in a visit to Israel's Holocaust memorial.

Mr. Obama and Mr. Netanyahu are expected to have one more meeting before Mr. Obama departs for Jordan. The two men are likely to discuss Mr. Obama's Thursday speech in Jerusalem, where he said peace with the Palestinians is the "only path to true security."

Mr. Obama said Israeli leaders must recognize that "continued settlement activity" on land the Palestinians claim for a state is "counterproductive." Mr. Obama also said he believes Israel has a genuine peace partner in Palestinian President Abbas.

**缅甸佛教徒与穆斯林再起冲突 至少20人丧生**

缅甸中部地区佛教徒和穆斯林接连第三天发生致命暴力冲突，一个主要人权组织警告说，种族间的紧张局势正在蔓延。

目击者说，星期五街道上有烧焦的尸体，并说几个建筑仍在冒出火苗，包括密铁拉镇的几座清真寺。

当地立法官员说，至少20人在冲突中被打死。星期三，一家金店的一名顾客与穆斯林店主发生争执，随后引发了冲突。

有关当局已经实行了宵禁。很多居民说，他们不敢离家外出，密铁拉镇上基本没有行人，街头上只有愤怒的暴民在游荡。

美国和联合国敦促停止这场暴力。自去年缅甸西部若开邦的佛教徒和罗兴亚族穆斯林爆发冲突后，这是缅甸最严重的教派骚乱。

**Renewed Buddhist-Muslim Clashes in Burma At Least 20 Dead**

A third day of deadly Buddhist-Muslim violence has broken out in central Burma, as a leading rights group warned of spreading ethnic tension.

Witnesses reported charred bodies lying in the streets Friday, and say flames continue to pour from several buildings, including mosques, in the town of Meikhtila.

Local lawmakers say at least 20 people have been killed in the clashes, which began Wednesday following an argument between a customer and the Muslim owner of a gold shop.

Authorities have imposed a nighttime curfew and many residents say they are afraid to leave their homes, leaving the city largely deserted except for angry mobs roaming the streets.

The United States and United Nations have called for an end to the violence, Burma's worst sectarian unrest since last year's clashes between Buddhists and ethnic Rohingya Muslims in western Rakhine state.
