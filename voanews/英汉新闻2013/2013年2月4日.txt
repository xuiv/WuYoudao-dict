**美韩两国开始海军演习**

韩国和美国在朝鲜半岛东部海域开始进行一次联合海军演习，以检验这两个盟国的战备状况。

官员说，这次为期三天的演习于星期一在蒲项市附近的东海海域展开。演习内容包括作战行动训练、侦测和追踪潜艇、防空、反舰实弹训练以及反导弹训练。

韩国海军部署了10艘舰只，美国海军则出动了“圣弗兰西斯科号”核潜艇和“希洛号”导弹巡洋舰。

在美韩举行这次海军演习之际，朝鲜每日加紧进行核试验威胁，作为对联合国因其去年12月发射远程火箭而扩大制裁的反应。

**US, South Korea Begin Naval Exercises**

South Korea and the United States have launched a joint naval exercise off the east coast of the Korean peninsula to test the combat readiness of the two allies.

Officials say the three-day drill began Monday in the East Sea near the city of Pohang. The exercise includes operating training, detecting and tracking a submarine, anti-air and anti-ship live fire training and anti-missile training.

The South Korean Navy deployed 10 vessels, while the U.S. Navy has the nuclear submarine USS San Francisco and the guided missile cruiser USS Shiloh in the maneuvers.

The drill comes as North Korea has ramped up daily threats of a nuclear test in response to expand UN sanctions imposed after its long-range rocket launch in December.

**一名挨打的埃及男子承认遭到警察殴打**

上星期在埃及反政府抗议活动遭到剥光衣服殴打的一名埃及男子已经承认，警察要对这次事件负责。当时的情形被拍下照片，激起全国民众的愤怒。

早些时候，现年48岁的萨布尔指责抗议者上星期五在总统府外面殴打他，当时抗议者聚集在那里，抗议穆尔西总统的由伊斯兰主义者领导的政府。

但萨布尔星期天接受埃及一家电视台采访时改变了说法，他承认殴打自己的是防暴警察。埃及电视台对这一事件做了实况报道，并清楚地展示了戴头盔的警察殴打这名男子，并把赤身裸体的他在地上拖着走。

穆尔西的办公室说，这段录像“令人震惊”，负责警方事务的埃及内政部则下令对这起事件进行罕见的调查。

** Egyptian Beating Victim Admits Police Assaulted Him**

An Egyptian man who was stripped naked and beaten at an anti-government protest in Cairo last week has acknowledged that police were responsible for the assault, which was caught on camera and triggered national outrage.

Forty-eight-year-old Hamada Saber earlier had accused fellow protesters of beating him last Friday outside the presidential palace, where they had gathered to denounce the Islamist-led government of President Mohamed Morsi.

But, in an interview with an Egyptian television network on Sunday, Saber changed his story, admitting that riot police were to blame. The incident was broadcast live on Egyptian television and clearly showed helmeted police beating the man and dragging him naked across the ground.

Mr. Morsi's office called the video "shocking," and the Egyptian interior ministry, which oversees the police, ordered a rare investigation.
