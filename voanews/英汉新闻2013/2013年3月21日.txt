**韩国：电脑网络攻击来自中国境内的网址**

韩国官员说，造成韩国几家主要银行和电视台电脑系统瘫痪的网络攻击来自中国。

韩国通讯委员会星期四说，初步调查结果显示，一个中国的IP网址生成的病毒代码侵袭了韩国一家银行的服务器。

但韩国通讯委员会强调说，目前还不能确定这次网络攻击的策划者，并表示这次网络攻击可能是从另一个国家发动，同时使其看上去是源自中国。

韩国国防部发言人暗示，发动这次网络攻击的是朝鲜，据信朝鲜曾通过中国境内的网址对首尔进行网络攻击。

韩联社还援引韩国总统办公室一名没有透露姓名的高层官员的话说，首尔强烈怀疑朝鲜发动了这次网络攻击。

发生在星期三的这次网络攻击造成韩国 YTN、MBC和KBS等三家电视台以及新韩和农协等两家银行的电脑网络瘫痪。

**South Korea: Chinese Address Source of Cyber Attack **

South Korean officials say a cyber attack that shut down computers at several of the country's top banks and TV broadcasters originated in China.

The Korea Communications Commission on Thursday said an initial investigation revealed that a Chinese IP address created the malicious code in a server of one of the affected banks.

But the commission stressed that this does not confirm who was behind the attack, saying it could have been launched in another country and made to appear to come from China.

South Korean Defense Ministry spokesperson suggested the culprit is North Korea, which in the past is believed to re-route cyberattacks on Seoul through Chinese addresses.

South Korea's Yonhap news agency also quoted an unidentified high-ranking official in the presidential office as saying that Seoul bears a "strong suspicion" that North Korea conducted the attack.

The attack Wednesday paralyzed computers at television broadcasters YTN, MBC, and KBS, as well as two commercial banks, Shinhan Bank and Nonghyup Bank.

**塞浦路斯寻求应对债务危机新方案**

塞浦路斯官员星期三全天进行磋商，争取制定一项筹措资金方案，以避免这个地中海岛国出现债务违约。

国际借贷方要求塞浦路斯首先筹集75亿美元，然后才能批准为塞浦路斯提供130亿美元救助金，但塞浦路斯领导人并没有明确的手段来满足这一要求。塞浦路斯议会星期二以压倒多数否决对银行存款征税，征收存款税使储户感到愤怒。

塞浦路斯政府说，国内各银行在下星期二之前仍将停止营业，以避免出现挤兑。塞浦路斯各家银行已经停止营业一周。

欧洲向塞浦路斯施加压力，要求该国在议会否决征收存款税之后拿出应对这个岛国债务危机的新方案。

**Cyprus Looks for a New Debt Plan**

Officials in Cyprus met throughout the day Wednesday to try to craft a new funding plan to avoid a debt default for the Mediterranean island nation.

Cypriot leaders were faced with no obvious way to raise $7.5 billion the country's international lenders are demanding before they will approve $13 billion in rescue funds. On Tuesday, the country's parliament overwhelmingly rejected a tax on bank deposits that angered savers.

The Nicosia government said the country's banks, closed all week, would remain shut until next Tuesday, to prevent a run on accounts.

Europe is pressuring Cyprus to offer new solutions to the island nation's debt crisis after parliament rejected the deposit tax plan.
