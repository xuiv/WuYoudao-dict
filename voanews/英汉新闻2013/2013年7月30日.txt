詹姆斯.科米是一位共和党人，他在乔治•W•布什总统任职期间担任司法部副部长。

**US Senate Approves New FBI Director**

The U.S. Senate has confirmed President Barack Obama's pick to become the next director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, James Comey.

Senators Monday overwhelmingly supported Comey with a vote of 93-1. He will replace Robert Mueller, who has led the FBI since shortly before the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks against the United States.

The vote went forward Monday after Republican Senator Rand Paul ended his delaying tactics against the nomination. Paul had been blocking the vote over concerns about the domestic use of drones. He was the only one who voted against confirmation.

Comey, a Republican, served as a deputy attorney general in the previous administration of President George W. Bush.

一名中国政府官员否认北京和东京计划就领土争端问题举行高层会谈。中日两国关系因领土争端而处于紧张状态。

这位没有透露姓名的官员对官方的中国日报说，日本方面对这种会谈的任何猜测都是“不实的，是为日本国内政治的需要而编造的”。

日本首相安倍晋三的助手饭岛勋星期天说，安倍首相可能在不久的将来与中国国家主席习近平举行一次峰会。

但中国日报星期二说，饭岛勋从未就举行会谈事宜与中国政府官员进行接触。

与此同时，日本副外相斋木昭隆即将结束对中国的两天访问。

安倍晋三曾经表示，希望就领土争端问题与中国进行高层会谈。领土争端导致中日两国关系近几个月来急剧恶化。

**China Rules Out High-Level Summit with Japan over Island Dispute**

A Chinese government official denies Beijing and Tokyo are planning high-level talks on a territorial dispute that has strained ties between the two Asian powers.

The unidentified official tells the state-run China Daily any Japanese speculation about such talks is "not true and is fabricated, based on the needs of Japan's domestic politics."

An aide to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Sunday Mr. Abe could hold a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the "not too distant future."

But the Tuesday China Daily report said the aide, Isao Iijima, has not been in contact with Chinese government officials about any such talks.
It comes as Japan's Vice Foreign Minister Akitaka Saiki wraps up a two-day visit to China.

Prime Minister Abe has also said he hopes to hold high-level talks with China over the territorial dispute, which has sent China-Japan relations plummeting in recent months.
