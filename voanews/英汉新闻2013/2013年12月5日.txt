**拜登：中国防空区令人“不安”**

美国副总统拜登说，中国新设立的东海防空识别区导致该地区的“严重不安”。

拜登星期四在北京对一些美国商界领袖说，他在与中国国家主席习近平会谈时“非常直率”地提出了东海防空识别区的问题。

但拜登表示，尽管北京和华盛顿时有分歧，双方之间的冲突并非不可避免。

拜登和习近平星期三进行了五个多小时的会谈。拜登说，他在会谈中表达了华盛顿有关东海防空区的“坚定立场和期待”。

中国外交部说，习近平向拜登指出，设立防空区符合国际法，美国对此应采取客观公正的态度。

美国拒绝承认中国上月设立的东海防空识别区。这一防空区涵盖美国盟友日本宣称拥有主权的几个岛屿。

拜登星期四将与中国总理李克强举行会谈，预计东海防空区将是主要议题。

结束对中国的访问后，拜登将前往韩国进行访问。韩国也表示对东海防空区持保留立场。首尔是拜登此次亚洲之行的最后一站。

Biden: China's Air Defense Zone Causing 'Apprehension'

U.S. Vice President Joe Biden says China's new air defense zone in the East China Sea has created "significant apprehension" in the region.

Biden told a group of U.S. business leaders in Beijing Thursday he was "very direct" about the matter during his talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

But the vice president said conflict between Beijing and Washington was not inevitable, despite sometimes having disagreements.

Biden and Mr. Xi met for about five hours Wednesday, during which the U.S. leader said he expressed Washington's "firm position and expectations" on the air defense zone.

China's foreign ministry said Mr. Xi told Biden the zone was in accordance with international law and that the U.S. should take an "objective and fair attitude" about it.

The U.S. has rejected China's Air Defense Identification Zone, or ADIZ, set up last month, which includes territory claimed by U.S. ally Japan.

The issue was expected to dominate Biden's China talks, which continued Thursday during a meeting with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.

Biden travels later in the day to South Korea, which has also rejected China's ADIZ. Seoul is the last stop on Biden's week-long Asia tour.

**泰国国王呼吁各派团结**

深受民众爱戴的泰国国王普密蓬在其生日庆典中向全国发表讲话，呼吁泰国人民为了国家而相互支持。

86岁的普密蓬国王星期四发表演讲之际，反对派暂时停止了推翻政府的努力。

普密蓬国王住院治疗四年后，于今年早些时候出院。在华欣海滨王宫，普密蓬国王以缓慢的语调发表了讲话。

出于对普密蓬国王的尊敬，反对派停止了持续一星期的抗议活动。在政治处于分裂状态的泰国，作为统一象征的普密蓬国王受到广泛尊敬。

但抗议活动领导人素贴誓言将于星期五继续进行示威，并表示要一直坚持到英拉总理辞职并把权力移交给一个不经选举产生的委员会。

Thai King Calls for Unity

Thailand's revered monarch called on the Thai people to "support each other for the sake of the country," during his annual birthday address to the nation.

King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who turns 86 Thursday, spoke as opposition protesters paused their efforts aimed at overthrowing the government.

The king, who was released from the hospital earlier this year after a four-year stay, spoke slowly as he read his address at his seaside palace in Hua Hin.

The weeks-old protests were stopped out of respect for the monarch, who is widely revered as a unifying figure in the politically polarized nation.

But protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban pledged to continue the fight Friday, vowing to not back down until Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra resigns and turns over control to an unelected council.
