Typhoon Hits China

Chinese authorities say a powerful typhoon has made landfall in the eastern province of Fujian, forcing evacuations, cutting power, destroying homes and causing the shutdown of rail and air transportation.

China's National Meteorological Center says Typhoon Fitow struck Fuding city early Monday with winds of 150 kilometers per hour, then quickly slowed before weakening to a tropical storm.

Authorities evacuated more than half a million people, while the storm dumped more than 200 millimeters of rain on the region.

Forecasters say Fitow will continue to move northwestward, but will weaken quickly.

**空中客车公司打破波音在日本的垄断**

日本航空公司说，该公司订购了31架空中客车A350宽体客机，这一交易将对美国波音公司在日本民航业的主导地位形成挑战。

日航星期一表示，该公司签署了以95亿美元购买31架空中客车A350客机的协议，并保留另行购买25架的选项。

这将是日航首次购买空中客车客机。预计这批客机将于2019年开始服役，替代老旧的波音机队。

工业专家说，由于波音推迟交付新型的787梦幻客机以及今年1月梦幻客机由于电池问题而不能起飞，人们对波音能否按时交付这种客机产生了疑问。

日航的竞争对手全日空公司也在研究以空中客车替代波音客机的可行性。

Airbus Breaks Boeing's Monopoly in Japan

Japan Airlines says it is ordering 31 Airbus A350 wide-body jets, in a deal that challenges U.S. aerospace company Boeing's dominance in the country.

JAL said Monday it had signed a $9.5 billion purchase agreement for the 31 long-haul planes with an option to buy another 25 aircraft.

The deal marks the first time JAL has bought Airbus planes. The new aircraft are expected to come into service beginning in 2019, as the carrier replaces its aging Boeing fleet.

Industry experts say delays in Boeing's deliveries of its new 787 Dreamliner and their grounding in January because of battery failures has cast doubt on Boeing's ability to deliver aircraft on time.

Rival Japanese carrier All Nippon Airways is also studying the feasibility of Airbus planes to replace its aging fleet of Boeing jets.
