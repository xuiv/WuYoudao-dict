**朝鲜更换强硬派国防部长**

朝鲜用一个鲜为人知的陆军将军张政男取代强硬派的国防部长金格植。

虽然朝鲜没有正式宣布，但是朝鲜官方的中央通讯社说，张政男陪同朝鲜领导人金正恩一同观看一个文艺演出。报道称张政男是人民武装部长。

张政男取代了强硬派的金格植。据信，金格植是2010年朝鲜炮击韩国前线岛屿延坪岛，造成4人死亡事件的幕后主导人物。

朝鲜国防部长易人，正值朝鲜半岛从因朝鲜2月进行核试验而加剧的军事紧张关系中走出来的时候。

**North Korea Changes Hard-Line Defense Chief**

North Korea has replaced its hard-line defense chief with a little-known army general.

Although no official announcement was made, a news report from the official Korean Central News Agency named Jang Jong Nam as among the party officials attending an art performance with leader Kim Jong Un. He was identified as the minister of the People's Armed Forces.

He replaces hawkish General Kim Kyok Sik, who is believed responsible for the 2010 shelling of a South Korean border island that killed four people.

The change comes as the Korean peninsula is emerging from a period of heightened military tensions that followed the North's nuclear test in February.

**菲律宾举行为阿基诺改革至关重要的选举**

菲律宾正在举行选举。这次选举被认为是对总统阿基诺改革日程的授权。

选民星期一将选举1万8千多名官员，包括地方领导人，24名参议员中过半数以上的参议员，以及数百名众议员的议员。

2010年，阿基诺承诺要打击导致普遍贫穷的腐败，因此以压倒性多数赢得总统选举的胜利。

阿基诺在惩处腐败官员方面的举措深受百姓的欢迎，被惩办的腐败官员包括他的前任阿罗约。阿罗约目前因据称大规模腐败被关押。

菲律宾的选举长期以来受到贿赂和对竞争对手的恫吓，或暴力现象的困扰。

星期一的选举结果预计将在几天后揭晓。

**Philippines Holds Elections Crucial for Aquino Reforms**

The Philippines is holding elections seen as a mandate for President Benigno Aquino's reform agenda.

Voters on Monday are choosing more than 18,000 officials, including local leaders, more than half of the 24-member Senate and hundreds of legislators in the House of Representatives.

President Aquino swept into power by a landslide in 2010 on a promise to fight corruption that he blames for widespread poverty.

He has scored high popularity ratings for prosecuting corrupt officials, including his predecessor, Gloria Arroyo, now in detention while being tried for alleged massive graft.

Elections in the Philippines have long been plagued by bribery, along with intimidation or violence against opponents.

Results of Monday's poll are expected in a few days.
