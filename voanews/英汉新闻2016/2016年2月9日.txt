Iraq Says Troops Fully Recaptured Ramadi

Iraq says its forces have completely recaptured the city of Ramadi and surrounding areas from Islamic State fighters.

The military and interior ministry said Tuesday that Iraqi troops finished retaking several areas to the east of Ramadi, and had reopened a road that links the city to Baghdad.

Islamic State took control of Ramadi last May in what was a huge blow to the government and military. After an offensive that began on the outskirts of the city, government forces pushed the militants out of the center of Ramadi in December.

Iraqi troops are still working to dismantle a large number of bombs Islamic State left planted in the city.
