Deadly Suicide Bombing Hits Police Convoy In Kabul

Taliban suicide car bombers struck a police convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, Thursday, with reports saying at least 30 security personnel were killed.

The convoy was transporting cadets and trainers when it came under attack. Afghan officials confirmed there were back-to-back blasts.

Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Seddiqi said authorities were gathering details and promised to share them soon.

Eyewitnesses told VOA they saw police personnel evacuating dead and wounded.

The Taliban claimed responsibility for the bombing. In a statement sent to reporters, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said a suicide bomber rammed his explosives-filed car into the convoy.

Mujahid added, a second bomber then struck police officers who had gathered around the site of the first blast. He claimed the attacks killed dozens of Afghan security personnel

数百名伊斯兰国战斗人员在空袭中丧生

伊拉克和美国官员星期四称，在伊拉克发动的空袭打死至少250名伊斯兰国武装人员。

空袭在费卢杰以南击中约40辆伊斯兰国组织的车辆。费卢杰曾经是伊斯兰国的据点，上个星期被美国领导的伊拉克联军解放。

这次空袭是对伊斯兰国组织造成死伤人数最多的一次攻击，但是有关官员警告说，伊斯兰国尽管失去很多地盘，但是士气似乎没有受到影响。

这个星期，叙利亚军队也从伊斯兰国组织手中夺回了伊拉克边境附近一些城市的控制权。伊斯兰国组织控制这些城市实际上打通了叙利亚和伊拉克之间的边界，称该地区为 “哈里发国”，便于运输和协调行动。

伊拉克军队在耗时一个月成功夺回了费卢杰的控制权后，正努力从伊斯兰国组织手中夺回伊拉克第二大城市摩苏尔的控制权。

Hundreds of IS Fighters Killed in Airstrikes

Airstrikes have killed at least 250 Islamic State fighters in Iraq, both Iraqi and U.S. officials reported Thursday.

The airstrikes hit around 40 Islamic State vehicles just south of Fallujah, a former Islamic State stronghold liberated by U.S.-led Iraqi coalitions last week.

These airstrikes mark the deadliest attack against the jihadist group, though officials warn their morale does not seem to be damaged, despite territorial losses.

Syrian forces have also made strides this week in regaining control of Islamic State held towns near Iraq which have effectively erased the border for jihadist fighters, making transportation and coordination easier in what Islamic State has declared its "caliphate" of the two countries.

After succeeding in their month-long coalition to seize control of Fallujah, Iraqi forces will work to retake Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, from jihadist control.
