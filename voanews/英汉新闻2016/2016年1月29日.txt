奥巴马:下任美国总统将是民主党人

美国总统奥巴马告诉民主党人说，他确信下任美国总统将是民主党人。

奥巴马星期四在美国首都华盛顿以北的巴尔的摩表示，民主党人将赢得11月的总统大选，一位民主党总统将接替他的职位，这一点毋需置疑。

奥巴马说，他之所以相信这一预言会实现，是因为民主党人把注意力集中在与美国人民生活息息相关的问题上。

奥巴马抨击共和党总统参选人川普。他说，如果容许政界人士侮辱穆斯林或挑起美国各群体之间的对抗，就不能加强美国在世界上的领导地位。

Obama: A Democrat Will Be the Next President

U.S. President Barack Obama has told fellow party members he is certain a Democrat will be the next president of the United States.

Speaking Thursday in Baltimore, just north of Washington, the president said, "Democrats will win in November and we will have a Democratic president succeeding me - just in case there's any confusion about that."

Obama said he was confident of his prediction because Democrats "focus on the things that matter in the lives of American people."

Obama, in a jab against Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, said that "We're not going to strengthen our leadership around the world by allowing politicians to insult Muslims or pit groups of Americans against each other."

日本中央银行决定实施负利率

日本银行出人意料地决定将利率降至-0.1%。

这一举措将影响金融机构在日本中央银行的账户。先前的存储利率是+0.1%。

日本中央银行星期五投票表决，以五票支持，四票反对的结果通过。日本中央银行随后发表声明警告说，“如果判断有必要”，还可能进一步降息。

负利率意味着金融机构在中央银行的存款不但没有利息，而且还要为存款付费。采取这一举措是为了鼓励银行放贷。

Japan's Central Bank Votes for Negative Interest Rates

In a surprise move, the Bank of Japan has decided to introduce an interest rate of minus 0.1 percent.

The move affects current accounts held by financial institutions at the central bank, which previously offered a miniscule +0.1 percent on deposits.

The central bankers, after their 5-4 vote Friday, issued a statement warning of deeper interest rate cuts into negative territory “if judged as necessary.”

Negative interest rates – something that sounds counterintuitive – means that financial institutions, instead of receiving money for their deposits, must pay to keep their money at the central bank. This is intended to be an incentive for the banks to lend money more freely.
