中国经济放缓，出国热潮不减

中国经济向消费型转变，推动了全球的旅游业。总部设在伦敦的非营利组织世界旅游及旅行理事会说，2015年出国旅游的中国人比上一年增加了53%。

过去5年里，中国旅游人数翻番，增至1亿2000万，每10名国际游客中就有一人来自中国。

去中国旅游的外国人也有所增加，但幅度很小，2015年仅增加了2.2%。在中国，旅游业提供了6500万个就业机会，占中国国内生产总值的7.9%。2015年，将近5700万外国人到中国旅游，他们在中国的消费超过570亿美元。

但这一数字远远低于中国游客在外国的消费。去年，中国游客在外国消费达2150亿美元。

Chinese Stream Abroad Despite Economic Slowdown

China's transition to a consumption-led economy is boosting the global tourism industry. The number of international tourists from China rose 53 percent in 2015 from the year before, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council, a London-based nonprofit that researches global tourism.

Over the last five years, the number of Chinese travelers doubled to 120 million people; one in ten international travelers is now from China.

The number of tourists into China also grew, but slightly, at just 2.2 percent in 2015. Tourism supported 65 million jobs in China, and made up 7.9 percent of the country’s gross domestic product. Nearly 57 million foreign travelers came to China that year, spending more than $57 billion.

But that figure is far less than the amount Chinese tourists are spending on their overseas trips. Last year, travelers from China spent $215 billion outside the country.

新研究预计海平面下世纪将大幅升高

一项新研究显示，由于南极冰川迅速融化，海平面到本世纪末的上升幅度将超过以往的预测。

美国科学家德孔托和波拉德利用复杂的电脑模型发现，按照目前温室气体的排放量估算，世界海平面到2100年将上升将近两米，到2500年将上升多达15米。

与此形成对照的是，联合国的政府间气候变化专门委员会曾预测，世界海平面到2100年将上升不到一米，其主要因素包括海水变暖以及冰山和格陵兰冰架融化。

德孔托和波拉德的研究报告发表在《自然》杂志上。如果他们的预测准确，很多沿海地区都可能受到海平面升高的严重威胁，其中包括美国的佛罗里达南部、新奥尔良、还有上海和孟加拉国。

New Research Predicts Much Higher Sea Levels by Next Century

A new study shows sea levels will rise higher than previously believed by the end of this century, due to rapidly melting ice from Antarctica.

Using sophisticated computer models, American researchers Rob deConto and David Pollard found that at the current rate of greenhouse gas emissions, the world's oceans would rise by close to two meters by the year 2100, and as much as 15 meters by the year 2500.

By contrast, the latest report from the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change had predicted sea levels would rise just under one meter by 2100, mainly from warming seas, melting glaciers and the Greenland ice shelf.

If DeConto and Pollard's predictions, published Wednesday in the journal Nature are correct, many coastal areas, such as south Florida and New Orleans in the United States, the city of Shanghai, and Bangladesh could be seriously threatened by rising sea levels.
