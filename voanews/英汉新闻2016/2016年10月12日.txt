UN Rights Chief: Trump Would be 'Dangerous' President

The U.N.'s human rights chief said Wednesday that if elected the next U.S. president, Donald Trump would be "dangerous from an international point of view."

Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein called some of Trump's comments about vulnerable communities and the use of torture "deeply unsettling and disturbing."

His comments to reporters in Geneva come a month after he said that populist politicians like Trump and Dutch nationalist Geert Wilders are using fear and the promise of a world that has never existed in order to gain appeal.

Zeid said Wednesday he has no plans to tone down those kinds of statements.
