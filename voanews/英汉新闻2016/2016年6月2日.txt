At Least 10 Killed in Somalia Hotel Attack

Witnesses in Somalia's capital say at least 10 people were killed and more than 15 others wounded when militants attacked a major hotel Wednesday.

A Somali lawmaker told VOA that two parliamentarians were killed during the attack. He said a third lawmaker was injured.

One of the lawmakers at the hotel described the attack, saying: "As I was sleeping in my hotel room, I was shocked by a huge explosion. A flying door and window fell on me. I ran toward the back door of the hotel and managed to survive," he said.

A freelance journalist working for VOA reported seeing five dead bodies lying in front of the hotel.

Most of the casualties were reported to be caused by a car bomb that detonated while many people were performing evening prayers.

The assault on Mogadishu's Ambassador Hotel came hours after Somali officials said a top commander of militant group al-Shabab was killed in a late-night military operation.

Mohamed Mohamud allegedly masterminded the April 2015 attack on Kenya's Garissa University College that left 148 people dead, nearly all of them students.
