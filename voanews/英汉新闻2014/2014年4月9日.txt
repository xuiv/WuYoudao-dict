Ukraine Struggles to Keep Control in East

Ukraine is struggling to keep control of key cities in its pro-Russian east as demonstrators seize government buildings and demand votes on joining Russia.

Authorities say shots were fired and at least 60 protesters arrested in Kharkiv Tuesday, while pro-Russian demonstrators held on to government offices captured Sunday in Donetsk.

In Luhansk, Ukrainian authorities say more than 50 people were allowed to leave state security headquarters early Wednesday, where the pro-Russians were allegedly holding 60 hostages. The officials say the protesters have wired the building with explosives.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry accused Russian agents and special forces of stoking separatist unrest in eastern Ukraine. He called the Russian actions "a contrived pretext for military intervention just as we saw in Crimea."

Kerry told a senate committee Tuesday that Moscow's involvement in Ukraine "clear and unmistakable." He said President Barack Obama is preparing more tough sanctions on Russia if it continues destabilizing Ukraine.

Another National Championship for Connecticut Women's Basketball

The Connecticut Huskies won the U.S. women's college basketball championship with a 79-58 rout of Notre Dame in Nashville, Tennessee Tuesday.

The win capped another history-making season for the Huskies since head coach Geno Auriemma took over the program in 1985. Connecticut now has nine National Collegiate Athletic Association titles, and finished the season with 40 consecutive wins and no losses for its fifth undefeated season.

Breanna Stewart, the national player of the year, led the Huskies with 21 points and nine rebounds, while teammate Stefanie Dolson finished with 17 points and 16 rebounds.
Tuesday's win came one night after Connecticut's men's team defeated Kentucky for the men's NCAA Division One title. The men's and women's team achieved the same feat in 2004, the only school to do so.
