Williams, an Academy Award-winning actor and comedian beloved for his rapid-fire, improvisational routines, hanged

himself in his home near San Francisco, California in August. His death shocked fans and admirers flocking to Google to seek information about his career, as well as topics on suicide and depression.

**俄罗斯大幅提高利率仍难阻汇率狂跌**

俄罗斯卢布汇率再创新低，支持卢布的紧急措施看来没有发挥作用。

俄罗斯央行星期一晚上将利率从10.5%提高到17%，增幅之大，出人意料。

央行在俄罗斯货币经历1998年金融危机以来最大单日跌幅之后采取了这一行动。

卢布汇率星期二短时上扬，但很快跌至历史新低，午间为1美元兑66卢布。

这是俄罗斯为制止卢布贬值迄今采取的最大努力。卢布对美元今年已经贬值近50%。

上星期，俄罗斯试图通过将利率提高一个百分点来遏制卢布汇率下滑，但没能奏效。

西方因乌克兰危机对俄罗斯采取制裁措施，再加上石油价格猛跌，卢布面临巨大压力。

克里姆林宫努力让俄罗斯公民相信，卢布贬值是暂时的，最终将恢复其原有价值。

Ruble Plunges to New Lows, Despite Rate Hike

The ruble has tumbled to another historic low, despite an emergency attempt by Russia to prop up the rapidly declining currency.

In a surprise move late Monday, Moscow's Central Bank dramatically raised interest rates to 17 percent from 10.5 percent.

The move came after the Russian currency experienced its largest one-day decline since Russia's 1998 financial crisis.

The ruble briefly rebounded Tuesday, before plummeting to an all-time low. By noon in Moscow, a dollar was buying 66 rubles.

It is Russia's most concerted effort yet to stop the devaluation of the ruble, which has lost almost 50 percent against the dollar this year.

Just last week, Russia attempted, and failed, to stop the decline by raising interest rates by one percent.

The Russian currency has been under intense pressure amid Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis and plunging oil prices.

The Kremlin has tried to reassure Russian citizens the devaluation will be temporary, and that the ruble will eventually regain its value.
