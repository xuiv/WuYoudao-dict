**穆沙拉夫躲过一次疑似暗杀**

前巴基斯坦总统穆沙拉夫星期四看来躲过了一次暗杀，当时一枚炸弹在他的车队经过后爆炸。

警方说，穆沙拉夫当时从拉瓦尔品第的一家医院前往伊斯兰堡郊外的农场住宅。

警方表示，这枚炸弹在法伊扎巴德桥下的一条管道中爆炸，路面上形成一个大坑。

没有人在爆炸中受伤，穆沙拉夫的车队改变了路线。

穆沙拉夫去年结束流亡，返回巴基斯坦，但他由于2007年宣布实行紧急状态法而面临叛国罪指控。

穆沙拉夫2007年暂停实施宪法，并把几名法官解职。检方说，穆沙拉夫这种做法是企图压制反对派的声音。

如被判定罪名成立，穆沙拉夫将面临死刑。

Musharraf Unharmed in Apparent Assassination Attempt

Former Pakistani military leader Pervez Musharraf survived an apparent assassination attempt Thursday when a bomb exploded after his motorcade drove by.

Police say Mr. Musharraf was traveling from a hospital in Rawalpindi to his farmhouse outside Islamabad.

They say a bomb blew up in a pipeline under the Faizabad bridge, leaving a large crater in the road.

No one was injured and the motorcade was rerouted.

Mr. Musharraf returned from exile to Pakistan last year, but found himself facing charges of treason for declaring a state of emergency in 2007.

He suspended the constitution and fired several judges in what prosecutors say was an attempt to silence the opposition.

Mr. Musharraf faces the death penalty if convicted.

**智利致命地震后又发生强烈余震**

智利北部沿海发生8.2级大地震的一天后，该地区又发生一次强烈余震。地震造成六人死亡。

美国地质调查局说，伊基克以南大约23公里处星期三夜间发生一次7.8级地震，震中深度为海平面以下20公里。余震发生后，有关当局在智利沿海地区再次发布海啸警报，并命令沿海地区数千居民撤离。

星期二的地震震撼了大约100公里外智利西北沿海人口稀少的地区，远至日本都发布了海啸警报。几小时后海啸警报解除。

警察和士兵在智利北部沿海地区巡逻，防止抢劫的发生。电视画面显示港口城市伊基克的住房和购物中心受到损坏。伊基克地处圣地亚哥以北1800公里处。

智利总统巴切莱特星期三视察了震区，宣布该地区为灾区。地震导致智利以北秘鲁的电力供应中断，秘鲁南部一些城镇的居民被疏散。不过，没有地震造成严重破坏和伤亡的消息。

Powerful Aftershock Strikes Chile a Day After Deadly Quake

A powerful aftershock has struck off the northern coast of Chile, a day after the region was struck by an 8.2 magnitude quake that killed six people.

The U.S. Geological Survey says a 7.8 magnitude earthquake was detected late Wednesday night ((0243 UTC Thursday morning )) about 23 kilometers south of Iquique, at a depth of 20 kilometers below sea level. The aftershock prompted authorities to issue a new tsunami alert along the Chilean coast and order the evacuation of thousands of coastal residents.

Tuesday's quake struck about 100 kilometers off the country's sparsely populated northwest coast, triggering tsunami warnings as far away as Japan. The warnings were canceled several hours later.

Police and soldiers patrolled northern coastal areas of Chile to prevent looting, as television footage showed damaged homes and shopping centers in the port city of Iquique, 1,800 kilometers north of Santiago.

Chilean President Michelle Bachelet toured the area Wednesday, declaring it a disaster zone. To the north, the quake triggered power outages in Peru, and evacuations in some southern towns there. But there were no reports of serious damage or injuries.
