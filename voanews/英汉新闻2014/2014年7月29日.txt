**美众议院通过议案改组国际广播机构**

美国国会众议院通过一项议案，决定对美国政府的国际广播工作加以改动。

众议院两党议员星期一以口头表决方式通过了这项议案。该议案规定，将以一个新设立的国际通讯署取代现有的美国广播理事会，并将聘用一位全职总裁负责美国之音的运营。

该议案还规定，将把自由欧洲电台\自由电台、自由亚洲电台和中东广播网合并成一个名为“自由新闻网”的非联邦机构。

按照这项议案，美国之音的使命将是支持美国政府的外交工作。包括很多美国之音记者在内的反对者认为，这一改变将大大减弱美国之音在世界范围的公信力。

但该议案的共同发起人、众议院外交委员会主席罗伊斯说，美国有必要在信息战中对俄罗斯和中国等国家进行更有效的反击。

该议案必须在美国国会参议院获得通过，再经美国总统奥巴马签署，才能成为法律。

US House Passes Bill to Overhaul International Broadcasting

The U.S. House of Representatives has approved legislation that would overhaul the government's international broadcasting efforts.

The bipartisan measure passed by a simple voice vote Monday. It would replace the U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors with a new International Communications Agency that would employ a fulltime CEO who would run the Voice of America.

It also would consolidate Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia and the Middle East Broadcasting Network into a non-federal agency called the Freedom News Network.

Under the legislation, VOA’s mission is defined as supporting U.S. public diplomacy efforts. Opponents of the bill, including many current and former VOA journalists, contend it would greatly reduce VOA's worldwide credibility.

But co-sponsor Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, says the United States needs to fight back more effectively in the war of information against countries like Russia and China.

In order to become law, the measure would have to be passed by the U.S. Senate and then be signed by President Barack Obama.

**美国：俄罗斯违反一项核武器条约**

美国指责俄罗斯违反一项具有历史意义的禁止核试验条约，试射了一种陆基巡航导弹。

美国官员说，奥巴马总统星期一致信俄罗斯总统普京，表示美国确定俄罗斯违反了1987年签署的一项条约。《纽约时报》星期一晚间率先报道了这一举措。

美国说，俄罗斯试射一种新型陆基巡航导弹，此举违反了里根总统与苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫签署的中程核武器条约。

签署中程核武器条约是为了销毁射程为5百公里至5千5百公里的陆基巡航导弹。

美国官员说，奥巴马政府愿与俄罗斯就有关问题举行高层会谈，并希望确保俄罗斯遵守有关条约的规定。

莫斯科还没有对此做出回应。

US: Russia Violated Nuclear Treaty

The United States has accused Russia of violating a historic nuclear test ban treaty by testing a ground-launched cruise missile.

U.S officials say President Barack Obama informed Russian President Vladimir Putin in a letter Monday of the U.S.' determination that Russia broke the 1987 treaty. The move was first reported Monday evening by The New York Times.

The U.S. says Russia tested a new ground-launched cruise missile, breaking the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty that President Ronald Reagan signed with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.

The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty was designed to eliminate ground-launched cruise missiles with ranges of 500 to 5,500 kilometers.

U.S. officials said the Obama administration is willing to hold high-level discussions on the issue and wants assurances that Russia will comply with the treaty requirements going forward.

There was no immediate response from Moscow.
