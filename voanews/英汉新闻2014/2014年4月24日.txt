奥巴马星期四在东京会见日本首相安倍晋三
美国总统奥巴马重申，美日安保条约规定美国有义务保护日本，包括东京和北京都宣称拥有主权的一组东海岛屿。

奥巴马星期四在东京会见日本首相安倍晋三后，明确表示尖阁诸岛属于美日安保条约范围，如受到攻击，美国有义务予以保护。

奥巴马强调说，美国在有关岛屿的主权问题上不偏袒任何一方。中国将这些岛屿称为“钓鱼岛”。但奥巴马警告说，任何一方都不应单方面采取行动改变现状。

这是美国总统近来就东海岛屿争端表示支持日本的最强硬的声明。日中两国关系因这一争端而受到严重损害。

针对奥巴马的评论，中国外交部发言人秦刚说，任何事情都不能改变钓鱼岛是中国固有领土的基本事实。

日本是奥巴马此次亚洲八天之行的第一站，随后他还将访问韩国、马来西亚和菲律宾。

Obama: Senkaku Islands Fall Under US-Japan Defense Treaty

President Barack Obama has reaffirmed the U.S. treaty commitment to defend Japan, including a group of East China Sea islands claimed by both Tokyo and Beijing.

Following a Thursday meeting in Tokyo with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Mr. Obama explicitly stated the Senkaku Islands fall under the treaty obliging the United States to defend Japan if attacked.

Mr. Obama stressed the U.S. does not take a position on the sovereignty of the islands, known in China as Diaoyu. But he warned against any unilateral move to change their status quo.

It is the strongest recent statement of support for Japan by a U.S. president regarding the island dispute, which has seriously damaged relations between Japan and China.

Responding to the remarks, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang said nothing will change "the basic reality that the Diaoyu Islands are China's inherent territory."

Japan is the first stop on Mr. Obama's eight-day tour of Asia, which also includes visits in South Korea, Malaysia, and the Philippines.

乌克兰内务部长阿瓦科夫说，乌克兰警察把占据东部城市马里乌波尔市政厅的亲俄罗斯分离主义分子赶了出去。

阿瓦科夫星期四在脸书上说，市政府官员可以返回办公了。他没有细说警方是如何夺回市政厅的，但是他说没有任何伤亡。

乌克兰政府还说，东部阿特米斯克鎮一个军事基地内的乌克兰军队击退了分离主义武装分子的进攻。有一名军人受伤。

乌克兰说，他们再次对占据东乌克兰大约十几个城市政府建筑的亲俄罗斯武装分子采取他们所说的“反恐行动”。 这些武装分子要求就是否脱离乌克兰加入俄罗斯举行全民公投。

美国总统奥巴马星期四在日本对记者说，俄罗斯没有遵守有关缓解乌克兰危机的日内瓦协议，他还表示对俄罗斯合作不抱希望。

奥巴马批评俄罗斯没有做出明智的选择。他表示可能对俄罗斯实施更严厉的制裁。他说，乌克兰一直在实行上星期在日内瓦会议上确定的具体步骤。这些步骤包括赦免在乌克兰东部地区占领政府建筑的亲俄分离主义武装分子。

Ukraine: Police Take Back a City Hall from Separatists, Army Repels Attack on Base

Ukraine's Interior Minister Arsen Avakov says police have driven pro-Russian separatists out of the city hall in the eastern city of Mariupol.

Avakov said in a Facebook post Thursday that city officials are free to return to work. He gave no details how the building was retaken, but reported no casualties.

The government also says Ukrainian forces repelled an attack by armed separatists on an army base in the town of Artemivsk. One soldier was wounded.

Ukraine says it is re-launching what it calls "anti-terrorist" operations against armed pro-Russians who have taken over government buildings in about a dozen eastern cities. The separatists are demanding the right to vote on whether to split with Ukraine and join Russia.

U.S. President Barack Obama, speaking to reporters Thursday in Tokyo, Japan, said Russia is not abiding by the Geneva agreement to ease the crisis in Ukraine and says he is not hopeful the Russians will cooperate.

He said Russia has chosen not to take the "wise path" and faces stronger sanctions, while he says Ukraine has been taking the concrete steps agreed to last week in Geneva. That includes offering amnesty to pro-Russian separatists who leave the buildings peacefully.
