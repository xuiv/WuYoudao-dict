**涉嫌出售过期肉食品 上海福喜5人被拘**

中国警方刑事拘留了上海福喜食品有限公司的5名涉案人员。这家食品供应商被控向麦当劳和肯德基等在中国的连锁快餐店销售过期肉类。

上海警方星期三说，被拘留的5人当中有该公司的负责人和质量经理。福喜食品公司隶属总部设在美国的食品供应商福喜集团。

上海东方卫视星期天报道，福喜食品的工人把过期的肉掺入新鲜的产品中，更换过期食品的标签，甚至肉掉在地上也照用。

官方新华社星期三引述有关官员的话说，福喜食品公司的一些问题不仅局限于个别人，而是“公司组织安排的”。

麦当劳、肯德基、汉堡王，星巴克等餐馆已停止使用福喜的产品。目前尚无因食用过期食物而有多人生病的报道。福喜的一些肉也被销售到日本。

有关报道激怒了很多中国人，他们对食品安全问题特别敏感。最近几年多次发生的食品安全丑闻导致很多人丧生，其中包括一些婴儿。

Arrests Five Involved in Expired Meat Scandal

Chinese police have arrested five employees of a Shanghai-based food supplier accused of selling expired meat to several fast food chains in China, including McDonald's and KFC.

Shanghai police said Wednesday those arrested include the head of the Husi Food Company and its quality manager. Husi Food Company is a unit of the U.S.-based food supplier OSI Group.

China's Dragon TV on Sunday reported workers at Husi were mixing expired meat with fresh product, relabeling out-of-date goods, and using meat that had fallen onto the floor.

The official Xinhua news agency on Wednesday quoted officials as saying some of the problems at Husi were not limited to certain individuals, but were "an arrangement organized by the company."

Restaurants including McDonald's, KFC, Burger King and Starbucks have pulled products using Husi's meat. There have been no reports of widespread sickness. Some of the meat was also sold in Japan.

The report has angered many Chinese, who are particularly sensitive toward food safety issues following repeated food safety scandals in recent years that have killed many people, including infants.

China's Xi Hails Close Ties with Cuba

The head of China's Communist Party, Xi Jinping, hailed the common socialist bond between his country and Cuba as he kicked off a state visit in Havana.

President Xi was welcomed Tuesday by a military guard of honor at the Palace of the Revolution, where he met with Cuban President Raul Castro.

Mr. Castro said his country's ties with China are "at their best in history." Mr. Xi also praised the multi-faceted relationship.

Mr. Xi also met briefly with aging revolutionary leader and former President Fidel Castro as he began his two-day visit.

The trip is meant to expand political ties between the two allies and boost Chinese investment in Cuba.

China is Cuba's biggest international creditor and its second biggest trading partner, behind Venezuela.

On Wednesday, Mr. Xi will travel to Santiago de Cuba, which was hit hard by Hurricane Sandy in 2012.

Cuba is the last stop on a four-nation tour of Latin American countries, some of which have often been shunned by American investors.

The trip also included state visits to Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
