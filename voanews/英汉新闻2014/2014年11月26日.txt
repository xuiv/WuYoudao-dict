**中国辽宁24名矿工死于矿难**

中国官方的新华社报道，中国东北辽宁的一个煤矿星期三发生煤尘燃烧事故，24名矿工丧生，52人受伤。

事故发生在国有阜新矿业集团下属的一个煤矿。这是中国最新一起造成人员伤亡的矿难。

中国政府统计数字显示，去年一年，中国共发生589起与采矿有关的事故，一千多人丧生或失踪。

这个数字比前一年下降了23%。但分析人士认为，实际数字可能比官方数字高得多，因为很多事故没有上报。

中国有关当局一直努力实施更严格的安全标准，并关闭常常不规范作业的小煤矿。

中国是世界上最大的煤炭消费国。

Liaoning mine accident killed 24

China's state media, Xinhua, says 24 workers have been killed and 52 injured Wednesday in a fire at a coal mine in the northeastern part of the country in Liaoning province.

The incident occurred at a mine run by the state-owned Fuxin Coal Company and is the latest deadly mining disaster in China.

Government figures show there were 589 mining-related accidents in China last year, leaving over a thousand people dead or missing.

That is down 23 percent from a year before, but analysts say the actual figure is likely much higher since many incidents are not reported.

Authorities have been working to implement tighter safety standards and shut down small coal mines that often go unregulated.

China is the world's largest consumer of coal.

India Seeks Greater Influence in South Asia

South Asian leaders met in Nepal Wednesday, with regional superpower India seeking to expand its trade and investment influence.

The two sides have recently traded deadly cross-border artillery and gunfire there.
