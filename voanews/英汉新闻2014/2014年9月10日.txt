**克里抵巴格达商讨应对伊斯兰国问题**

美国国务卿克里将在巴格达与伊拉克新政府商讨帮助协调对抗伊斯兰国激进分子的问题。

克里星期三清晨抵达伊拉克首都巴格达，开始为期一周的中东之行，他将会晤伊拉克总理阿巴迪。

美国希望伊拉克新政府能把伊拉克团结起来。前伊拉克领导人将逊尼派少数群体边缘化，加速了极端分子的崛起。

在克里出访之际，美国总统奥巴马星期三将发表讲话，阐述应对伊斯兰国的战略。伊斯兰国控制着伊拉克和叙利亚的部分地区。

白宫官员没有透露奥巴马总统星期三的讲话内容。奥巴马已经排除了向伊拉克派遣军队的可能性。

星期二，奥巴马向国会两院的民主党及共和党领导人概要说明了他的计划。

美国已对伊拉克境内的伊斯兰国目标发动了153次空袭，同时美国官员讨论了扩大空袭行动的可能性。

克里在启程之前说，美国正在争取建立一个广泛的全球联盟，以“对抗、削弱并最终战胜”这个极端组织。

Kerry in Baghdad for Talks on Tackling Islamic State

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is meeting in Baghdad with the new Iraqi government to help coordinate the fight against Islamic State militants.

Kerry, who is beginning a week-long tour in the region, landed early Wednesday in the Iraqi capital, where he will meet with Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi.

The U.S. hopes the new government can unite Iraq, unlike its previous leaders, who were blamed for marginalizing the Sunni minority and helping give rise to extremists.

Kerry's talks come ahead of a Wednesday speech in which President Barack Obama will lay out his strategy to deal with the extremist group, which controls parts of Iraq and Syria.

White House officials have given no specifics on what Mr. Obama plans to say. The president has already ruled out sending U.S. forces back into Iraq.

On Tuesday the president briefed Democratic and Republican leaders from both houses of Congress on his plan.

The United States has already carried out 153 airstrikes on Islamic State targets inside Iraq, and U.S. officials have discussed the possibility of expanding that campaign.

Ahead of his trip, Kerry said the U.S. is trying to form a broad global coalition to "confront, degrade and ultimately defeat" the Islamic State group.

**日本批准重启两座核反应堆**

日本原子能规制委员会最终核准重新启用两座核反应堆。3年前，这两座核反应堆在福岛核电站发生熔毁事故后关闭。

日本原子能规制委员会星期三说，日本西南部的仙台核电站可能重新启动，但还需要得到当地政府的批准。

一些活动人士说，由于附近有火山，该核电站不安全，但日本原子能规制委员会认为这种危险微乎其微。

2011年地震和海啸后日本对核电站制定了更严格的标准。仙台核电站是根据这些标准重新启用的第一个。

福岛核电站事故使周边地区遭到核辐射，此后日本当局关闭了所有核反应堆并加以维修。自那时以来，日本转而依靠矿物燃料，民众要承受较高的能源价格。

但日本国内反对核能源的声音仍然很强。安倍首相的官邸前不断发生抗议活动。安倍一直努力推动日本重启核电站。

日本能源短缺，核能源一度占日本所需能源总量的四分之一以上。

Japan Approves Restart of Two Nuclear Reactors

Japan's nuclear regulator has given final approval to restart two reactors shut down following the Fukushima nuclear meltdown three years ago.

The Nuclear Regulation Authority said Wednesday that the Sendai power plant in southwestern Japan could reopen, although local approval is still needed.

Some activists say the plant is not safe because of nearby volcanoes, though regulators have said the danger from this is minimal.

It would be the first of Japan's nuclear plants to restart under stricter standards following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami disaster.

Japan switched off its nuclear reactors for maintenance after the Fukushima accident crippled the plant and exposed the surrounding area to radiation. Since then, Japanese citizens have faced higher energy prices as the nation switched its dependence to fossil fuels.

But opposition to nuclear energy in Japan remains strong, with repeated protests staged in front of the office of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has been pushing to get Japan's nuclear plants running again.

Nuclear energy once supplied more than quarter of the power in resource-starved Japan.
