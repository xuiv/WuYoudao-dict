**朝鲜核与导弹项目正在取得进展**

一位美国高级情报官员以及华盛顿研究机构的一篇报告警告说，朝鲜的核项目和导弹项目正在取得进展。

国家情报总监詹姆斯•克莱珀星期三说，平壤扩大了宁边的铀浓缩设施的规模，重启了一座用于生产钸的反应堆。

这一声明似乎证实了最近的一篇报告，这份报告说，朝鲜在去年进行了第三次核试验之后，正在落实“整改”核设施的诺言。

克莱珀在为参议院一个委员会提供的书面证词中也说到朝鲜的核武器和导弹项目对美国和亚洲“构成严重威胁”，指出平壤正着手发展一种能够袭击美国本土的导弹。

克莱珀说，朝鲜已经公开展示了KN-98型公路机动洲际弹道导弹，但是他强调，这种导弹系统还没有经过试验。

星期三，约翰•霍布金斯大学美韩研究所发表的一项报告说，朝鲜看来正在扩大其发射系统，以适应发射能够打到美国的更大型的导弹。


NKorea Nuclear, Missile Programs Making Progress

A senior U.S. intelligence official and a report by a Washington-based research institute are warning of advances in North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.

Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Wednesday Pyongyang has expanded the size of its Yongbyon uranium enrichment facility and restarted a reactor used for plutonium production.

The statement appeared to confirm recent reports suggesting North Korea is making good on its promise to "adjust and alter" its nuclear facilities following its third nuclear test last year.

In his written testimony to a Senate committee, Clapper also said the North's nuclear weapons and missile programs "pose a serious threat" to the U.S. and Asia, noting that Pyongyang is committed to developing a missile that can strike the U.S. mainland.

Clapper said that the North has publicly displayed its road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles, known as the KN-98, but stressed that the system remains untested.

In a separate report Wednesday, the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University said North Korea appears to be expanding its main launch site to accommodate larger missiles that could hit the U.S.

**青少年流行音乐歌星在加拿大和美国反驳指控**


流行乐坛青少年歌手贾斯汀•比伯星期三被控袭击罪，他被指控在加拿大多伦多殴打一名轿车司机。此前，这位年少成名的歌星已经惹上了一系列的法律麻烦。

今年19岁、加拿大出生的比伯星期三到多伦多一处警察局自首，大批摄影师和歌迷不顾严寒簇拥在他的周围。

比伯的律师后来对记者说，他的当事人3月10日在多伦多出庭时将做无罪辩护。

对比伯的指控源自12月30日发生的事件，当时，一名加长豪华轿车司机在多伦多一家夜总会接比伯和其他五个人。这名司机后来从车里出来，打电话给警察，表示他的头部多次挨打。

另外也在星期三，贾斯汀•比伯对美国佛罗里达州提起的一系列指控进行了无罪辩护，这些指控包括酒后及服药后驾车、拒捕以及持过期驾照开车。比伯本月初在佛罗里达迈阿密一条居民区的街上飚车时被捕。

警方说，他在被捕时辱骂警察，他后来承认喝酒、吸大麻，还服用了处方药。

Teen Pop Star Battles Charges in Canada, U.S.


Teen pop singer Justin Bieber was charged Wednesday with assault for allegedly hitting a limousine driver in Toronto, adding to a string of legal troubles for the young star.

The 19-year-old Canada native turned himself in at a Toronto police station Wednesday as crowds of photographers and fans surged around him and his security team despite frigid temperatures.

Bieber's attorney later told reporters his client will plead innocent when he appears in a Toronto courtroom March 10.

The charges stem from an incident December 30, in which a limousine driver picked up Bieber and five other people at a Toronto nightclub. The driver later got out of the vehicle and called police after allegedly being hit in the head several times.

Also Wednesday, Bieber pleaded not guilty to charges in the U.S. state of Florida of driving under the influence ((of alcohol and prescription drugs)), resisting arrest, and driving with an expired license. Bieber was arrested earlier this month after police caught him drag racing on a residential street in Miami, Florida.

Police said he cursed at officers at the time of his arrest, and that he later admitted to drinking alcohol, smoking marijuana and taking prescription drugs.
