**武装分子继续在悉尼扣押多名人质**

澳大利亚城市悉尼星期一上午发生的人质危机已经持续了16个多小时，一名枪手仍将一些人质扣押在悉尼的一家咖啡厅里，目前无法确定里面究竟有多少人质。

新南威尔士警察总监斯皮奥恩拒绝把这一事件称作恐怖行动，但表示事件可能会持续数天。

澳大利亚总理阿博特说，发生在市中心林特巧克力咖啡厅的绑架可能有政治动机。

危机发生后，一度可以看到人质举起双手，靠在窗户上。透过玻璃窗，还可以看到一面黑旗，上面用白色阿拉伯文字写着被称为清真言的伊斯兰信条。

有5名人质逃出餐馆。目前还不清楚这5人是被枪手释放，还是自己逃脱。据估计，人质在10到25人之间。

AUSTRALIA HOSTAGES 4th UPD - V

A gunman continues to hold an unknown number of people hostage in a Sydney, Australia, restaurant, nearly 16 hours after the siege began Monday morning.

New South Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione refused to call the situation a terrorist act, but suggested the ordeal could last for days.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the incident at the Lindt Chocolat Cafe in the city's central business district may be politically motivated.

Early in the crisis, hostages were seen standing with their hands pushed up against the windows. A black flag with the Islamic creed known as the Shahada written in white could be seen through the glass.

((OPT: The phrase is a declaration of faith for Muslims around the world and translates to "There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is his messenger." Radical Islamist militants, including the Islamic State group, have coopted the the Shahada to use on their flags.))

Five people fled to safety from the cafe, though it remains unclear whether they escaped or were released. An estimated 10 to 25 hostages remain inside.
