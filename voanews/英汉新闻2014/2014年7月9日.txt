**佐科威宣布当选印尼总统**

印尼雅加达省省长佐科威宣布在总统大选中获胜。 之前的初步点票结果显示，佐科威的得票率略高于退役将军普拉博沃。

星期三大选的非正式结果显示，在点算了80%多的选票之后，佐科威的票数领先普拉博沃大约5%。

普拉博沃还没有承认败选。他表示，选举胜负仍然未定。据估计，最终结果将在两星期后揭晓。

印尼是世界第三大民主国家。这次争夺激烈的选举对于印尼1亿9千万名符合资格的选民来说，意味着截然不同的选择。
富豪出身的退役将军普拉博沃曾是印尼已故独裁者苏哈托的女婿。他的竞选纲领强调民族主义。很多人担心，普拉博沃可能会把印尼带上更为专制的道路。有人指责普拉博沃在军中任职期间有违反人权的行为。

佐科威的出身平凡。为政清廉是其选战的主要内容。直到几个月前，曾经经营家具业的佐科威被普遍看好，但在有关他不是穆斯林的指称传出后，其选情受到影响。

Indonesia's Jokowi Claims Victory in Presidential Election

Jakarta Governor Joko Widodo has claimed victory in Indonesia's presidential election, after early results suggested he has a slight lead over ex-army General Prabowo Subianto.

Unofficial results from the Wednesday election indicated Widodo, also known as Jokowi, has about a five percent lead over Subianto with more than 80 percent of the votes counted.

Subianto has not conceded defeat, saying it is too early to call the race. The final outcome was not expected to be released for two weeks.

The tightly contested election represents a stark choice for the 190 million eligible voters in Indonesia, the world's third-largest democracy.

Subianto is a wealthy former general and the ex-son-in-law of Indonesia's late dictator Suharto. He has campaigned on a strong nationalist platform. Many fear Subianto could steer the country in a more authoritarian direction, noting allegations of human rights abuses in his military career.

Widodo has more humble roots and campaigned on what is seen as his clean political record. Until a few months ago, the ex-furniture entrepreneur was widely expected to win. But he has lost ground following accusations he is not a Muslim.

**台风浣熊肆虐日本**

台风浣熊在日本南部冲绳岛造成暴雨之后侵入日本人口稠密地区。

台风浣熊星期三经过冲绳岛时造成2人死亡，至少28人受伤，5万两千所住宅断电。

虽然有所减弱，但台风每小时的风速仍为162公里。人们现在主要担心的是移动缓慢的风暴带来的暴雨。

天气预报警告说，在星期四中午以前的24小时里，九州岛可能至少有300毫米的降雨量。台风星期四转向位于本州岛的东京和大阪。

日本雨季即将结束，台风浣熊此时来袭特别容易引起洪水和塌方。

虽然日本每年都会遭遇几次台风，但今年在七月初就刮台风实在不同寻常。

Typhoon Neoguri Takes Aim at Japan

Typhoon Neoguri is taking aim at Japan's most populous areas after dumping torrential rains on the southern islands of Okinawa.

Two people were killed and at least 28 injured as the storm moved across Okinawa on Wednesday, leaving 52,000 houses without power.

Though it has weakened, Neoguri is still packing wind gusts of up to 162 kilometers per hour. But the main concern now is the slow-moving storm's heavy rainfall.

Forecasters warn that the island of Kyushu could see at least 300 millimeters of rain in a 24-hour period through mid-day Thursday, when it begins heading towards Tokyo and the city of Osaka, located on the main island of Honshu

Neoguri is posing a particular threat of landslides and floods, since it is hitting Japan at the end of its rainy season.

Japan usually is hit by several typhoons each year, but it is unusual for such a storm to hit as early as July.
