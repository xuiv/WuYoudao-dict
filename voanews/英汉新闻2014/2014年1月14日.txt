China: Baby-Stealing Obstetrician Gets Suspended Death Penalty

A Chinese court has given a suspended death sentence to a doctor convicted of stealing seven newborn babies and selling them to human traffickers.

The Weinan Intermediate Court in northern Shaanxi province on Tuesday announced the sentence, which in China usually amounts to life imprisonment.

Zhang Shuxia, who delivered babies at a hospital in Shaanxi province's Fuping county, acknowledged in court to trafficking the seven babies.

The 55-year-old female obstetrician was accused of persuading parents to give up their children after falsely claiming they had serious, congenital diseases.

Six of the children have been rescued, but one died after being trafficked for $165.

The sale of children is a major problem in China, where analysts say a strict one-child policy has helped create demand exploited by underground trafficking rings.

泰国总理英拉表示不会在压力下答应反对派的要求。泰国曼谷连续两天发生大规模反政府抗议活动。

英拉星期二对记者说，她必须继续担任总理，这是她的宪法职责。她还说，只有通过合作对话才能解决持续了一个月的政治僵局。

英拉总理已经解散了议会，宣布在2月2日提前举行选举，并提议组成全国改革委员会，以解决这场持续数月的政治危机。

Despite Protests, Thailand's PM Says She Won't Resign

Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra says she will not give in to opposition demands she resign, despite two days of large anti-government protests in Bangkok.

Mrs. Shinawatra told reporters Tuesday she has a constitutional duty to stay on as prime minister, and that only cooperation and dialogue can resolve the country's months-long political deadlock.

She spoke as thousands of opposition protesters filled Bangkok streets for a second day, waving flags and blowing whistles outside several government buildings in an attempt to disrupt official business.

Their leader, ex-Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaugsuban, said he will keep up the protests, and even threatened to detain his rival if she does not step down soon.

The protests initially aimed to "shut down" the capital. But life continued as usual in most parts of the city Tuesday, though traffic was lighter than usual and protesters blocked several key intersections.

Prime Minister Yingluck has dissolved parliament, called for early elections on February 2, and proposed the formation of a national reform council as a way to resolve the months-long political crisis.
