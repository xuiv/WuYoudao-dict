**克卿将在慕尼黑会见乌克兰反对派领袖**

美国官员说，克里国务卿即将跟乌克兰反对派领导人举行首次会谈。去年11月以来，他们一直领导乌克兰反政府的抗议行动。

正在德国访问的克里将于星期六在慕尼黑会见反对派政治人物亚采纽克和曾经是拳击冠军克的活动人士克利钦科。

与此同时，乌克兰抗议者星期五对反对派活动人士布勒托夫据称被绑架后受伤表示愤怒。布勒托夫1月22日起失踪，1月30日晚间人们在基辅郊外找到他，当时他的脸上有割伤和擦伤。布勒托夫说，他被不明身份的人绑架，被扣押了几天，然后被丢弃在一片树林里。布勒托夫说，他设法去到附近的一个村庄，通过电话跟他的朋友联系上。

最近有报道说，乌克兰政治动乱期间发生了死亡、绑架和酷刑事件。联合国人权官员要求乌克兰总统亚努科维奇对上述报道的事件展开调查。

乌克兰总统亚努科维奇发表声明，指责反对派领导人不断升级这场政治危机。他说，他们鼓动人们在寒冷的天气里站在外面，就是为了推动他们的政治野心。他说，为了结束对峙，政府已履行其义务，其中包括有条件赦免被逮捕的示威者和撤换他的总理。


Kerry to Meet With Ukraine Opposition in Munich



U.S. officials say Secretary of State John Kerry will hold his first meeting with members of the Ukrainian opposition who have been leading anti-government protests in the country since November.

Kerry, on a visit to Germany, will hold talks Saturday with opposition politician Arseny Yatsenyuk and former boxing champion-turned-activist Vitali Klitschko.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian protesters were expressing outrage after opposition activist Dmytro Bulatov, missing since January 22, was found outside Kyiv Thursday with cuts and bruises to his face. Bulatov says he was kidnapped by unknown abductors and held for days before being abandoned in a forest. He says he made his way to a nearby village where he reached his friends by phone.

The United Nations human rights office has called on Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych to investigate recent reports of deaths, kidnappings and torture during the nation's political unrest.

President Yanukovych has issued a statement accusing opposition leaders of escalating the political crisis. He said they are encouraging people to stand outside in freezing weather just to advance their political ambitions. Mr. Yanukovych says the government has fulfilled its obligations to end the standoff, including a conditional amnesty for arrested protesters and replacing his prime minister.

**俄男子寿命短或与喝伏特加过量有关**

研究人员说，喝大量伏特加酒的俄罗斯男子有提早死亡的“超常”高风险。

周四在《柳叶刀》医学期刊上发表的一项研究详细介绍了科学家的发现。这些科学家在1999年和2010年之间跟踪研究了大约151,000名成年人。在这段时间内死亡的参加这项研究的8000人当中，有许多被确认是大量饮用伏特加的人。

研究人员说，他们在那些死于诸如事故、自杀和暴力等外部原因的人当中发现伏特加酒的过量饮用。他们说，55岁之前的死亡的风险对于那些每周喝三瓶或更多瓶半公升装的伏特加酒的人为35％。

专家说，俄罗斯男人的总体平均寿命为64岁，这使俄罗斯成为世界上人均寿命最短的国家之一。

Study: Russian Men Dying Early From Heavy Vodka Use

Researchers say Russian men who drink large amounts of vodka have an "extraordinarily" high risk of early death.

A study published Thursday in The Lancet medical journal details the findings of scientists who tracked about 151,000 adults between the years of 1999 and 2010. Of the 8,000 people in the study who died during that time, many were found to be heavy drinkers of vodka.

The researchers said they found excess vodka use among those dying of external causes, such as accident, suicide and violence. They say risk of death before age 55 among those who drank three or more half-liter bottles of vodka a week was 35 percent.

Experts say the overall average life expectancy for a Russian man is 64 years, which puts it among the nations with the lowest life expectancies in the world.
