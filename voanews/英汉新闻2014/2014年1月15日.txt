**总理：泰国选举不推迟**

泰国政府说，尽管反对派抵制选举并在首都连续三天举行反政府抗议活动，将按原定计划在2月2日提前举行选举。
在宣布这一决定之前，泰国内阁成员和看守总理英拉举行了会谈。英拉说，政府无权按照选举委员会的建议推迟选举。
反对派抗议领导人拒绝参加星期三的会谈。他们坚持主张，在实行改革和英拉辞职之前不应举行选举。
与此同时，抗议者连续第三天在曼谷举行示威游行，此前有报道说，夜间发生小规模暴力。
安全官员说，一个高档购物区附近凌晨发生枪击事件，一名男子和一名女子受了轻伤。抗议者在那里建立了一个很大的帐篷营地。
有关当局还在调查著名反对派领袖阿披实的住宅夜间可能遭到袭击事件。警方说，一个小爆炸装置被扔进阿披实的住宅，屋顶受到轻微损坏，爆炸装置可能是一个大爆竹。阿披实当时不在家中，没有人受伤。

No Delay for Thailand Elections: PM

Thailand's government says early elections will be held as planned on February 2, despite an opposition boycott and three days of anti-government protests in the capital.

The announcement followed a meeting between cabinet members and caretaker Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. She said the government has no authority to postpone the vote, as the election commission had proposed.

Opposition protest leaders refused to attend the Wednesday meeting. They insist that no vote should be held until reforms are made and Mrs. Yingluck resigns.

Meanwhile, protesters marched in Bangkok for a third straight day, following overnight reports of small-scale violence.

Security officials say a man and woman suffered minor injuries in an early morning shooting near an upscale shopping district where the protesters have set up camp.

Authorities are also investigating a possible overnight attack on the home of prominent opposition leader Abhisit Vejjajiva. Police say a small explosive device, possibly a large firework, was thrown onto the property of Abhisit, causing minor damage to the roof. He was not home at the time and no one was injured.


**波音“梦幻客机”又现电池问题**

又一架波音787客机因电池问题而停飞。一年前，一个类似的问题导致世界各地的波音787客机停飞数月。
日本航空公司说，一名技师星期二在东京成田国际机场对一架“梦幻客机”进行例行维修时，发现驾驶室底下冒出白烟。
经过调查发现，这架波音787的八个锂电池中的一个发生泄漏。调查报告说，一个用来释放过多压力的安全阀运作正常，没有起火。
日航用另一架“梦幻客机”换下这架客机，并表示在进行例行维修检查后，日航的其他波音787将照常飞行。
去年，一架停放的波音787客机因电池问题起火，导致另一架飞机紧急迫降，随后世界各地的50架波音787停飞三个多月。

More Battery Problems for Boeing's Dreamliner Jet

Battery problems have prompted the grounding of another Boeing 787, a year after a similar issue led to a months-long global suspension of the jet's flights.

Japan Airlines says a mechanic Tuesday saw white smoke rising from beneath the cockpit of a parked Dreamliner during routine maintenance at Tokyo's Narita International Airport.

An investigation found one of the eight cells of the plane's troubled lithium-ion battery had leaked. It said a safety valve meant to release excess pressure had worked properly and it did not catch fire.

JAL replaced the plane with another Dreamliner jet, and said it will keep flying its other 787s following routine maintenance checks.

The worldwide fleet of 50 Dreamliners was grounded for more than three months last year after battery problems sparked a fire in a parked plane and forced the emergency landing of another.
