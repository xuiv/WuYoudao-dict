Actor Robin Williams Dead of Apparent Suicide

Tributes have been pouring in for actor-comedian Robin Williams, who was found dead at his home near San Francisco, California, the victim of an apparent suicide. He was 63.

U.S. President Barack Obama praised Williams as a "one of a kind" performer who "touched every element of the human spirit."

Local authorities say they believe Williams died from asphyxia, but the exact cause of death is still under investigation.

The entertainer's publicist issued a statement late Monday saying Williams had recently been battling depression. Williams developed a drug and alcohol problem early in his career, and had admitted himself into a rehabilitation facility just a few weeks ago to help him maintain his sobriety.

Williams was a stand-up comedian when he made his television debut in the late 1970s playing an alien on the situation comedy "Mork and Mindy." He moved into motion pictures and won acclaim for numerous roles, including "Mrs. Doubtfire," "Good Morning Vietnam," "Dead Poets Society," and "Good Will Hunting," which earned him an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in 1998.

WHO to Release Result of Talks on Ethics of Experimental Ebola Drugs

The World Health Organization is due to release Tuesday the outcome of a meeting on the ethical considerations for using experimental drugs to treat Ebola, as governments try to find ways to combat the worst-ever outbreak of the disease.

The discussion comes as Liberia prepares to receive a shipment of an experimental drug from a U.S. company to treat two Liberian doctors infected with Ebola.

Liberian officials said Monday they expected the drug called ZMapp to arrive in a matter of days. The drug's manufacturer said in a statement its supply has now been exhausted after fulfilling a request from an unnamed West African country.

ZMapp has not been tested for safety in humans. A Spanish priest infected with Ebola was due to receive the drug, but a Madrid hospital announced Tuesday he had died.

The drug is also being used to treat two U.S. aid workers who have shown signs of improvement, though what role the drug is playing is not clear.

The WHO says more than 1,000 people have died since the outbreak began in February, most of them in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Nigeria's health ministry confirmed a new case of Ebola on Monday. Officials there say 10 people have been infected and two people have died.

The current Ebola outbreak in West Africa is on pace to infect more people than all previous outbreaks of the virus combined. The disease has no known cure or vaccine.
