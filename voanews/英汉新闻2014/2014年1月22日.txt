**中国网络大规模瘫痪 原因不详**

中国互联网络星期二（1月21日）发生大规模瘫痪，用户被自动转到总部在美国的动态网公司为规避中国网络审查而设立的网页。

这次网络瘫痪持续了几小时。分析人士到目前为止仍不清楚造成问题的原因。

政府经营的中国互联网信息中心说，这次状况是服务器故障造成的，而官方的新华社说，这一事件有可能是网络攻击造成的后果。

数以百万计的网络用户受到了影响，很多网民一上网就被自动转入“动态网公司”(DIT)的网页。这个公司向被中国政府取缔的法轮功以及其他公司出售翻越防火墙的网络工具。

动态网公司的网站在中国被封。该公司否认有任何责任关系，并示意说，网络瘫痪源头在中国一端。

中国当局封锁很多海外网站，包括脸书、推特以及多数外国重要新闻网站。当局将这些网站看成是对共产党统治的威胁。

China Experiences Major Internet Outage; Cause Unclear

A major Internet outage in China has resulted in users being redirected to the website of a United States-based company that aims to circumvent Chinese web censorship.

Analysts are still unclear about what led to the issue, which lasted for several hours on Tuesday.

The government-run China Internet Network Information Center blamed the outage on a server malfunction. But the official Xinhua news agency reported the incident may have been caused by hackers.

Many of the millions of affected users were redirected to the site of Dynamic Internet Technology. The company sells anti-censorship tools to companies including the Falun Gong, a religious sect banned in China.

DIT, whose website is blocked in China, denied responsibility, suggesting the cause for the outage was on the Chinese end.

China blocks access to many overseas websites, including Facebook, Twitter, and most major foreign news outlets, viewing them as a threat to the Communist Party's grip on power.

**阿萨德去留问题在叙利亚和平会议引起激辩**

来自30多个国家、联合国以及叙利亚交战方的代表团在瑞士召开期盼已久的和平会议，叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德的政治未来从一开始便成为引起分歧的话题。

美国国务卿约翰·克里星期三尖锐批评了叙利亚政府。他说，在叙利亚危机刚开始的时候，政府军针对和平示威使用武力并不断加剧。他说，由于叙利亚政府和反对派在阿萨德何去何从的问题上有分歧，一个经过双方同意组建的过渡政府不能有他的位置。

克里说：“根本就不可能想象，一个领头残暴对付本国人民的人，能够重新获得执政的合法性。”

叙利亚外长瓦立德·穆阿里姆对克里说，只有叙利亚人才有权选择他们的总统。俄罗斯外长谢尔盖·拉夫罗夫也重申了俄方的立场，也就是叙利亚事务不能由其它国家说了算。


Assad's Future Sparks Sharp Debate at Syrian Peace Conference

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's political future has been a divisive issue as delegations from more than 30 countries, the United Nations and Syria's warring sides meet for a long-awaited peace conference in Switzerland.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry sharply criticized the Syrian government Wednesday, saying the country's crisis began as soldiers used "increasing force" against peaceful demonstrations. He said that because the government and opposition differ on Mr. Assad's fate, the Syrian leader cannot be a part of a mutually agreed transitional government.

"There is no way, no way possible in the imagination that the man who has led the brutal response to his own people could regain the legitimacy to govern."

Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem told Kerry that only Syrians have the right to choose their president. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also reiterated his country's stance that other nations should not have a say in Syria's affairs.
