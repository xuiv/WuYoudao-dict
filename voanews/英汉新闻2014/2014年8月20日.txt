**日本山体滑坡至少27人丧生**

日本官员说，广岛郊区发生山体滑坡，几十所房屋被泥土掩埋，造成至少27人死亡，10人失踪。

星期三的电视画面显示，当地居民和救援人员在房屋废墟中寻找生还者。

日本首相安倍晋三派遣数百名军人赶赴灾区，协助救援工作。

一名本地居民说，他半夜醒来，发现房子已经进水，于是匆忙驾车离开住所。

该地区在24小时内降雨约24毫米，大约相当于一个月的降雨量，使得已经受到最近暴雨影响的山体发生松动。

气象预报说，未来还会有降雨，该地区将面临洪水和滑坡双重危险。

在人口密集的日本，很多住宅建在很陡的山坡附近，因此山体滑坡是一个严重威胁。

27 Dead in Japan Landslides

Japanese officials say at least 27 people were killed and 10 are missing after landslides buried dozens of houses in the outskirts of Hiroshima.

Television footage on Wednesday showed residents and rescue workers searching through the rubble of suburban homes for survivors.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has ordered several hundred soldiers to the area to help with rescue efforts.

The area received about 24 millimeters, or about a month's worth, of rain within a 24-hour period, loosening hills already soaked by recent storms.

Forecasters warn that more rain is expected, saying there is a continued risk of flooding and landslides.

Landslides pose a major risk in crowded Japan, where many homes are built on or near steep slopes.


**和谈破裂 以色列哈马斯再度交火**

在加沙地带交战双方的和谈破裂之后，以色列军队继续对加沙地带进行空袭，同时激进分子又开始向以色列境内发射火箭弹。

以色列军方星期三说，已实施30次夜间空袭，而激进分子从加沙地带发射了约70枚火箭弹。

停火维持了10天，在此期间谈判代表们在开罗举行会谈，寻找持久结束6星期前爆发的这场危机的途径。巴勒斯坦方面要求以色列结束对加沙地带的封锁，而以色列要求哈马斯解除武装，双方未能就这些要求达成协议。

在停火于星期二夜间到期的几小时前，激进分子的火箭弹就落入以色列境内，随后以色列发动空袭。巴勒斯坦当局说，空袭造成一名妇女和一名两岁女孩死亡。

Israel, Hamas Exchange Rocket Fire as Cease-Fire, Truce Talks Collapse

Israeli forces are continuing to carry out airstrikes in the Gaza Strip, while militants there fire more missiles toward Israel following the collapse of peace talks between the warring sides.

The Israeli military said Wednesday it conducted 30 airstrikes overnight, and that militants had launched some 70 missiles from the Palestinian territory.

The fighting had paused for 10 days while negotiators met in Cairo to search for a long-term end to the crisis that began six weeks ago. Those talks have yielded no agreement on Palestinian demands that Israel end its blockade of Gaza or Israel's desire that Hamas be demilitarized.

Militant rockets flew into Israel hours before the end of the cease-fire late Tuesday, bringing Israeli strikes that Palestinian authorities said killed a woman and a 2-year-old girl.
