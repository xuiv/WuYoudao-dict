**美国参议院将表决任命耶伦为中央银行行长问题**

美国国会参议院看来将批准耶伦接任美国中央银行首脑职位，使她成为世界经济领域权势最大的人之一。

按照预定安排，美国参议院将于星期一晚间就任命耶伦为美国联邦储备委员会主席一事进行表决。分析人士说，她将得到足够的票数，获得这项任命。耶伦将接替伯南克，成为有着1百年历史的美联储的首位女主席。伯南克的八年任期将于1月底届满。

美联储主席经常影响着世界范围的经济决策。经济学家们预计，现年67岁的耶伦将继续执行伯南克的许多政策。耶伦目前担任美联储副主席。伯南克和耶伦都主张逐步结束美联储对美国经济的直接支持，并继续保持低利率。

美国最大银行摩根大通的首席经济学家格拉斯曼对美国之音说，在美国这个世界最大经济体从2008年至2009年的大幅衰退中复苏之际，美联储将根据美国经济的表现来制定政策。

US Senate Voting on Yellen as Central Bank Chief

The U.S. Senate appears set to confirm Janet Yellen as the new chair of the country's central bank, making her one of the most powerful figures in world economic circles.

The Senate is scheduled to vote late Monday on her nomination as chair of the Federal Reserve and analysts say she has enough votes to win confirmation. She would become the first woman to head the 100-year-old agency and replace Ben Bernanke when his eight-year tenure expires at the end of January.

The head of the U.S. Federal Reserve has often influenced world economic decisions. Economists are predicting that the 67-year-old Yellen, the Fed's current vice chair, will continue many of Bernanke's policies. They both have called for a gradual end to the central bank's direct support of the U.S. economy and continued low interest rates.

The chief economist at the country's biggest bank, James Glassman of JPMorgan Chase, tells VOA that Federal Reserve policies will be shaped by the performance of the world's largest economy as it recovers from its steep recession in 2008 and 2009.

**韩国呼吁恢复让韩战离散家庭团聚活动**

韩国总统朴槿惠呼吁恢复让韩战离散家庭团聚活动，并承诺为贫困的朝鲜提供更多人道援助。

朴槿惠星期一在电视转播的新年记者会上表示，希望能在1月31日的农历新年举办离散家庭团聚活动，以“弥合心头的创伤”。

朝鲜领导人金正恩上星期发表新年讲话，呼吁同韩国改善关系，同时在讲话中发出核战争威胁。

朴槿惠总统星期一做出回应说，重要的不是言辞，而是行动和诚意。她对记者们说，金正恩的姑父张成泽上月被处决后，朝鲜的行为变得更加难以预测。

朝鲜去年取消了一次离散家庭团聚，并将此归咎于韩国方面的敌意。

South Korea Calls for Renewed Family Reunions

South Korea's president has called for resuming reunions of families separated by the Korean War, and promised increased humanitarian aid to the impoverished North.

At her televised New Year news conference Monday, President Park Geun-hye said she wants the reunions to take place on the Lunar New Year's Day on January 31 to "heal wounded hearts."

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called last week for improved ties in his New Year's Day speech, which also included a threat of nuclear war.

President Park responded Monday that what is important is not words, but action and sincerity. She told reporters that since the execution of Kim Jong Un's uncle, Jang Song Thaek last month, it has been harder to predict what the North might do next.

North Korea canceled a round of reunions last year, blaming hostility from the South.
