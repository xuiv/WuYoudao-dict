China Appeals for Int'l Support in 'War Against Terrorism'

China is appealing to the international community for "more understanding and support" in what it describes as its fight against terrorism.

The appeal came after masked attackers armed with swords killed 29 people and injured 130 more at a train station in the southwest city of Kunming.

Fu Ying is a spokeswoman for the National People's Congress, which opens Wednesday amid heavy security in Beijing.

Beijing has blamed the attack on militants from the northwest region, Xinjiang, where the mainly Muslim Uighur ethnic minority complains of repression by the government.

Unrest involving Uighurs is not uncommon in Xinjiang. The government has for years quickly labeled any such violence - even street riots or shootouts during police raids - as terrorist attacks.
