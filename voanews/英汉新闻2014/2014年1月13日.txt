**Iran Nuclear Deal to Take Effect Jan. 20**

A deal to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for limited sanctions relief is set take effect January 20.

Officials from both sides confirmed the start date Sunday, after experts spent weeks discussing how to implement the six-month pact they first agreed to in November.

Iran will limit its uranium enrichment to five percent and reduce its stock of higher-enriched uranium, while also allowing United Nations inspectors to access nuclear facilities.

In exchange, the United States and European Union will ease sanctions that have squeezed Iran's economy.

Iran and the six world powers, which include the U.S., Britain, China, France, Russia and Germany, will use the six months to continue negotiations on a long-lasting deal to address fears that Iran is seeking to build nuclear weapons.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said reaching a comprehensive agreement will be tough, but that the negotiations are the best way to resolve the issue "peacefully and durably."
