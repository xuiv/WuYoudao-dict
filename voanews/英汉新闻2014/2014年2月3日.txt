**泰国反政府抗议者不承认选举**

泰国反政府抗议者不承认星期日的提前选举，并且誓言要把大规模街头抗议进行下去，以推翻总理英拉的看守政府。

主要在野党民主党抵制了选举，抗议者在几十个选区阻拦选票分发、阻止选民进入投票站，以这些方式干扰投票的进行。
看守政府表示将为星期日无法投票的大约10%的选民举行第二轮投票。不过，选举委员会星期一说，在抗议结束前无法安排补选。

抗议者星期一说，他们无意离开街头，将在几个层次上继续抗争，以争取让选举作废。他们提出的法理依据之一是，按照法律要求，选举必须在一天之内进行。

与此同时，抗议者正在拆除一些营地，以整合其它抗议地点的力量。

预计投票结果要几个星期才能揭晓，在投票被打断的选区重新选举之前，获胜的党派无法组建新政府。

Anti-Government Protesters Dismiss Thailand Elections

Anti-government protesters have dismissed Sunday's snap elections in Thailand and vow to continue mass street protests to topple the caretaker government of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra.

The main opposition Democrat Party boycotted the elections, and protesters obstructed voting by blocking the distribution of ballots and preventing voters from entering polling stations in scores of constituencies.

The caretaker government has said it will hold a second round of polls for about 10 percent of people who were not able to vote Sunday. However, the Election Commission said Monday it cannot schedule a make-up election until the protests end.

Protesters said Monday they have no intention of leaving the streets and will fight to annul the election on several levels, including a legal requirement that an election take place in one day.

In the meantime, protesters are dismantling some of their camps to consolidate their numbers at other sites.

Results from the vote are not expected for weeks, with the winning party unable to form a new government until polls are held in the disrupted districts.

The Seattle Seahawks trounced the Denver Broncos 43-8 Sunday in the 48th annual American football Super Bowl held in MetLife stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

The Seahawks' vaunted defense completely dominated Denver's equally celebrated offense, led by future Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning.

The loss marred a history-making regular season for Manning, who earned his fifth career National Football League Most Valuable Player just one day earlier.

Seattle Linebacker Smith was named the game's Most Valuable Player.
