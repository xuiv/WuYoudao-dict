**中国：安倍将日本引向危险道路**


中国常驻联合国代表刘结一对日本进行抨击，指责安倍晋三首相参拜靖国神社，把日本引向一条“非常危险的”道路。

刘结一星期三晚间对记者说，安倍晋三参拜位于东京的靖国神社，实际上是与战犯们站在了一边。他表示，靖国神社“粉饰和美化”侵略行为。

刘结一敦促国际社会发出警告，要求安倍“必须纠正其错误的历史观，必须改正错误，绝不能在错误道路上走得更远”。

日本常驻联合国代表吉川元伟对此做出回应说，安倍参拜靖国神社并非向战犯致敬或赞扬军国主义，而是向日本的战争死难者表示敬意。

吉川元伟还重申了安倍晋三有关与中国方面就这一问题进行直接对话的提议，中国已经拒绝了安倍的建议。中日两国关系日趋紧张，安倍参拜靖国神社是导致中日关系恶化的最新因素。

China: Abe Taking Japan Down “Very Dangerous Path”


China's United Nations envoy has lashed out at Japan, accusing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of taking the country down a "very dangerous path" by visiting a controversial war shrine.

Liu Jieyi told reporters late Wednesday Mr. Abe was in effect "siding with war criminals" by visiting Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine, which he said "whitewashes and glorifies aggression."

He called on the international community to issue a warning that Mr. Abe "must correct his erroneous outlook of history, he must correct his mistakes and he must not slip further down the wrong path."

In response, Japan's U.N. Ambassador Motohide Yoshikawa said Mr. Abe's visit was not to pay homage to war criminals or praise militarism, but was to pay respects to Japan's war dead.

He also renewed the prime minister's call for direct talks with China over the issue, which is the latest irritant in the increasingly tense China-Japan relationship. China has rejected the proposal.

**罗德曼为评论被囚朝鲜的美国传道士道歉**

退役美国篮球明星罗德曼对自己一段充满脏话的议论表示歉意，他在发表这番议论时看起来是在指责一位被平壤拘押的美国公民。罗德曼目前在朝鲜，他自称这是一次“篮球外交”之旅。

罗德曼星期四通过公关人士发表声明说，他为自己的这番讨论负“全部责任”，并说这番评论“使很多人感到难堪”。罗德曼表示，那是压力很大的一天，他在接受美国有线电视新闻网即时采访之前一直在喝酒。

在星期二接受采访时，现年52岁的罗德曼看来在暗示被朝鲜当局判处15年监禁的韩裔美国传教士裴俊浩是罪有应得。罗德曼一边吸雪茄，一边问美国有线电视新闻网主持人：“你了解他在这个国家的所作所为吗？”

罗德曼的评论招致广泛批评。裴俊浩的母亲对美国之音说，她对罗德曼的评论感到失望，并说罗德曼应当为争取裴俊浩获释做出更大努力。

Rodman Apologizes for Comments on US Citizen Held in NKorea


Retired American basketball star Dennis Rodman, who is on a self-described "basketball diplomacy" trip to North Korea, has apologized for an incoherent, profanity-filled rant in which he appeared to blame a U.S. citizen for being held by Pyongyang.

In a statement through a publicist, Rodman said Thursday he takes "full responsibility" for his comments, which he said "embarrassed a lot of people." He said it had been a "stressful day" and he had been drinking before the live interview with CNN.

In the Tuesday interview, the 52-year-old Rodman seemed to imply Korean-American missionary Kenneth Bae deserved his sentence of 15 years hard labor in the North. Puffing a cigar, Rodman asked the CNN anchor, "Do you understand what he did in this country?"

The comments received widespread criticism. His mother, Myunghee Bae, told VOA ((Korean service)) she was "very disappointed" by Rodman's statement and said he should do more to push for his release.
