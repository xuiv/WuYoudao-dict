**奥巴马将签署命令 禁止歧视同性恋和变性者雇员**

奥巴马总统星期一将签署两个行政命令，禁止歧视同性恋和变性者政府雇员。

奥巴马总统上个月宣布打算签署有关行政命令，他说， 美国人上班时还要担心由于“率性而为”而被解雇。这是错误和令人不安的。

奥巴马一直推动国会通过更全面的法案，不仅保护联邦政府雇员也保护全国各地的工人，但有关草案遭到搁置。

白宫官员说，总统星期一签署的行政命令将影响到2万4千家公司的2800万雇员，大约占美国劳动力的五分之一。

Obama to Sign Orders Barring Discrimination against Gay, Transgender Workers

U.S. President Barack Obama is due to sign two executive orders Monday to prohibit discrimination against gay and transgender government workers.

Mr. Obama announced his plans for the orders last month, saying it is "upsetting" and "wrong" that Americans could go to work fearing they could be fired for being themselves.

The president has been pushing Congress to issue a more sweeping law to apply to workers across the United States, not just those working for the federal government, but that legislation has stalled.

White House officials say the orders Monday will impact 24,000 companies that employ 28 million workers, or about one-fifth of the U.S. workforce.

**乌克兰总理提出将调查线索交给荷兰**

乌克兰总理亚采纽克提出将调查马航失事客机的线索交给在这次灾难中损失最为惨重的荷兰。

亚采纽克星期一在一个记者会上还对亲俄分离分子击落民航客机表示愤慨，并认为莫斯科不能摆脱嫌疑。

与此同时，三名荷兰调查员小组抵达飞机坠毁现场。小组负责人说，事故发生四天之后，遇难者遗体看上去得到了妥善保管。

联合国安理会星期天晚上在纽约联合国总部开会，考虑提出一项决议。安理会星期一下午可能就这项协议进行表决，要求允许国际调查人员进入坠机现场。

澳大利亚总理阿伯特派外长毕晓普前往纽约，牵头推动通过决议。至少37名澳大利亚公民和永久居民在这次坠机事件中遇难。毕晓普要求停止把遇难者的遗体作为乌克兰-俄罗斯冲突中的人质或棋子。

俄罗斯总统普京星期一再次表示，假如乌克兰上个月没有再次与东乌克兰分离分子发生战斗，就不会发生这次客机坠毁事故。分离分子现在控制着坠机现场。

普京现在面临国际社会越来越大的压力，要求他说服乌克兰反政府武装，允许国际检查员进入现场展开调查。

普京星期一说，俄罗斯正在尽一切努力，让联合国国际民航组织专家小组前往事故现场。

俄罗斯驻联合国大使丘尔金说，俄罗斯不能支持联合国决议目前的文本，因为决议中没有写明由联合国民航组织牵头调查。

英国驻联合国大使格兰特指出，俄罗斯在使用“典型的俄式拖延战术”。

格兰特说，澳大利亚把俄罗斯的一条修改意见融入了决议，但俄罗斯现在又认为修正版本不可接受。格兰特说，“人们能猜出他们为什么要拖延。”

Ukraine PM Offers Plane Crash Lead Investigation to Netherlands

Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk has offered to turn over the lead in the investigation into the downing of a Malaysian airliner to the Netherlands - the country that suffered the most losses in the disaster.

At a news briefing Monday in Kyiv, Mr. Yatsenyuk also expressed outrage at the pro-Russian separatists whom he blames for shooting the plane out of the sky. He also said Moscow is on "the dark side"

Meanwhile, three Dutch investigators have arrived on the scene of the crash. The head of the team said the storage of the victims' bodies appears to be "of good quality" four days after the crash.

The U.N. Security Council could vote Monday (afternoon) on a resolution demanding international access to the crash site. The Security Council met late Sunday in the New York headquarters to consider a resolution.

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott dispatched Foreign Minister Julie Bishop to the U.S. to lead the lobbying effort for the resolution. Australia lost at least 37 citizens and residents in the crash.

Foreign Minister Bishop says it is time to stop using the plane victims' "bodies as hostages or pawns in a Ukrainian-Russian conflict."

Russian President Vladimir Putin once again on Monday said the downing of the airliner would not have happened if Ukraine had not re-ignited fighting last month in the region with separatists who now control the crash site.

Mr. Putin is under increasing international pressure to rein in the rebels in Ukraine to allow international inspectors to investigate the site.

He said Monday that Russia is doing everything possible to allow a team of experts from the U.N. International Civil Aviation Organization to investigate the scene.

Russia's U.N. ambassador Vitaly Churkin says Russia cannot support the U.N. resolution as currently written because it is not clear the U.N.'s Aviation Organization will lead the investigation.

The British ambassador to the U.N. said Russia is engaging in "typical Russian delaying tactics."

Mark Lyall Grant said Australia incorporated a Russian amendment into the resolution, but Russia now finds the amendment unacceptable. Grant said "one can guess why they want delay."
