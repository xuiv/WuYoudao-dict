**China, Vietnam Take Sea Dispute to UN Chief**

China and Vietnam, which are involved in a tense standoff in the South China Sea, are pleading their case to U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.

Beijing on Monday sent a paper to the U.N. chief, accusing Vietnam of "illegally and forcefully" disrupting Chinese oil drilling in waters claimed by both nations.

In the letter, China's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Wang Min said Vietnam was violating China's sovereignty and posing a "grave threat" to Chinese workers.

Vietnam later said it sent its own letter to Mr. Ban, demanding Beijing immediately withdraw the oil rig and all other ships, which it said violate Hanoi's sovereignty.

Hanoi also called on China to "create conditions" for talks on measures "to stabilize the situation and control the maritime issues between the two countries."

**South Korea Ferry Crew Members Stand Trial**

Nearly two months after South Korea's ferry disaster killed over 300 people, the captain and crew who abandoned the ship are standing trial on charges including murder.

Ferry captain Lee Joon-seok and three crew members are charged with "homicide through willful negligence" and face a possible death sentence. Eleven other crew members face lesser negligence charges.

The defendants appeared Tuesday before a court in Gwangju. The southwest city is not far from where the Sewol ferry sunk, killing mostly high school students who were headed to a nearby resort island.

Dozens of mourning parents and family members attended the hearing. Some scuffled with court officials before the proceedings. One relative held a sign that said, "You are not human, you are beneath animals."
