**人权组织要求调查以色列杀害平民案**

人权组织国际特赦呼吁对以色列在加沙地带50天战争中的军事行为进行调查。

国际特赦在星期三公布的报告中说，以色列对有人居住的房屋“实施了次数空前的攻击”，导致“令人震惊”程度的死亡和破坏。

以色列与哈马斯今年7月和8月的交战造成加沙2100多名巴勒斯坦人死亡，其中大多数是平民，还有67名以色列军人和六名平民死亡。

国际特赦的报告说，双方都犯下严重侵犯人权的罪行，但报告主要涉及以色列对加沙有人居住建筑物的轰炸。报告说，以色列没有采取必要的预防措施，确保攻击不会伤及平民。

国际特赦中东北非主任菲利普•卢瑟说，以色列军队对他们造成的破坏冷酷无情，对没有参与战斗的巴勒斯坦人表现得“令人震惊的漠视”。

以色列没有对此发表评论。


Amnesty Urges Investigation of 'Unprecedented' Israeli Attacks in Gaza

Rights group Amnesty International is calling for an investigation into the Israeli military's actions during its 50-day war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

In a new report Wednesday, Amnesty says Israel carried out an "unprecedented number of attacks on inhabited homes," causing an "appalling" scale of death and destruction.

The fighting in July and August killed more than 2,100 Palestinians in Gaza, most of them civilians, along with 67 Israeli soldiers and six civilians.

Amnesty's report cites both sides for committing serious human rights violations, but focuses on Israeli bombings of occupied buildings in Gaza. It says Israel did not take necessary precautions to ensure the attacks would not harm civilians.

Phillip Luther, Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa director, said Israeli forces showed "callous indifference" for the destruction they caused along with a "shocking disregard" for Palestinians not involved in the fighting.

Israel has not responded to the report.

West African Leaders Press for Transition in Burkina Faso

Three West African leaders are in Burkina Faso to push army leaders to honor their pledge to hand over power to a civilian transitional government.

Ghana's President John Mahama, Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan and Senegalese President Macky Sall arrived in the capital, Ouagadougou, on Wednesday.

The presidents are expected to meet with Burkina Faso's interim leader, Lieutenant Colonel Isaac Zida, as well as leaders of the opposition.

The military took control Friday after president Blaise Compaore resigned and fled to neighboring Ivory Coast.

Ivorian President Alassane Ouattara said Tuesday that Mr. Compaore is in "good spirits" and can stay as long as he wants.

The military appointed Lieutenant Colonel Isaac Zida as an interim leader, and he has said several times he would quickly transfer power.

On Monday, the African Union warned that Burkina Faso faces possible sanctions unless a civilian government takes power within two weeks.
An attempt to extend his rule ended in failure last week when protesters burned parliament, hours before lawmakers were due to vote on a measure eliminating term limits.
