Israeli Lawmakers Set March 17 Parliamentary Election

Israeli lawmakers have agreed to hold new elections on March 17 after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would dissolve the current parliament "as soon as possible."

Party officials decided on the date Wednesday, a day after Mr. Netanyahu fired two key ministers and called for early elections.

The parliament was due to begin the process of dissolving itself Wednesday in order to pave way for the March vote.

Opinion polls indicate that Mr. Netanyahu's party would likely retain power, allowing him to remain in office.

He said Tuesday that he wanted a "clear mandate" to carry out his policies, and that he would "no longer tolerate an opposition inside the government."


**印度加速实施潜艇现代化计划**

由于担忧中国海军在印度洋扩展势力，印度正在努力推动本国潜艇现代化进程。

印度总理莫迪的政府加快了六艘新柴电动力潜艇的竞标进程。此外，一家法国公司正在孟买建造六艘类似的潜艇。

数月前，印度和中国在喜马拉雅地区有争议的边界一带发生对峙，同时中国潜艇在斯里兰卡停泊。岛国斯里兰卡与印度南部海岸隔海相望。
印度向斯里兰卡表示，无法接受中国海军的存在。

中国坚持说，潜艇是在印度洋和亚丁湾执行打击海盗任务时停泊加油，但这种说法并未减轻印度方面的忧虑。

India Expedites Submarine Modernization Plans

India is moving ahead with efforts to modernize its submarine fleet amid concerns over China's growing naval presence in the Indian Ocean.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government accelerated the bidding process for six new diesel-electric submarines. These are in addition to six similar submarines under construction by a French company in Mumbai.

The push comes just months after a stand-off along the disputed border dividing India and China in the Himalayas, and as Chinese submarines have docked in Sri Lanka, the island nation off India's southern coast.

India told Sri Lanka that the Chinese presence there was unacceptable to New Delhi.

Beijing insisted the submarines were on refueling stops during anti piracy missions in the Indian Ocean and Gulf of Aden. This did not allay concerns in New Delhi.
