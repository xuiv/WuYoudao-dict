ISS Crew Returns Safely to Earth

Two Russians and an American are back on Earth after nearly six months aboard the International Space Station.

A Russian Soyuz capsule carrying Oleg Artemiev, Alexander Skvortsov and Steven Swanson parachuted safely onto the steppe of Kazakhstan early Thursday morning, several hours after ending a nearly six-month mission aboard the ISS.

They have been replaced by a new three-person crew, including Russian cosmonaut Max Suraev, American Reid Wiseman and Germany's Alexander Gerst, a member of the European Space Agency.

Another three-person crew is scheduled to arrive at the orbital outpost later this month. The crew will include Elena Serova, who will be the fourth Russian woman to fly in space and the first since 1997.


**国际特赦：泰国军政府奉行压制政策**

国际特赦组织指责泰国军方在发动政变夺取政权后的100天里奉行令人不安的压制政策。

国际特赦星期三列举了泰国军政府数百起任意拘留、实施酷刑以及广泛地限制言论和集会自由的案例。

总部设在伦敦的国际特赦说，泰国军政府试图扼杀不同政见。泰国军政府的正式名称是“全国和平与秩序委员会”。

泰国军方5月发动政变，此前英拉总理被法院免职，巴育将军继任总理。这是泰国军方在以往80年期间的第12次政变。

Thai Military Accused of 'Disturbing' Repression Since Coup

A leading human rights group is accusing Thailand's military of leading a "disturbing pattern of repression" in the 100 days since it seized power in a coup.

Amnesty International detailed Thursday what it says are hundreds of arbitrary detentions, reports of torture, and sweeping restrictions on freedom of speech and assembly.

The London-based group says the Thai military government, called the National Council for Peace and Order, is trying to "adjust attitudes" and "stifle dissent."

The military seized power in May after Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra was removed by a court order. General Prayuth Chan-ocha took her place as prime minister. It is the military's 12th coup in the last 80 years.
