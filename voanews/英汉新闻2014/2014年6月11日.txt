**美国众议院多数党领袖坎托初选落败**

星期二，争取连任众议员的的美国国会众议院多数党领袖、共和党人坎托在维吉尼亚州初选中出人意外地落败。

坎托被一所大学的经济学教授布拉特以压倒优势击败。布拉特得到极端保守的茶党运动的支持。

布拉特只筹到有限的竞选资金，但他指责坎托支持一项使美国境内非法移民轻易得到公民身份的计划，因此获得了选民以及媒体保守派人士的支持。这项计划的反对者批评说，该计划等于对非法移民实行“大赦”。

很多政治观察人士说，坎托的败选使得通过美国移民制度改革法案的希望归于破灭。
坎托星期二晚上对支持者发表讲话，表示对败选感到失望。但他强调，他相信每个人未来都有机会。

**House Majority Leader Cantor Loses Republican Primary to Tea Party Candidate **
U.S. Representative Eric Cantor, the majority leader of the Republican-controlled House, suffered a shocking defeat in a primary race for re-election to his congressional seat in Virginia Tuesday.

Cantor was soundly beaten by David Brat, an economics professor at a small college who was backed by the ultraconservative Tea Party movement.

Brat raised little money, but gained support from both voters and conservative media personalities by accusing Cantor of supporting a plan to grant illegal immigrants in the U.S. an easy path to citizenship, which opponents have criticized as an "amnesty."

Many political observers say Cantor's upset loss has scuttled any chance of passing legislation to reform the nation's immigration system.

Addressing his supporters Tuesday night, Cantor called his loss "disappointing" but stressed that he believes "there's opportunity around the next corner for all of us."

**South Korea Police Raid Compound in Search for Fugitive Businessman**

Thousands of South Korean police raided a religious compound Wednesday in their search for a businessman wanted in connection with an April ferry sinking that killed over 300 people.

Yoo Byung-un is the head of a family that runs the Chonghaejin Marine Company, which owned and operated the Sewol ferry. The 72-year-old, who has evaded a nationwide manhunt for almost a month, is wanted on embezzlement, negligence, and tax evasion charges.

About 6,000 police officers, many in riot gear, stormed a large religious complex belonging to the Evangelical Baptist Church, where Yoo was a co-founder. After a brief standoff, police entered the facility, which is about 80 kilometers south of Seoul.

President Park Geun-hye, whose government has been criticized for its response to the ferry disaster, on Tuesday told her cabinet that Yoo must be brought to justice. Investigators are also determining whether lax safety standards and poor maintenance led to the disaster.
