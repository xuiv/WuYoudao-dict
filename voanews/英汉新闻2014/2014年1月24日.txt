**许志永新公民运动案周日宣判**

中国持不同政见者许志永的律师表示，他星期三出席庭审的法庭将在星期日上午宣布判决结果。

许志永被控“聚众扰乱公共场所秩序”。他在法庭保持沉默，在审判中没有为自己辩护。如果罪名成立，他可能面临五年徒刑。

40岁的许志永是一名法律学者。他创立了草根性的新公民运动。新公民运动支持民主和法治，并把打击腐败官员作为目标。

共有七位新公民运动成员于本周和下周受审。另外三名成员去年12月接受了审判，他们的案子还没有宣布判决结果。

美国国务院批评了这次镇压。这引起北京愤怒的反应。星期二，中国外交部说，外国不该干涉中国的内部事务。

Chinese Dissident Verdict Expected Sunday

The lawyer for Chinese dissident Xu Zhiyong, who went on trial on Wednesday, says the verdict will be announced Sunday morning.

Xu was charged with "gathering crowds to disrupt public order." He stayed silent and did not defend himself at his trial and, if found guilty, could face five years in prison.

Xu, a 40-year-old legal scholar, founded the grassroots New Citizens Movement, which supports democracy and the rule of law and has a goal of crackdown on corrupt officials.

A total of seven New Citizens Movement members are standing trial this week and next. Three others were tried in December, though verdicts have not been delivered.

The U.S. State Department has criticized the crackdown, prompting an angry reaction from Beijing. On Tuesday, China's Foreign Ministry said foreign countries should not interfere with its internal issues.

**朝鲜致函韩国敦促结束军事行为**


朝鲜国防委员会给韩国官员发出一封公开信，称平壤“决意创造和解与团结的气氛”。

朝鲜官方的朝中社周五刊登了这封公开信。公开信还誓言要致力于“完全停止敌对军事行动，实现离散家庭的团聚，并重新激励多方面的南北合作与交流。

然而，公开信呼吁终止韩国与美国的联合军事演习，同时为其所谓的“用于自卫的宝贵核力量”辩护。

上周， 朝鲜国防委员会发出了一系列提议，敦促韩国取消预定的美韩联合演习。首尔将上述呼吁斥为欺骗性的宣传活动。

North Korea Urges End to Military Acts in Letter to South Korea

North Korea's National Defense Commission has sent an open letter to South Korean officials saying Pyongyang is "determined to create an atmosphere of reconciliation and unity."

The North's official Korean Central News Agency carried the letter on Friday, which also vowed to work to "completely halt hostile military acts, realize the reunion of separated families and re-energize multi-faceted North-South cooperation and exchanges.

However, the letter called for an end to South Korea's joint military drills with the United States, while defending what it called its own "precious nuclear force for self-defense”.

Last week, the NDC sent a series of proposals urging South Korea to cancel schedule joint exercises with the U.S. Seoul dismissed the calls as deceptive propaganda exercises.
