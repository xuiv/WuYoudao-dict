**克里：俄罗斯使叙利亚能够寻求诉诸武力**

美国国务卿克里说，叙利亚政府试图取得对反对派的军事胜利，而俄罗斯则在为叙利亚总统阿萨德提供这种能力。

克里星期一在雅加达说，叙利亚继续炮轰平民的行动证实了其战略意图，而俄罗斯向叙利亚运送武器和援助则是在帮助阿萨德通过武力、而不是政治方式来结束内战。

随同克里出访的美国之音记者斯特恩斯说，克里希望国际社会利用和谈间歇找到达成叙利亚政治解决方案的最佳途径。

俄罗斯是阿萨德的盟友，同时又与美国一道促成叙利亚双方进行和谈。

Kerry: Russia Enabling Syria's Pursuit of Military Path

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry says the Syrian government is trying to win a military victory over the opposition, and that Russia is enabling President Bashar al-Assad on that path.

Speaking Monday in Jakarta, Kerry said Syria's strategy is evident in its continuing barrel bombing of civilians, and that Russia's deliveries of arms and aid are helping Mr. Assad's pursuit of a military solution over a political end to the civil war.

VOA correspondent Scott Stearns, who is traveling with Kerry, said the secretary wants the international community to use a break in the talks to figure out how best to pursue a political solution.

Russia has been both an ally of Mr. Assad and, along with the United States, a lead player in bringing the Syrian sides together for the peace talks.

**美国庆祝总统节**

美国工人和学生星期一将放假一天，庆祝每年一度的总统日。
1879年，为纪念美国首任总统乔治·华盛顿的诞辰而将2月22日设为联邦假日。将近一个世纪后，美国国会于1968年通过一项法律，不再将几位总统的诞辰作为假日，而把星期一定为联邦假日，让美国工人们得以连续休息三天。
总统日设在每年2月的第三个星期一，零售商们在这一天减价促销商品。

US Celebrates Presidents' Day Holiday

Millions of workers and school children in the United States are getting a day off Monday for the annual Presidents' Day holiday.

It first became a federal holiday in 1879 to celebrate the February 22 birthday of the first U.S. president, George Washington.

Nearly a century later, in 1968, Congress passed a law shifting the celebration of several federal holidays from specific dates to predetermined Mondays in order to give workers three consecutive days off.

Retailers take advantage of the holiday - held on the third Monday in February - to promote sales and price cuts on their products.
