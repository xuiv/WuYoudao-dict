**马来西亚反对派人士被控煽动暴乱**

一位马来西亚政界人士被控煽动暴乱，证据是他指责政府帮助判定反对党领袖安瓦尔犯有鸡奸罪。

苏仁德是安瓦尔的律师，他是当局依照煽动暴乱法起诉的又一位反对派政界人士。人权组织认为这项法律是压制性的。

苏仁德4月说，纳吉布总理以阴谋手段将安瓦尔送入监狱。在此一个月前，安瓦尔被判定曾鸡奸一名年轻男助手。

安瓦尔是纳吉布的主要对手。他表示，鸡奸指控是政府捏造的。这个政府连续执政已经57年。

安瓦尔曾担任马来西亚副总理。他说，他的律师有权评论政府参与他的案件的情况。

人权观察指责马来西亚当局控告苏仁德煽动暴乱。该组织发表声明说，这一举动再次显示马来西亚当局利用严酷法律来侵犯言论自由和压制批评人士。

人权观察说，纳吉布2012年曾保证废除煽动暴乱法，但现在暴露出他只是在用空话欺骗马来西亚民众和国际社会。

Malaysian Opposition Politician Charged With Sedition

A Malaysian politician has been charged with sedition for accusing the government of helping plot the sodomy conviction against opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim.

N. Surendran, who is one of Anwar's lawyers, is the latest opposition politician to be charged under the Sedition Act, which rights groups say is oppressive.

Surendran said in an April that Prime Minister Najib Razak had conspired to help jail Anwar, who was convicted a month earlier of sodomizing a young male aide.

Anwar, who is Mr. Najib's chief rival, says the sodomy charges were made up by the government, which has been in power for the last 57 years.

The ex-deputy prime minister, who is free on appeal, says his lawyer has the right to speak about the government's alleged involvement in his case.

Human Rights Watch slammed the sedition charge. In a statement, the group said the move is "another blatant example of a draconian law being used to violate freedom of expression and silence critics."

It said Prime Minister Najib's 2012 pledge to scrap the law now has been exposed as "hollow rhetoric designed to deceive both Malaysians and the international community."

**美警察与抗议者在弗格森镇再起冲突**

星期一晚间，抗议者和警察在美国中部密苏里州弗格森镇再次爆发冲突。在弗格森镇，一名白人警官打死一名手无寸铁的黑人少年造成了紧张局势。

佩戴防暴护具的警察向聚集在弗格森镇街头的抗议者发射震爆弹和催泪弹。抗议者最初进行和平抗议，后来局势陷于混乱。有人向全副武装的警察投掷燃烧弹和瓶子。

警官约翰逊上尉星期二清晨对记者说，警察遭到猛烈攻击，但未放一枪。他表示，抗议者人群中有人开枪，打伤了两人。看来很多抗议者不服从警方的命令，拒绝离开。约翰逊说，逮捕了31人。

约翰逊表示，大多数抗议者是和平的，但一小部分人把示威活动变成暴力。他说，警察不会把“罪犯“与弗格森居民混为一谈。

国民警卫队员在抗议者集会地点附近巡逻。连续几天发生暴力抗议活动后，国民警卫队按照密苏里州长尼克松的请求于星期一清晨进驻弗格森镇，加强当地的警力。

在18岁黑人青年迈克尔•布朗8月9日被当地一名警察开枪打死的街道附近，警察和抗议者继续对峙。

Protesters, Police Clash in Ferguson, Missouri Following Black Teen's Death

Protesters and police engaged in fresh overnight clashes in the central U.S. town of Ferguson, Missouri, amid tensions linked to the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager by a white police officer.

Police in riot gear fired stun grenades and tear gas at protesters who gathered on the streets of Ferguson, which had descended into chaos following peaceful protests. "Molotov cocktails" and bottles were thrown in the direction of heavily armored police.

A police official, Captain Ron Johnson, told reporters early Tuesday that police came under heavy attack but did not fire a shot. He said two people were wounded by shots fired from within the crowd of protesters. Many protesters seemed to be defying orders from police to disperse, and Johnson said 31 people were arrested.

He noted that most of the protesters were peaceful, but that a small minority of people turned the demonstrations violent. He said officials will not let "criminals" define the community of Ferguson.

National Guard troops could be seen on the fringes of the gathering. Those troops arrived in Ferguson earlier Monday at the request of Missouri Governor Jay Nixon to bolster police forces following days of violent protests.

The standoff occurred near the street where 18-year-old Michael Brown was fatally shot by a local police officer on August 9.
