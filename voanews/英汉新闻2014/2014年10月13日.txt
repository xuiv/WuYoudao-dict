Vongfong Brings Heavy Rain to Mainland Japan

Heavy rain has spread to Japan's main islands as a storm that first hit as powerful Typhoon Vongfong continued its path across the country.

Japan's Meteorological Agency said Vongfong still had winds of up to 160 kilometers per hour Monday after being downgraded to a tropical storm. Forecasters expect it to hit the Tokyo area by early Tuesday. More than 500 flights have been canceled.

The storm peaked with winds of 234 kilometers per hour Saturday, and has damaged homes and caused transportation delays as it crossed over Japan's southern Islands.

It has injured at least 56 people and authorities have urged 450,000 people to evacuate.

Vongfong is the second typhoon to hit Japan in the past week, after Typhoon Phanfone killed seven people, including three U.S. servicemen.
