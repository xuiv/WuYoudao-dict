**香港居民要求中国给予全面民主**

香港数千人参加了每年一度的新年抗议示威，要求北京当局允许港人自由选举香港特首。

香港警方估计有6千多人从香港维多利亚公园集合出发。组织者则认为有1万多人参加了游行。

北京承诺2017年香港实行普选，但很多香港人担心北京当局可能不会遵守承诺，让港人自由选举。

参加游行的崔先生（译音）对北京当局自香港1997年归回以来不断干预香港事务表示不满。

他说，他参加抗议是因为我们的历届特首都很糟糕， 因为他们是北京任命的，如果我们能够选举自己的特首就会好些。

香港特首任期五年，由北京中央政府任命的1200人的选举委员会选出，该委员会主要由亲北京人士组成。

现任特首梁振英的政府不断爆出腐败丑闻，其任期到2017年结束。有些抗议人士担心北京在选举规则上做手脚，阻止亲民主的候选人竞选特首，接替梁振英。

有些活动人士说，如果不能保证公平的选举制度，他们今年晚些时候将占领香港主要商业区。

香港不断有抗议活动，港人对高房价以及大陆居民大批进入香港耗用当地人力物力资源感到愤怒。

不过香港享有高度的自治，港人也能够行使中国大陆民众得不到的一些政治权利。

Hong Kong Residents Demand 'Full Democracy' from China

Thousands of Hong Kong residents have joined an annual New Year's Day march to demand China allow them to elect their own leaders.

Police estimated over 6,000 people set off on the march Wednesday from Victoria Park, but organizers said over 10,000 participated.

The semi-autonomous Chinese city is set to hold elections in 2017, but many fear Beijing will go back on its promise to allow a free vote.

Peter Tsui, one of the marchers, expressed frustration over the mainland's interference in the ex-British colony, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997.

Currently, Hong Hong chief executives are selected to five-year terms by a 1,200-member committee dominated by pro-China appointees.

Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, whose government has been plagued by corruption scandals, is scheduled to finish his term in 2017.

Some of the protesters fear Beijing will influence election rules to block pro-democracy candidates from running to replace him.

If a fair electoral system is not guaranteed, some activists say they plan to take over the streets of Hong Kong's business district later this year.

The city has seen regular protests, amid public anger about high property prices and a growing influx of mainland Chinese using the city's resources.

But Hong Kong does enjoy a high degree of autonomy and its citizens are able to exercise political rights not allowed on the mainland.

**南苏丹政府将与叛军举行停战谈判**

南苏丹总统基尔和反政府武装领导人马查尔双方的代表正在埃塞尔比亚集合，准备举行和平会谈，争取结束南苏丹暴力。暴力已经导致一千多人丧生。

在双方准备会晤之际，南苏丹的战斗仍在持续。有关官员星期三说，在距离首都朱巴大约120公里的博尔，政府军和忠于马查尔的部队重新爆发冲突。

星期二，反政府武装重新攻占了博尔。上星期，他们曾短暂占领这座重镇，后来被政府军赶走。

南苏丹是世界最新成立的国家。南苏丹的流血冲突在12月中旬开始，当时，总统基尔指责他的前副总统马查尔企图政变。

总统基尔和马查尔都表示一定会参与在埃塞尔比亚首都亚的斯亚贝巴举行的和谈。和谈是由东非地区集团“政府间发展组织”（IGAD）从中斡旋的。

South Sudan Government, Rebels to Hold Talks to End Violence


Delegates for South Sudan's President Salva Kiir and rebel leader Riek Machar are gathering in Ethiopia for peace talks, in a bid to end violence that has left more than 1,000 people dead.

Fighting continues in South Sudan as the sides prepare to meet. Officials said Wednesday there were renewed clashes between government troops and forces loyal to Machar in Bor, a town about 120 kilometers from the capital, Juba.

On Tuesday, rebels recaptured Bor, a key city they had briefly held before being ousted by government forces last week.

The bloodshed in the world's newest country began in mid-December when Mr. Kiir accused his former vice president Machar of attempting a coup.

President Kiir and Machar have both committed to the peace talks in Addis Ababa, which are being brokered by IGAD ((the Intergovernmental Authority on Development)), an East African regional bloc.
