**巴西举行总统选举**

巴西选民纷纷前往投票站，参加该国几十年来角逐最激烈的总统选举投票。

民调显示，决选中左翼现任总统迪尔马•罗塞夫稍微领先其对手，中间偏右的参议员阿埃西奧•內維斯。

星期天的投票被广泛认为是对工人党执政十二年的一次全民公投，该党因扩大社会福利计划使数百万人脱贫进入中产阶级而备受赞扬。

不过罗塞夫四年执政期间，经济增长差，衰退严重。她还面临大规模反贪抗议，以及有关世界杯开支问题的批评。

获得巴西财富精英阶层广泛支持的內維斯保证当选后将限制政府开支，同时继续实行工人党的社会计划。

Polls Open in Brazil's Presidential Election
Voters in Brazil are heading to the polls to vote in one of the country's most tightly contested presidential elections in decades.

Polls show leftist incumbent President Dilma Rousseff has a slight lead over her opponent, center-right senator Aecio Neves in the runoff election.

Sunday's vote is widely seen as a referendum on the Workers' Party's 12 years in power, which is credited with expanding social welfare programs and lifting millions out of poverty to the middle class.

However, Ms. Rousseff's last four years in office have been marked by poor economic growth and recession. She has also faced massive anti-corruption protests and criticism over spending on the World Cup.

Neves, who has wide support among Brazil's wealthy elite has promised to continue the Worker's Party's social program while reigning in government spending.


**美官员：隔离埃博拉志愿者会有副作用**

一名美国高级卫生官员警告说，如果把从西非埃博拉疫区工作归来的医务人员强行隔离，可能会使人们不愿意去那里做义工。

美国国家过敏与传染疾病研究所主任安东尼•福斯星期天对CNN电视台说，保护美国人的最佳途径是制止西非的疫情，而具体措施之一就是帮助去那里的医务人员，而不是采取打消积极性的做法。

在他说这番话之前，美国有三个州实行了新的检疫政策。纽约州、新泽西州和伊利诺伊州对所有从西非回来的、接触过埃博拉患者的人实行三个星期的强制隔离。

新泽西州州长克里斯•克里斯蒂为隔离政策辩护说，这是“保护新泽西人民公共健康”的必要措施。

另一方面，美国驻联合国大使鲍尔星期天抵达几内亚首都科纳克里，去评估全球应对西非疫情的情况。

鲍尔说，她希望更深入地了解还需要哪些资源，以便推动其他国家提供进一步帮助。

鲍尔稍后将从几内亚前往塞拉利昂和利比里亚。在将近五千个埃博拉死亡病例中，大多数发生在这三个国家。

US Doctor: Ebola Quarantine May Deter Volunteers

A top U.S. medical official has warned that mandatory quarantines of health care workers returning from Ebola-affected parts of West Africa could discourage people from volunteering in the region.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN's State of the Union program Sunday that the best way to protect Americans is to stop the outbreak in Africa, and one of the best ways to do that is to help health workers who go there, rather than take measures that may "disincentivize them from going."

His comments follow new quarantine policies being imposed by three U.S. states. New York, New Jersey and Illinois have imposed a mandatory three-week quarantine for anyone returning from West Africa who had exposure to Ebola patients.

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie defended his state's quarantine, calling it necessary "to protect the public health of the people of New Jersey."

Meanwhile Sunday, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, arrived in Guinea's capital Conakry as part of a mission to assess the global response to the epidemic in West Africa.

Power says she hopes to gain a better understanding of what resources are missing so she can push other countries to offer more help.

From Guinea, Power will visit Sierra Leone and Liberia. The three nations account for the majority of the nearly 5,000 deaths from the Ebola virus.
