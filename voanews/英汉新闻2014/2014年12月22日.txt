**澳大利亚法院对悉尼绑架者的伙伴撤销保释**

神经错乱的伊朗移民摩尼斯上周绑架人质造成2人死亡。澳大利亚一法院决定撤销对其伙伴的保释。

阿米拉赫•德洛蒂斯是绑架者曼•哈伦•摩尼斯的伙伴。摩尼斯上星期在悉尼一家咖啡厅绑架17名人质，将他们扣押了16个多小时。后来全副武装的警察冲进去，将他击毙，两名人质在绑架事件中死亡。

德洛蒂斯被控谋杀摩尼斯的前妻，但获得保释。美联社报道，摩尼斯的前妻被刺杀和点火焚烧。摩尼斯本人被控参与谋杀。他还面对四十多项性侵和猥亵指控。摩尼斯20年前逃到澳大利亚，声称在伊朗受到迫害。

Court Orders Partner Of Sydney Hostage-Taker Jailed

An Australian court has revoked the bail of the partner of a deranged Iranian-born man who last week carried out a deadly attack on a cafe in Sydney.

Amirah Droudis was the partner of Man Haron Monis, who was shot dead last week when a swarm of heavily armed police stormed the cafe where he held 17 hostages for more than 16 hours. Two hostages died in the incident.

Droudis had been free on bail after she was charged with the murder of Monis' ex-wife. The Associated Press reports Monis' wife was stabbed and set afire.

Monis was charged as an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife. He also faced more than 40 sexual assault and indecency charges.

He fled to Australia two decades ago claiming persecution in Iran.


**美国政府未能保护受虐待儿童**

美联社报道，在六年期间，美国至少786名儿童死于虐待和疏忽。这些儿童在“儿童保护机构的眼皮底下”死去。

美联社说，在历时八个月的调查中发现，儿童保护机构完全应该了解这些儿童死亡之前的处境危险，他们中的许多人“受到殴打、挨饿或者无人看护溺水身亡”。

美联社在美国的50个州以及哥伦比亚特区和美国军队多个部门做了这项调查。

调查报告显示，已知死亡的768个儿童中，绝大多数年龄在4岁以下。

美联社说，有关儿童死亡的数据收集系统存在缺陷，因此没有人能够确切地说出每年究竟有多少儿童死于虐待或者疏忽。

美国联邦政府估计，近些年平均每年有大约1650名儿童死于虐待和疏忽。美联社报道，许多人认为实际数字是这个数字的两倍。

Report: US Officials Fail to Protect Abused Children


The Associated Press says at least 786 children in the United States have died of abuse and neglect in a six-year span, saying the children died "in plain view of child protection authorities."

AP says it discovered during its eight-month investigation that many of the children were "beaten, starved or left alone to drown while agencies had good reason to know they were in danger."

AP conducted the survey in the 50 U.S. states, plus the District of Columbia and branches of the military. The report says many states "struggled to provide numbers" and that "secrecy often prevailed."

The survey revealed that most of the 768 children known to have died were under the age of four.

The data collection system on child deaths is so flawed, AP said, that no one can say for certain how many children overall die from abuse or neglect every year.

The federal government estimates an average of about 1,650 deaths annually in recent years. The Associated Press reports many believe the actual number is twice as high.
