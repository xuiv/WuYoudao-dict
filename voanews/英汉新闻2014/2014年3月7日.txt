**奥巴马与普京通话 提外交解决乌克兰危机方案**

美国总统奥巴马与俄罗斯总统普京就乌克兰危机进行了一小时电话交谈，双方几乎没有达成任何共同立场。

白宫说，奥巴马在星期四的电话交谈中向普京指出，俄罗斯军队在克里米亚半岛的存在侵犯了乌克兰的主权。

自俄罗斯军人上星期六出现在乌克兰克里米亚地区以来，据知这是美俄两国领导人的首次直接接触。

克里姆林宫星期五发表的声明援引普京的话说，受到西方支持的乌克兰新领导人是非法的，他们强迫“乌克兰东部和东南部地区以及克里米亚接受完全非法的决定”。

尽管普京强调俄美关系的绝对重要性，他同时表示“俄罗斯不能无视请求帮助的呼声，并且提供了帮助，这完全符合国际法”。

白宫说，奥巴马总统提出了几种旨在消除对峙状态的外交解决方案，这些方案照顾到“俄罗斯、乌克兰人民以及国际社会的利益”。

奥巴马敦促基辅和莫斯科在国际社会的斡旋下进行直接对话，并敦促俄罗斯军队全部撤回基地，由国际观察员确保包括俄罗斯族居民在内的所有乌克兰人的安全。

Obama Phones Putin on Ukraine, Offers Diplomatic Solutions

U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin found little common ground during an hour-long phone call to discuss the crisis in Ukraine.

During the call Thursday, the White House says President Obama told Mr. Putin the presence of Russian forces in the Crimean Peninsula is a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty.

It is the first known direct contact between the leaders since Russian military personnel appeared in the Ukrainian territory Saturday, following the ouster of Ukraine's Moscow-friendly leaders.

A Kremlin statement Friday quoted Mr. Putin as saying Ukraine's new Western-backed leaders are illegitimate and are dictating "absolutely illegitimate decisions to the eastern and southeastern regions of Ukraine and Crimea."

While Mr. Putin stressed the "paramount importance" of Russian-American relations, he said "Russia cannot ignore calls for help in this matter and it acts accordingly, in full compliance with international law."

The White House said Mr. Obama proposed several diplomatic solutions to the standoff, which it said address "the interests of Russia, the people of Ukraine and the international community."

As part of the solution, the president called for direct talks between Kyiv and Moscow that would be mediated by the international community. Mr. Obama also called for all Russian forces to return to their bases and for international monitors to ensure the safety of all Ukrainians, including ethnic Russians.
