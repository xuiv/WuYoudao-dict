**Ukrainian Rebels Free European Monitors**

Pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine have freed four European monitors who have been detained for a month. Four observers were freed a month after they were taken from Luhansk.

Four others seized in Donetsk were let go earlier in the week. OSCE officials say all are in good health. It is still not clear why they were taken.

The European Union is demanding the separatists and their supporters in Moscow take steps to de-escalate the crisis in eastern Ukraine or face more sanctions. Steps the EU demands include peace talks and letting the OSCE monitors do their jobs.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko Friday extended by three days a cease-fire with the rebels. Some of the rebels said they would observe a truce as long as the Ukrainian military does.
