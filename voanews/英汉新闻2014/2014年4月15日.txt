**无人潜艇将再次入海寻找失踪客机**

搜寻人员星期二将继续动用微型无人潜艇，在印度洋搜寻马航失踪客机。一天前，这艘潜艇首次作业时被迫提前浮出水面。

“蓝鳍21”号无人潜艇星期一夜间开始进行预订16个小时的海底搜索，寻找马航MH370号班机，但是这艘无人潜艇进行搜寻的海域深度超过了其4千5百米的设计极限，因此缩短了作业时间。美国官员说，内装安全系统令其浮出水面，潜艇没有受到破坏。

官员们说，他们正在对这艘潜艇在六个小时作业期间搜集的资料进行分析，目前还没有发现失踪飞机的迹象。

联合搜寻行动协调中心表示，这艘无人潜艇将根据气候状况，于星期二晚些时候重新部署作业行动。

声波定位仪最后一次探测到据信来自失踪客机黑匣子的信号是在近一个星期前。

黑匣子的定位信标发出信号，以便更容易被找到，但是黑匣子的电池寿命只有大约一个月，而马航客机失踪已近40天。

Robotic Sub Set to Dive Again in Search for Missing Plane

A robotic submarine is set to resume its search for the missing Malaysian jet in the Indian Ocean one day after aborting its first mission.

The unmanned Bluefin-21 submarine was deployed on Monday night to start what was supposed to be a 16-hour search of the seabed for the Malaysia Airlines MH370.

But the mission was cut short after the submarine entered an area that exceeded its operating depth limit of 4,500 meters. U.S. navy officials say its built-in safety feature returned it to the surface and that it was not damaged.

Officials say data collected from the sub's six hour mission was analyzed and showed no sign of the missing plane.

The Joint Agency Coordination Center (JACC), which is coordinating the search, said the vehicle will be redeployed later Tuesday depending on weather conditions.

The submarine is being sent down nearly a week after sound locating equipment last heard signals that are believed to be from the missing jet's black boxes.

Locator beacons on the plane's flight recorder boxes emit signals so they can be more easily found, but their batteries only last about a month. It has been nearly 40 days since the jet went missing.

**波士顿周二纪念马拉松爆炸案一周年**

美国副总统拜登星期二将与波士顿地方官员一道参加波士顿马拉松致命爆炸案一周年纪念仪式。

按照预定计划，拜登、波士顿市长沃尔什和麻萨诸塞州州长帕特里克将在纪念仪式上发表讲话。活动组织者说，在纪念仪式上将向包括死难者家属在内的爆炸案受害者以及医务人员致敬。

去年，两枚炸弹在马拉松赛终点附近爆炸，造成三人死亡，250多人受伤。

有关当局说，塔梅兰·萨纳耶夫和焦哈尔·萨纳耶夫兄弟用自制的高压锅炸弹制造了这起爆炸案。

爆炸案发生后，有关当局展开搜捕，塔梅兰·萨纳耶夫在波士顿郊区与警察交火时被击毙，焦哈尔·萨纳耶夫被逮捕。

焦哈尔·萨纳耶夫将于今年11月受审，他被控30项罪名，如被判罪名成立，他将面临死刑。

Biden to Speak at Boston Marathon Tribute

U.S. Vice President Joe Biden is joining local leaders in Boston on Tuesday for a ceremony marking the one-year anniversary of the deadly bombings at the Boston Marathon.

Biden is scheduled to speak at the event along with Boston Mayor Martin Walsh and Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick. Organizers say the tribute will honor those affected by the bombing, and include victims' families and medical staff.

Two bombs exploded near the marathon finish line last year, killing three people and wounding more than 250 others.

Authorities say brothers Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev carried out the attack using homemade pressure cooker bombs.

The blasts set off a multi-day manhunt that ended with Tamerlan Tsarnaev dead from a shootout with police and a bloody Dzhokhar being arrested in a Boston suburb.

Dzhokhar is due to go on trial in November on 30 federal charges and will face the death penalty.
