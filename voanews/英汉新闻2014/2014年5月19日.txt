**土耳其矿难后3人被起诉，22人被拘留**

土耳其当局正在调查上星期发生在土耳其西部的矿难。矿难导致301名矿工丧生。当局已经起诉3人，拘留了22人。

萨伊内尔检察官说，嫌疑人被控玩忽职守。此前，一项初步报告指出，发生事故的矿井违反了几项安全规定。

土耳其《国民报》援引获得的一份初步报告报道，这座煤矿存在多处安全违规，包括矿井内缺乏一氧化碳检测器和矿井顶部用木材而并非金属支撑。

这次矿难在土耳其全国各地引发抗议行动，抗议者指责政府和矿主无视工人安全。爆炸发生时，井下有近800名矿工。

矿井负责人否认有任何安全方面的疏失。

Turkish authorities charged three people and detained 22

Turkish authorities have charged three people and detained 22 others as part of an investigation into last week's deadly coal mine disaster in western Turkey that killed 301 miners.

Bekir Sahiner, the prosecutor, said: "Suspects are accused of, at this stage, negligence and contributing to the deaths of more than one person."

A preliminary report on the accident, obtained by Turkey's Milliyet newspaper, indicated several safety violations in the mine, including a shortage of carbon monoxide detectors and ceilings made of wood instead of metal.

The accident has triggered protests across Turkey aimed at the government and the mine owners who protesters say neglected safety. Nearly 800 miners were underground at the time of the blast.

Mine operator Soma Komur has denied any claim of negligence.

**巴尔干地区洪灾**

波黑、克罗地亚和塞尔维亚发生水灾，造成至少37人死亡，数万人流离失所。

灾区大部分地段星期一仍被水淹，救援和疏散工作正在继续进行。

为了躲避洪水，很多人挤在船上和军用卡车里。很多地区断电。

洪水引起两千多起滑坡，上世纪90年代初战争遗留的一些地雷露出地面。

俄罗斯的货运飞机和欧盟的直升机参加了救援行动。

专家说，这股高速气流使巴尔干正面地区陷于停顿。几天来的降雨相当于四个月的降水量。

罗马天主教皇方济各呼吁世界各国为巴尔干地区的水灾受害者祈祷。他在每周一次的梵蒂冈讲话中说，他对陷于困境的巴尔干灾民深感同情。

Floods Devastate Balkans

Floods in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia have killed at least 37 people and left tens of thousands homeless.

Much of the region remains under water Monday as rescue and evacuation efforts continue.

Many people have crammed into boats and army trucks to escape the water. Much of the region has no electricity.

The floods have caused more than 2,000 landslides and are uncovering mines left over from the Balkan wars of the early 1990s.

Russian cargo planes and helicopters from the European Union are helping with the relief efforts.

Experts say the jet stream stalled a huge front over the Balkans, dumping about four months' worth of rain in just a few days.

Pope Francis is asking the world to pray for victims of the worst flooding to hit the Balkans in more than a century. Francis told his weekly Sunday audience at the Vatican that he feels personal closeness to those living through pain and trouble.
