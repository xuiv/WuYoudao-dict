**土耳其警察与支持库尔德人冲突 12人死亡**

土耳其警察与支持库尔德人的示威者发生冲突，造成至少12人死亡。示威者要求政府帮助在邻国叙利亚的库尔德人与伊斯兰国激进分子作战。

星期二的死难者中八人死于土耳其南部库尔德城镇迪亚巴克尔，其他四人死于穆什、锡尔特和巴特曼。

土耳其议会上星期授权对在伊拉克和叙利亚的伊斯兰国激进分子动用武力，但土耳其军队没有越过边界进入叙利亚城市科巴尼。科巴尼又名艾因阿拉伯。

科巴尼的库尔德武装人员几个星期以来一直与攻打该镇的伊斯兰国激进分子作战。土耳其总统埃尔多安星期二表示，如果不采取地面行动科巴尼将很快落入伊斯兰国手中。

Clashes Between Pro-Kurdish Protesters, Police Kill 12 in Turkey

At least 12 people are dead in Turkey after clashes between police and pro-Kurdish protesters who want the government to help Kurds in neighboring Syria battle Islamic State militants.

Eight of the deaths Tuesday happened in the main Kurdish town of Diyabakir in southern Turkey, while others died in Mus, Siirt and Batman.

Turkey's parliament authorized the use of force against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria last week, but the military has not crossed the border to intervene in the Syrian city of Kobani, also known as Ayn al-Arab.

Kurdish fighters in Kobani have spent weeks battling the militants. Turkey's president said Tuesday the town may soon fall without ground action.


**“推特” 状告美国司法部**

国际微博平台“推特” 状告美国司法部和联邦调查局，要求有更多的权利发布政府监控其用户的信息。

推特是星期二在北加州法院提出的诉讼。根据现行法规，推特不能透露有关政府以国家安全理由要求用户数据的请求。

推特称，对言论自由权利的限制违反美国宪法第一修正案。该公司表示，它提起诉讼的目的是要迫使政府对个人信息请求变得更加透明。

微软、 谷歌、 脸书和Dropbox等美国大的科技公司一直反对政府有权要求他们提供用户私人数据。

美国政府已经表示，每年将公布用户国家安全数据请求的总数。但微软和谷歌认为，他们应该能够了解联邦政府对特定用户内容，例如电子邮件往来的请求频率。

US Twitter Lawsuit

International microblogging platform Twitter has sued the U.S. Justice Department and the FBI for the right to release more information about government surveillance of its users.

The lawsuit was filed Tuesday in a northern California court. Under current regulations, Twitter cannot reveal certain information about government requests for users' data relating to national security.

Twitter argues that the restrictions violate the right to free speech, as defined by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The firm said it filed the suit in an effort to force the government to be more transparent about personal data requests.

Several of the largest U.S. tech firms, including Microsoft, Google, Facebook and Dropbox, have been fighting government requests for their users' private data.

The government has said that it will publish the total number of national security requests for customer data annually. But Microsoft and Google maintain that they should be able to break out how often the feds request specific user content, such as email conversations.
