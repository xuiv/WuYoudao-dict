Blast Hits Thai Anti-Government Protesters

Thai police say at least 22 people have been wounded by an explosion that went off in Bangkok during a march of anti-government protesters led by opposition leader Suthep Thaugsuban.

Authorities say the blast occurred after 1 p.m. in the capital on Friday. Television footage showed several protesters covered in blood, but here have been no immediate reports of deaths.

Protesters were seen searching nearby buildings for the unidentified attackers, while ambulances rushed the wounded away. Police are investigating what type of explosive caused the blast.

There has been a series of drive-by shootings that protesters blame on the government.

Protest leader Suthep is calling for an unelected people's council to replace the current government, which he says is corrupt and engages in nepotism.

Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra has refused to step down. She insists on holding early elections on February 2, though the opposition has said it will boycott the polls.

**美国调查“令人不安”的伊拉克境内照片**


美国国防部说，据称展示美国海军陆战队员焚烧看来是伊拉克叛乱分子尸体的照片“令人不安”。

五角大楼发言人柯比星期四说，有关官员必须让海军陆战队牵头对这些照片进行调查，然后才能确定照片的真实性。

美国海军陆战队星期三展开调查。几天前，娱乐网站TMZ.com将这些照片送交五角大楼。

TMZ网站登出了其中八张照片，并声称该网站被告知，这些照片是在伊拉克西部城市费卢杰拍摄的。10年前，美国军队曾与叛乱分子在费卢杰激战。

在照片中，一名看来身穿美国海军陆战队军装的人向叛乱分子尸体上浇易燃的液体。其他照片显示尸体在燃烧。

美国国防部官员说，这些画面看来并不构成战争罪行。但他们表示，海军陆战队员们可能违反了禁止粗暴对待尸体以及在战场进行不当拍照的军纪。

US Probing "Disturbing" Iraq Photos

The U.S. Defense Department says photos that purportedly show Marines burning bodies of what appear to be dead Iraqi insurgents are "disturbing."

A Pentagon spokesman, Rear Admiral John Kirby, said Thursday that officials must let a Marine-led probe into the photos take its course before determining their authenticity.

The U.S. Marine Corps launched its investigation on Wednesday, several days after the photos were turned over to the Pentagon by the entertainment website TMZ.com.

TMZ, which posted eight of the photos, says it was told they were taken in the western Iraqi city of Fallujah, the scene of fierce fighting between U.S. forces and insurgents 10 years ago.

In the photos, a person in what looks like a Marine uniform appears to be pouring a flammable liquid on dead insurgents. Other photos show the bodies on fire.

U.S. defense officials say the images do not appear to constitute war crimes. But they say the Marines possibly violated military rules that prohibit the mishandling of remains and inappropriate photos on the battlefield.
