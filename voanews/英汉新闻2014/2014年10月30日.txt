**缅甸总统召集各党派开会**

缅甸总统吴登盛召集军方，各政党领导人和少数民族团体代表举行历史性会谈。

会议将于星期五在首都内比都举行，资深民主领袖昂山素季等六个党派的代表将与会。

缅甸正在走出数十年军人的直接统治，因此也引发了一些紧张关系。缅甸是首次举行这样的会议。

昂山素季领导的政党“全国民主联盟”长期以来致力于推动宪法改革，限制军方的权力。

预计，全国民主联盟将在明年10月底或11月初的议会选举中获得好的成绩。

这将是缅甸名义上文官政府2011年掌权，施行一系列政治经济改革以来，缅甸举行的第二次大选。

这些改革受到缅甸反对党领袖，外国政府和人权团体的赞许。但是很多人仍抱怨缅甸的宪法由于昂山素季已故的丈夫和两个儿子是英国人而禁止昂山素季参选总统。

缅甸宪法还规定，要确保军方在议会中占有至少25%的席位。

Myanmar President Calls Meeting of Top Army, Political Officials

Myanmar President Thein Sein has called for a landmark meeting with representatives of the country's military, top political parties and ethnic minority groups.

The summit to be held Friday in the capital, Naypyidaw, will bring together six political parties, including that of longtime democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi.

The meeting, the first of its kind, comes amid tensions as Myanmar, also known as Burma, emerges from decades of direct military rule.

Aung San Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy, has been pushing for constitutional changes that would limit the power of the military.

The NLD is expected to perform well during parliamentary elections, which will occur in late October or early November of next year.

It will be the country's second general election since a nominally civilian government took power in 2011 and enacted a series of political and economic reforms.

The reforms have been lauded by the country's opposition leaders, foreign governments and rights groups. But many still complain that the constitution bars Aung San Suu Kyi from the presidency, since her late husband and two sons are British.

The constitution also ensures that the military retains at least 25 percent of seats in parliament.

**以警察打死涉嫌枪击犹太人的巴勒斯坦人**

以色列警察开枪打死一名他们怀疑企图杀死一名以色列活动人士的巴勒斯坦男子。该活动人士号召耶路撒冷一个充满争议的宗教场所向更多犹太人开放。

以巴之间的关系在犹太人称为圣殿山，穆斯林称为尊贵圣殿的耶路撒冷旧城问题上变得十分紧张。两起事件加剧了这一局势。犹太人和穆斯林都把旧城奉为他们最神圣的地点之一。

以色列安全官员星期四关闭了该圣地，何时开放另行通知。巴勒斯坦权力机构主席阿巴斯称此举相当于“宣战”。

以色列警方表示，他们突袭了巴勒斯坦人赫加兹的住所。赫加兹几个小时前涉嫌向以色列人耶胡达•格里克开枪。当时格里克在一个集会上呼吁向犹太人开放圣地。

有关官员说，赫加兹还向以色列警察开枪，警方开枪还击，将其击毙。

Israeli Police Kill Palestinian Suspected of Shooting Jewish Activist

Israeli police have shot dead a Palestinian man they suspect of attempting to kill an Israeli activist known for pushing for greater access for Jews at a flashpoint religious site in Jerusalem.

The two incidents have heightened an already tense situation surrounding the Old City complex that Jews call the Temple Mount and Muslims refer to as the Noble Sanctuary. Both groups regard the site as one of their holiest.

Israeli security officials closed the area Thursday until further notice, a move that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called a "declaration of war."

Police said they stormed the home of Moatez Higazi hours after they suspect he shot Yehuda Glick outside a conference promoting Jewish access to the holy site.

Officials said Higazi shot at security forces, who then returned fire and killed him.
