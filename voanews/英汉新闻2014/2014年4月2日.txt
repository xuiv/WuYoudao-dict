**智利北部遭8.2级强震袭击 六人死亡**

智利沿海的海啸警报已被解除，在这之前几个小时，智利发生了8.2级大地震，造成至少六人死亡，并引发小规模海啸，迫使智利太平洋沿岸地区民众撤离。

这次地震发生在星期二晚间，震中在智利西北海岸外大约1百公里。地震在当地造成的滑坡堵塞了公路，并造成大面积断电。

美国地质调查局说，震中位于伊基克西北方向大约1百公里，随后发生数次余震，其中一次为6.2级。有些余震甚至在玻利维亚和秘鲁都有震感。

玻利维亚居民维内加斯说：“我当时在厨房。当我往饭厅走的时候，我看到台灯和前上的画都在晃动。我来自地震带，因为我是智利人。但是对玻利维亚来说，这是强震了。”

智利总统巴切莱特已宣布灾区进入紧急状态。她在星期二夜间发表讲话，敦促智利人保持镇静。

她说：“已经采取了适当措施保护人们的生命和财产。政府将继续采取一切必要行动应对这一紧急情况，保护我们的公民。”

地震发生数小时后，智利沿海出现大约两米高的大浪。目前还没有关于海啸造成损失的报道。

据报道，至少六人因墙壁倒塌或者心脏病发作而死亡。

Six Dead as Magnitude 8.2 Earthquake Hits Northern Chile

Tsunami warnings have been lifted for Chile's coastline; hours after a strong 8.2-magnitude earthquake killed at least six people in Chile and set off a small tsunami that prompted evacuations along the country's Pacific coast.

The earthquake late Tuesday was centered about 100 kilometers off Chile's northwestern coast. It caused landslides that blocked highways and widespread power outages.

President Michelle Bachelet has declared a state of emergency in the region. In a late-night address, she urged citizens to stay calm.

"Appropriate measures have been taken to protect their lives and their belongings. And the government will continue to work all the time that is necessary to confront this emergency and protect our citizens."

Waves measuring about two meters hit the Chilean coast in the hours following the quake. No damage from the waves has been reported.

At least six people were reported dead after being crushed by collapsing walls or experiencing heart attacks.


**斯里兰卡取缔16个泰米尔流亡组织**

斯里兰卡下令取缔16个泰米尔海外流亡组织，包括泰米尔猛虎组织，指称他们从事恐怖主义。

斯里兰卡政府冻结了这些组织的资产并禁止公民向这些组织提供支持或与他们保持任何联系。

科伦坡说，政府是根据联合国安理会的一项决议而采取的行动。这项决议要求加大反恐力度，采取切断恐怖组织经费来源等一系列行动。

泰米尔猛虎组织为了在斯里兰卡建立独立的泰米尔国家而打了30年的内战。

上星期，联合国同意针对斯里兰卡政府军在战争最后几年期间犯有暴行和战争罪的指称展开国际调查。

斯里兰卡政府谴责这项调查是出于政治动机而且偏袒一方。

Sri Lanka Bans 16 Tamil Groups in Exile

Sri Lanka has banned 16 Tamil groups in exile, including the Tamil Tigers, for alleged terrorism.

The Colombo government has frozen the assets of the organizations and barred citizens from supporting them or having any contact with them.

Sri Lankan says it is acting under a United Nations Security Council resolution that steps up the fight against terrorism by, among other actions, trying to cut off funding for terror groups.

Tamil Tiger rebels fought a 30 year-long civil war for an independent Tamil state on Sri Lanka.

The United Nations last week approved an international investigation into alleged atrocities and war crimes by Sri Lankan forces during the last years of the war.

The Sri Lankan government has denounced the investigation as politically motivated and one-sided.
