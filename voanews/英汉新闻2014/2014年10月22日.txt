**美爵士大师肯尼.G看望香港抗议民众**

美国爵士大师肯尼.G在中国具有特殊地位。他演奏杰作乐曲四分钟的《回家》在中国的大街小巷到处播放。

这位萨克斯乐手星期三在推特上推出一张自己和香港民主示威者的合影。香港的示威者要求在选择香港的领导人时减少来自从北京政治影响。合影引起网上尤其是香港政治改革支持者的一片叫好。

照片中，肯尼.G（他的全名是肯尼.戈利克）在一幅抗议旗帜前打出V型胜利手势。这幅标语上写着“香港人争取香港的民主。”

肯尼•G在自己的推特上写道：“香港示威现场。我祝愿大家都能以和平和积极方式结束目前的局面。”

支持民主的组织“全球声援香港争取真普选”在推特上和3万6千多名成员分享了肯尼.G的这张照片，同时写道，“回家？没有公民提名权可不行。”

但是中国外交部的调子则明显不同。中国外交部发言人华春莹说，尽管肯尼.G的音乐在中国很受欢迎，但是中国对香港非法占中活动的立场非常清晰。

她补充说，“希望外国政府及个人言行审慎，不要以任何形式支持占中及其他违法行为。”

肯尼.G上个月刚刚在中国举办了4场音乐会，其中一场就在北京举行。

Kenny G in Hong Kong with the protesters

U.S. jazz musician Kenny G has a special place in China, where his song, the four-minute solo, "Going home," a mega hit in the country, lives on as the theme from shops to schools.

So when the saxophonist posted a photo of himself to Twitter on Wednesday at a pro-democracy demonstration in Hong Kong, where protesters are lobbying for less political influence from Beijing in selecting the territory's leadership, the irony of Kenny G's presence was not lost on reform supporters.

In the photo, Kenny G, whose full name is Kenneth Gorelick, holds two fingers up in a "V" peace sign as he stands in front of a protest banner that reads in part "Democracy of Hong Kong by Hong Kong."

"In Hong Kong at the sight of the demonstration. I wish everyone a peaceful and positive conclusion to this situation," he wrote on his official Twitter account.

Pro-democracy group Global Solidarity HK shared the musician's photo with its more than 3,600 followers on Twitter, adding the comment: "'Going Home?' Not without Civil Nomination."

But China's foreign ministry sang a different tune. Spokeswoman Hua Chunying said that while Kenny G's music is "widely popular in China... China's position on the illegal Occupy Central activities in Hong Kong is very clear."

"We hope that foreign governments and individuals speak and act cautiously and not support the Occupy Central and other illegal activities in any form," she added.

Kenny G played four concerts in China last month, including in the capital Beijing.


**克里谈朝鲜释放美国人：没有交易**

美国国务卿克里说，朝鲜本星期突然释放美国人杰佛里.福尔，在这件事上，美国和朝鲜之间没有任何交易。用他的话说“没有报偿”。

一向神秘的朝鲜突然释放了美国人杰佛里.福尔。美国官员星期二宣布，福尔已经离开朝鲜，返回美国。

福尔持旅游签证前往朝鲜。他半年之前被逮捕，因为他在朝鲜的一个餐馆酒吧留下一部《圣经》。

他的家人否认他前往朝鲜是为了传教。

美国国务院发言人哈尔夫说，美国继续关注其他两名仍被关押在朝鲜的美国人。

美国公民马修•米勒被朝鲜当局以对朝鲜有“敌对”行为的罪名判处6年劳改。裴俊浩则因同样的“敌对”罪名被判15年监禁。

克里星期三在柏林表示，希望很快恢复与朝鲜的无核化会谈。

No Deal in N. Korea Prisoner Release - Kerry

US Secretary of State John Kerry says there was no deal (in his words "quid pro quo" ) involved in North Korea's unexpected release of an American prisoner this week.

The reclusive nation abruptly freed Jeffrey Fowle, and U.S. officials announced Tuesday that he was heading home to the United States.

Fowle, who arrived in North Korea on a tourist visa, was arrested six months ago after leaving a Bible in a North Korean restaurant and bar.

His family denied that he traveled to the country on a church-related mission.

State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said there is continued concern about the two Americans who remain in custody.

Miller was sentenced to six years of hard labor after being convicted of “hostile” acts against North Korea. Bae received a 15-year prison sentence, also for “hostile” acts.))

Speaking in Berlin on Wednesday, Kerry also expressed hope that denuclearization talks with Pyongyang could start again soon.
