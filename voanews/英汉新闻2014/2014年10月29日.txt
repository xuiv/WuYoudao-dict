**朝鲜允许人权官员来访，诚意受质疑**

朝鲜表示，准备允许联合国人权官员对朝鲜进行前所未有的访问。但是许多分析人士质疑朝鲜这一允诺的诚意。

这一提议是在朝鲜外交官与联合国人权调查员马祖基•达鲁斯曼举行会谈时提出的。

这项出乎意料的提议被视为朝鲜这个高度神秘、独裁政府采取的重要步骤。联合国最近的人权报告指控朝鲜犯有危害人类罪。

不过，朝鲜的邀请有一个重要的附加条件：平壤希望拟议的联合国决议删除有关向国际刑事法院起诉朝鲜侵犯人权的内容。

该决议将于本星期提交给联大，预计将在下个月的表决中顺利获得通过。

许多分析人士认为，朝鲜的建议是阻挠投票的最后一搏。很多人怀疑平壤是否真的会向联合国观察员提供不受限制的访问。

韩国的釜山国立大学的罗伯特•凯利说：“如果是我，我不会做这种交换，因为一旦同意放弃向国际刑事法院提出指控，朝鲜就会故伎重演：开始对细节鸡蛋里挑骨头。”

也有人怀疑朝鲜是否会允许视察员访问朝鲜严重侵犯人权的场所，比如臭名昭著的监狱集中营。凯利说，如果没有这样的保证，就不能接受朝鲜提出的交易。

他说：“必须得到认真、严肃的保证，必须是一大批人去访问朝鲜，访问的自由度必须很大。否则，如何保证一切都可以看，而不是人到了那里才发现上当了呢？”

达鲁斯曼本人星期二表示，任何可能对朝鲜的访问“不能只是为了访问而访问”。他说：“任何访问将应该被视为是允许联合国报告员进入任何地点和国际社会普遍关注的机构。”

达鲁斯曼说，他同意向该决议提案国日本和欧洲联盟提出删除向国际刑事法庭控告朝鲜的内容。但欧盟和日本官员没有表示这是否有可能性。

如果平壤的提议被拒绝，目前还不清楚这项不具约束力的联合国决议除了让北朝鲜领导人尴尬以外会有什么样的效果。

如果这项决议在安全理事会投票表决，几乎肯定会被朝鲜唯一的重要盟友中国否决。大多数分析人士认为，其结果是，这项决议使朝鲜领导人被起诉的可能性极小。

但是凯利说，尽管如此，已经取得了重要进展，即使唯一的结果是迫使中国否决这项决议。他说：“这将让中国承受道义上的压力，因为中国在乎它在世界上的声誉。”

他说：“如果我们可以利用这一点，对中国说：‘你看，全世界都知道你是朝鲜的支持者，你的全球形象受到损害，你是在为世界上最糟糕的独裁统治解围。’ 希望我们可以利用这一点让中国离朝鲜远一些。”

NKorea Offers UN Visit, But Motives Questioned

North Korea says it is prepared to allow what would be an unprecedented visit to the country by United Nations human rights officials, but many analysts are questioning the sincerity of the offer.

The proposal was made this week during landmark talks between North Korean diplomats and a special U.N. human rights investigator on North Korea, Marzuki Darusman.

The unexpected offer was seen as an important step for the highly secretive and authoritarian government, which was accused in a recent U.N. report of committing crimes against humanity.

But the invitation comes with an important condition: Pyongyang wants a proposed U.N. resolution to drop language recommending it be tried for its alleged rights abuses at the International Criminal Court.

The resolution is being presented this week to the General Assembly. It is expected to be easily approved during a vote next month.

Many analysts see North Korea's proposal as a last-minute attempt to fend off the vote, and many doubt Pyongyang really intends to provide unfettered access to U.N. observers.

"I wouldn't make that swap," says Robert Kelly with South Korea's Pusan National University. "Because once they agree to drop (the ICC referral), then the North Koreans will do what they always do with agreements: they'll start to hem and haw and pick away at the details."

There are also doubts about whether the inspectors would be allowed to access the sites of North Korea's worst alleged abuses, such as its notorious prison camps. Without any such assurances, Kelly says North Korea's bargain is unacceptable.

"You've got to get some really serious guarantee that it's going to be a big party that will go to North Korea, that they're going to have a lot of access. And how do you guarantee that access before so that it doesn't get flim-flammed when they're on the ground?" Kelly asks.

For his own part, Darusman on Tuesday said any potential visit to North Korea "can't be a visit just for the sake of visiting."

"Any visit would have to be undertaken with a view to allow the rapporteur access into any location, institution that would be a primary concern of the international community," he said.

Darusman said he agreed to speak with the resolution's sponsors, Japan and the European Union, about dropping the ICC referral. But EU and Japanese officials have not said whether this is a possibility.

If Pyongyang's offer is rejected, it is unclear what moving ahead with the nonbinding U.N. resolution could accomplish, beyond simply embarrassing North Korea's leaders.

If the resolution were to be taken up by the Security Council, it is almost certain to be vetoed by China, North Korea's only major ally. As a result, most analysts concede it is highly unlikely the resolution could result in North Korean leaders being prosecuted.

But Kelly says important progress has been made, nonetheless, even if the only tangible result is forcing China to veto the resolution.

"It puts moral pressure on China," he says. "China worries about its reputation in the world."

"If we can sort of leverage that and say to China, 'Look, your global image is being tarred by the fact that you're North Korea's patron and everybody knows it, you're bailing out the world's worst autocracy.' Hopefully we can use that as leverage for China to draw some distance."


**俄罗斯向国际空间站发射货运火箭**

俄罗斯在美国火箭升空爆炸后几个小时之后，从哈萨克斯坦成功发射了向国际空间站运送补给的一艘无人飞船。

一枚联盟号火箭运载进步57号货运飞船星期二从拜科努尔航天中心升空，预计今天晚些时候和国际空间站对接。

星期二，一艘为国际空间站运送补给和设备的无人商业火箭从美国维吉尼亚州大西洋海岸外的瓦勒普斯岛升空几秒钟后爆炸。

负责向国际空间站运输补给的美国政府的承包商轨道科学公司表示，在星期二的爆炸原因确定之前，不会再发射安塔瑞斯火箭。

爆炸事件没有造成地面人员受伤。美国国家航空航天局表示，国际空间站的成员没有食品或者其他关键给养用尽的危险。

Russia Launches ISS Cargo Mission after US Rocket Explodes

Russia successfully launched an unmanned rocket with supplies for the International Space Station from Kazakhstan on Wednesday, hours after a catastrophic explosion destroyed a similar mission in the United States.

A Soyuz rocket and Progress 57 cargo ship blasted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome and is expected to dock with the ISS later in the day.

On Tuesday, an unmanned commercial rocket with supplies and equipment for the space station burst into fiery fragments just seconds after liftoff from Wallops Island, in the U.S. state of Virginia off the Atlantic coast.

Orbital Sciences Corporation, the company contracted by the U.S. government to send supplies to the Space Station, says it will not launch another Antares rocket until the cause of Tuesday's explosion is determined.

No one on the ground was hurt. The U.S. space agency, NASA, said the International Space Station crew "is in no danger of running out of food or other critical supplies."
