**联合国呼吁解决渡海难民问题**

联合国难民署说，国际社会必须更有效地解决数十万人为寻求庇护或移民而冒险渡海的问题。

联合国难民署高级专员古特雷斯星期三和星期四在日内瓦主持一次会议，讨论海上救助问题以及如何鼓励采取较安全的移民途径，并设法解决导致人们逃离家园的根本原因。

联合国难民署说，今年至少有34万8千人试图渡海，据报很可能有4272人死亡。

最危险的路线是地中海，2014年有3400多人死在途中。地中海上的难民人数不断增多，今年20万7千人曾冒险渡海。联合国说，这个数目被2011年增加了两倍以上。

UN Urges World to Address Surge in 'Risky' Attempts to Flee by Sea

The United Nations refugee agency says the world needs to better focus on responding to the hundreds of thousands of people making "risky" sea journeys in search of asylum or migration.

UNHCR chief Antonio Guterres is hosting a conference Wednesday and Thursday in Geneva to discuss rescues at sea, ways to encourage safer forms of migration and addressing the underlying causes of why people are fleeing their countries to begin with.

The agency says at least 348,000 people have tried to make sea crossings so far this year, a likely record, with 4,272 reported deaths.

The most dangerous routes have been across the Mediterranean Sea where more than 3,400 people have died in 2014. The area has seen a surge of activity with 207,000 people trying to make the trip, which the U.N. says is more than triple the previous high from 2011.


**前中国发改委副主任刘铁男被判终身监禁**

一名前中国高层经济规划官员因受贿罪被判终身监禁，成为在中国反腐运动中最新入狱的备受关注的人物。

中国官方的新华社说，刘铁男被判定在其担任国家发改委副主任期间收受相当于580万美元的贿赂。国家发改委是中国经济规划最高机构。
对刘铁男的指控于2012年12月首次曝光，当时财经杂志的一名记者在其微博上透露了有关信息。

刘铁男起初坚决否认对他的指控。但在9月接受审判时，60岁的刘铁男流着眼泪承认收受贿赂，包括现金、一辆保时捷跑车和位于北京的一座豪华别墅。

在中国共产党控制下的法院的有罪裁定率几乎为100%，因此无人怀疑刘铁男会被判有罪。但检方曾请求法院从宽处理，理由是刘铁男与调查人员配合。

廊坊市一家法院星期三做出这项判决，这是刘铁男控罪的最高刑期。

刘铁男还曾担任中国国家能源局局长。他是在中国国家主席习近平发起的反腐运动中被起诉的50多名高官之一，此外还有很多级别较低的官员落马。

Former Senior Chinese Politician Gets Life in Prison for Bribery


A former top Chinese economic planning official has been convicted of bribery and sentenced to life in prison, becoming the latest high-profile figure to be brought down by China's anti-corruption campaign.

The official Xinhua news agency said Liu Tienan was found guilty of taking $5.8 million in bribes during his time as the deputy head of the National Development and Reform Commission, China's top economic planning body.

The allegations against Liu first surfaced in December 2012 when a journalist at the Caijing investigative magazine posted the stories on his microblog.

Liu at first forcefully denied the charges. But at his trial in September, the 60-year-old was seen tearfully confessing to taking various bribes, including cash, a Porsche, and a luxury Beijing villa.

That Liu would be found guilty was never in doubt, since China's Communist Party-controlled courts have a conviction rate nearing 100 percent. But prosecutors had pleaded for leniency, arguing he had cooperated with investigators.

In the end, the sentence delivered Wednesday by a court north of the capital in Langfang was the maximum allowed for the crimes.

Liu, who also served as the director of the National Energy Administration, is one of more than 50 high-ranking officials to face charges under President Xi Jinping's anti-graft campaign. Many more low-level officials have been brought down.
