**中国证实进行了高超音速导弹传送器试验**

中国进行了高超音速飞行器试验，这种飞行器的速度是音速的数倍。

中国国防部没有对试验结果发表评论，声称这次试验是科学性质，并非针对任何特定国家。
五角大楼证实了这一消息，但没有发表评论，目前一些美国人对中国军力迅速增长感到担忧。
如果高超音技术得到完善，拥有这种技术的国家就能避开导弹防御系统，在几分钟内打击世界任何地区的目标。
华盛顿自由灯塔网站率先报道了有关这次试验的消息，并援引美国官员的话说，这种飞行器的速度为10马赫，即音速的10倍。

China Confirms Hypersonic Missile Delivery Test

China has conducted an experimental flight of a hypersonic missile delivery vehicle designed to travel several times faster than the speed of sound.

Beijing's Defense Ministry did not comment on the outcome of the test, which it called scientific in nature and not targeted at any particular country.

The Pentagon confirmed, but would not comment on, the Chinese test, which comes as some in the U.S. worry about China's rapid military growth.

If perfected, hypersonic technology could allow countries to strike targets anywhere in the world within minutes, going undetected by missile defense systems.

The test was first reported by the Washington Free Beacon, which quoted U.S. officials who said the vehicle flew at Mach 10, or 10 times the speed of sound.

**泰国当局调查水稻项目是否有腐败**

泰国当局说，他们将开始对政府补贴稻农的项目进行反腐调查，这是备受攻击的英拉总理遭到的最新挫折。

泰国反腐机构星期四宣布了这一举动。泰国反对党抗议人士对此表示欢迎。他们连续多日在曼谷举行反政府示威，要求英拉下台。

按照这个补贴项目，政府以高于市场的价格从泰国那里手中购买稻米。目前，政府手中积压了大批卖不出去的稻米。

批评人士说，这一项目耗费了国家数以百万计美元。他们说，英拉利用补贴争取农村选民的支持。农村人口是她的执政党为泰党的主要票仓。

宣布反腐调查是否会给反对派的抗议运动注入新的活力，还有待观望。抗议运动出现势头减弱的迹象。

反政府抗议者星期四在曼谷的政府税收办公楼外游行。虽然有数千人参加游行，还有很多人留在曼谷各主要路口，继续在那些地段安宁扎寨，但抗议人数正在减少。

Thai Authorities to Investigate Rice Program for Corruption

Thai authorities say they will start a corruption investigation into a government subsidy program for rice farmers, in the latest setback for embattled Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra.

The country's anti-corruption agency on Thursday announced the move. It was welcomed by Thai opposition protesters who have staged days of anti-government demonstrations in Bangkok calling for Mrs. Yingluck to step down.

Under the program, the government purchased rice from Thai farmers for above market prices. The government is now stuck with large stockpiles of rice it has been unable to sell.

Critics say the program cost the country millions of dollars. They say Mrs. Yingluck used the initiative to win support among the rural population, which represents the main base of her ruling Pheu Thai party.

It is yet to be seen whether the announcement will breathe life into the opposition protest movement, which is showing signs of losing momentum.

Opposition protesters marched outside government revenue offices in Bangkok on Thursday. Though thousands showed up for the march, and many more remained camped out in key intersections throughout the city, the numbers are dwindling.
