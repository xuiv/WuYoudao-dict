**利比亚对立民兵组织机场交火**

利比亚敌对派系的民兵组织星期天在首都附近的机场展开了激烈的战斗,至少有3人丧生，周三以前的航班已被取消。

一个伊斯兰武装组织星期天凌晨袭击了来自利比亚西北部津坦的民兵。这场战斗是6个月来最激烈的。自2011年前独裁者卡扎菲被推翻以来，来自津坦的民兵一直控制着的黎波里国际机场。

机场官员说，火箭弹星期天拂晓时击中机场的一个设施。

伊斯兰民兵联合组织“利比亚革命行动会”宣称对袭击负责。该组织被认为是争夺议会控制权的两大政治派系的军事组织。

美国国务院发言人莎琪星期六说，美国对利比亚目前的暴力可能导致广泛的冲突“深感关切”。

** Tripoli Fighting Kills Three, Closes Airport**

Heavy fighting between militias vying for control of the airport in Libya's capital has killed at least three people and grounded flights through the middle of the week.

An armed Islamist group attacked Zintan militiamen, who have controlled Tripoli International Airport since the overthrow of Moammar Gadhafi in 2011, in some of the worst fighting the country has seen in six months.

An airport official said rockets hit the facility just before sunrise Sunday. The Operations Cell of Libyan Revolutionaries, a coalition of Islamist militias, claimed responsibility.

The opposing groups are seen as the armed wings of two political factions, the liberals and Alarmists, struggling for the upper hand in the Libyan parliament.

On Saturday, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said (in a statement) the U.S. is "deeply concerned" the ongoing violence in Libya could lead to "widespread conflict."

**伊拉克反政府力量再度向巴格达逼近**


伊拉克激进分子星期天凌晨袭击了巴格达南面约80公里的杜鲁伊亚镇，占领了当地政府建筑，并打死至少6人，其中有两名警察。

伊拉克政府军上个月曾从反叛力量手里夺回杜鲁伊亚。但看起来反政府力量再次向巴格达挺进。

另外，陷入僵局的伊拉克议会星期天宣布休会。休会前，议会未能就两个高级职务的人选达成一致意见。组建新政府之前，议会要先提出候选人。伊拉克议会计划星期二再次开会。

联合国伊拉克援助团负责人姆拉德诺夫曾敦促伊拉克议员出席周日会议。他说，如果不能组建新政府，伊拉克会更加混乱。

另外，枪手星期六袭击了巴格达的一所公寓楼，杀死至少29人，其中大多数是妇女。截止到目前，还没有人声称为这次袭击负责。

星期六早些时候，国际人权组织“人权观察”指责伊拉克安全部队和政府支持的民兵上个月非法处决了至少255名俘虏。人权观察说，这些俘虏分别在伊拉克6个村镇被处决。

人权观察说，绝大多数俘虏是逃离反政府极端组织的逊尼派穆斯林。

**Militants Seize Iraqi Town**

Iraqi militants have attacked a town north of Baghdad, seizing local government buildings and killing at least 6 people, including two police officers.

Officials say the assault on Dhuluiya, about 80 kilometers north of the capital, began early Sunday. Government forces had retaken Dhuluiya last month after it had been overrun by the militants, but a new drive toward Baghdad appears to be under way.

On Saturday, gunmen stormed an apartment building in a Baghdad neighborhood, killing at least 29 people, mostly women.

No one has claimed responsibility for the attack and the motive is also not known.

Earlier Saturday, Human Rights Watch accused Iraqi security forces and government-backed militias of illegally executing at least 255 prisoners in the last month.

The group says the executions were carried out in six towns and villages.

Human Rights Watch says most of the prisoners were Sunnis who had run away from the extremist groups fighting to topple the government.
