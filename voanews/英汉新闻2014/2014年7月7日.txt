**印度：伊斯兰律法不具法律效力**

印度最高法院裁决，伊斯兰律法和伊斯兰教令对印度的穆斯林没有法律效力。

印度高法星期一说，伊斯兰教法官只有在个人自愿请他们裁决时才能解释宗教律法，但是这些法官下达的宗教令不具法律约束力。

最高法院说，不能允许任何宗教遏制任何人的根本权利。

在有人申诉请求解散伊斯兰教法庭后，印度高法作出了这项裁决。

一名律师在2005年提出了这项申诉，申诉所援引的案例是一个伊斯兰教法庭下令一名妇女离开丈夫和孩子，去跟据称强奸了她的岳父一道生活。

India: Sharia Courts Have No Legally Binding Powers

India's Supreme Court has ruled Sharia courts and fatwas have no legal power over the country's Muslims.

The top court said Monday Islamic judges who interpret religious law could only rule when individuals submitted voluntarily to them, but the judges' decisions, or fatwas, are not legally binding.

The Supreme Court said no religion is allowed to curb anyone's fundamental rights.

The court's ruling was given on a petition to disband Sharia courts.

A lawyer filed the petition in 2005, citing the case of a woman who was ordered by a Sharia court to leave her husband and children to live with her father-in-law who had allegedly raped her.

**以色列空袭后哈马斯誓言报复**

激进组织哈马斯说，以色列对加沙地带进行了一系列空袭，炸死七名哈马斯战斗人员。

哈马斯星期一发表的声明说，还有四人受伤。哈马斯誓言，以色列将为这些空袭“付出巨大代价”。

以色列军方表示在夜间进行了这些空袭，这是对以军所说的激进分子从加沙发射的25枚火箭所做的回应。以军还报告说，星期一清晨，安全部队在加沙一处安全屏障附近遭遇袭击，随后爆发冲突。

星期天，以色列总理内塔尼亚胡再次呼吁保持镇静，并誓言绝不允许双方的极端分子“在本地区挑起战火并带来新一波流血冲突”。

以巴矛盾在最近几个星期升级。三名以色列青少年被绑架和杀害。随后显然出于报复，一名巴勒斯坦少年被绑架并烧死。这些事件激化了紧张局势。

Hamas Vows Revenge for Deadly Israeli Airstrikes

The militant group Hamas says seven of its fighters have been killed by a series of Israeli airstrikes in the Gaza Strip.

A Hamas statement Monday said four people were also injured, and vowed that Israel would "pay a tremendous price" for the attacks.

The Israeli military said it carried out airstrikes overnight in response to what it said were 25 rockets fired by militants in Gaza into Israel. It also reported clashes early Monday after security forces were attacked near a security fence in Gaza.

On Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated appeals for calm, and vowed to not allow extremists from either side to "set the region on fire and bring a new wave of bloodshed."

Israeli-Palestinian tensions have increased in recent weeks following the deaths of three kidnapped Israeli teenagers and that of a Palestinian teen who was kidnapped and burned to death in an apparent act of revenge.
