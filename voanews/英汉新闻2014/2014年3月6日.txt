**欧盟对前乌克兰高官实施制裁**

欧盟冻结了前乌克兰政府18名高级官员的资产，包括被免职的亚努科维奇总统。

共有28个成员国的欧盟星期四清晨宣布了遭到制裁的前乌克兰官员名单。欧盟于星期三晚间做出决定，惩罚侵吞国家资产的前乌克兰官员。

亚努科维奇的儿子、他的前司法部长以及其他几名政府部长也被列入被冻结资产人员名单。亚努科维奇上月逃离乌克兰，此前乌克兰爆发示威活动，抗议亚努科维奇决定接受俄罗斯经济援助，而抗议活动演变为致命的暴力事件。

与此同时，旨在缓解乌克兰克里米亚半岛危机的新一轮外交活动将于星期四展开。欧盟成员国领导人将在布鲁塞尔举行会谈，考虑可能对俄罗斯实施的制裁措施。

美国国务卿克里将于星期四在罗马会见俄罗斯外长拉夫罗夫。此前克里已同拉夫罗夫、英国外交大臣黑格以及乌克兰临时外长德斯齐赛亚进行了一系列讨论。

在星期三的一系列谈判中，拉夫罗夫与德斯齐赛亚没有进行面对面对话。克里表示，他并未期待双方直接会谈。

EU Sanctions Ex-Ukrainian President as Crisis in Crimea Continues


The European Union has frozen the assets of 18 high-ranking officials of the former Ukrainian government, including ousted President Viktor Yanukovych.

The 28-nation bloc announced the names of those targeted by the sanctions early Thursday, after reaching a decision the night before to impose the punishments on those responsible for embezzlement of state funds.

Mr. Yanukovych's son, his former justice minister and several other government ministers are also among those whose assets have been frozen. Mr. Yanukovych fled Ukraine last month after protests over his decision to accept an economic aid package from Russia turned deadly.

Meanwhile, another round of international diplomacy aimed at easing the military crisis in Ukraine's Crimean peninsula will take place Thursday. Leaders of the EU nations will meet in Brussels to consider possible sanctions against Russia.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is scheduled to meet again with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Rome Thursday. Kerry held a series of discussions with Lavrov, British Foreign Secretary William Hague and Ukranian interim Foreign Minister Andriy Deshchytsia.

Lavrov and Deshchytsia did not meet face-to-face during Wednesday's flurry of negotiations, and Kerry said he had not expected such a meeting to occur.

**克里米亚议会投票赞成加入俄罗斯**


乌克兰动荡的克里米亚地区的议会投票赞成加入俄罗斯，这有可能进一步加剧紧张局势。

受到俄罗斯支持的克里米亚议会星期四举行投票的同时，欧盟领导人在布鲁塞尔举行紧急峰会，讨论如何向俄罗斯施压，迫使它从克里米亚撤军。美国国会星期四也开会讨论对俄罗斯实施经济制裁的问题。

位于黑海半岛的克里米亚人口的绝大多数是俄罗斯族人，克里米亚政府星期四说，它计划于3月16号就是否加入俄罗斯举行全民公决，并要求俄罗斯总统普京考虑这一请求。

路透社援引乌克兰经济部长的话说，有关克里米亚地位的全民公决是“违反宪法的”。

克里米亚与乌克兰分离的动向可能会动摇各方通过外交解决危机的努力。

Crimean Parliament Votes to Join Russia

Lawmakers in the embattled Ukrainian region of Crimea have voted to join Russia, in a move likely to further escalate tensions.

Thursday's vote by the Moscow-backed Crimean parliament comes as European Union leaders gather for an emergency summit in Brussels to discuss how to pressure Russia to back down from its military incursion into Crimea. U.S. lawmakers are also meeting Thursday to discuss potential economic sanctions against Russia.

The government of Crimea, a Black Sea peninsula with a majority Russian population, said Thursday it is scheduling a referendum on joining Russia for March 16. Russian President Vladimir Putin is being asked to consider the appeal.

The Reuters news agency quotes Ukraine's economy minister ((Pavlo Sheremeta)) as saying the referendum on Crimea's status is "unconstitutional."

Crimea's move to leave Ukraine is likely to shake up efforts toward a diplomatic resolution to the crisis.
