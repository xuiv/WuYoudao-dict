**尼日利亚首都公车站爆炸 恐怕造成惨重伤亡**

尼日利亚首都阿布贾的一处公共汽车站星期一发生爆炸，恐怕造成很多人死亡。

爆炸发生时，人们正在上班的路上。

目前还没有人宣称对袭击负责。

伊斯兰激进组织博科圣地经常发动这类袭击。这个组织试图在尼日利亚北部建立一个严格执行伊斯兰法律的国家。

上星期，疑似伊斯兰激进分子的人在博尔诺州发动了一次袭击，打死至少60人。

自从博科圣地组织2009年发动反政府暴动以来，据信他们已经杀害了数以千计的人。

国际特赦组织两个星期前说，仅在今年就有1500人死于跟博科圣地有关的暴力。

Many Feared Dead After Explosion in Nigerian Capital

An explosion has hit a bus station in Nigeria's capital with many people feared dead.

The blast Monday in Abuja happened as people were traveling to work.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.

The Islamist militant group Boko Haram often carries out attacks in its attempt to create a strict Islamic state in the northern part of Nigeria.

Last week, suspected Islamists killed at least 60 people on an attack in Borno State.

Boko Haram has been blamed for thousands of deaths since launching an insurgency against the government in 2009.

Amnesty International said two weeks ago that 1,500 people have died in Boko Haram-related violence this year alone.

Gunman Kills 3 at US Jewish Centers

Authorities in the central U.S. state of Kansas have identified a longtime white supremacist as the suspect in the killing of three people Sunday outside a Jewish community center and a Jewish retirement center.

Frazier Glenn Cross is due to appear in court Monday on charges of premeditated murder.

Police say 73-year-old Cross used a shotgun to kill a man and a teenage boy in the parking lot of the community center in the Kansas City suburb of Overland Park, Kansas. They say he then drove to the nearby retirement community and killed a woman before being arrested at an elementary school.

Police Chief John Douglass said Sunday it was too early to label it a hate crime.

President Barack Obama said the shooting was "horrific" and "heartbreaking," and expressed his support and that of his wife, Michelle, for the victims' families.
