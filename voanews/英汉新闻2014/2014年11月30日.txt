Pope Francis Wraps up Visit to Turkey

Pope Francis and the spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians have called for an end to the persecution of Christians in the Middle East, particularly in Iraq and Syria.

In a joint declaration, the Roman Catholic pope and Patriarch Bartholomew I said "we cannot resign ourselves to a Middle East without Christians."

The two religious leaders urged regional leaders to increase help to victims of Islamic State militants, writing that "the terrible situations of Christians and all those who are suffering in the Middle East calls not only for our constant prayer, but also for an appropriate response on the part of the international community."

The statement was issued as Pope Francis wrapped up his three-day visit to Turkey, during which he attended a liturgy alongside Bartholomew in the patriarchal Church of St. George.


**瑞士就是否限制移民数量进行公投**

瑞士星期天投票，决定是否对移民进行严格限制。这项倡议的反对者称这是一场恐惧外国人的公决，对经济具有灾难性后果。

这个所谓“黄金公投”把移民的增长限制在人口0.2%之内，也就是每年最多增加1万6千移民，而不是目前每年大约8万人的水平。倡议还要求瑞士把10%的国际发展援助预算用于海外的计划生育。批评人士认为此举带有“新殖民地主义”的意味。

瑞士自由党资深国会议员，同时也是反对黄金公投委员会的共同主席克里斯蒂安•卢舍尔对法新社说，这项倡议绝对是荒唐可笑的。他说，这项计划旨在大幅度、单方面和人为地减少瑞士的移民数量，根本不考虑经济的需要。他警告说，这样将使瑞士变得贫穷。

黄金公投的支持者说，外国人涌入使得地处阿尔卑斯山的瑞士人口膨胀，田园风光和绿色空间缩小。

民调显示，黄金公投和其他两项倡议将难以通过。

一项倡议要求瑞士中央银行增加黄金储备，还有一项倡议要求取消对海外富人税务优惠的法律。这会对给瑞士免税天堂的声誉大打折扣。

Switzerland Votes on Immigration Reform

Switzerland is voting Sunday to decide whether to impose radical limits on immigration, a referendum opponents to the proposal have labelled xenophobic and disastrous for the economy.

The so-called Ecopop initiative would cap immigration growth at 0.2 percent of the population, or an addition of 16,000 people annually instead of the current rate of roughly 80,000 per year. The initiative also calls for Switzerland to use 10 percent of its international development aid budget for family planning programs abroad, a move critics say smacks of "neocolonialism."

Christian Luescher, a parliamentarian for the Liberal Party and co-chair of the committee opposing Ecopop told the French News Agency the initiative is "absolutely absurd." He said the proposal aims to "drastically, linearly and arbitrarily reduce immigration to Switzerland, with absolutely no consideration for the needs of the economy." He warned the move would impoverish the country.

Ecopop supporters say the current influx of foreigners is swelling the Alpine nation's population and shrinking its idyllic landscapes and green spaces.

Polls suggest the Ecopop initiative will fail, along with two other proposals.

One proposal calls for the Swiss central bank to boost its gold reserves, while the other would scrap one of Switzerland's biggest tax perks for wealthy expatriates, dealing a blow to the country's reputation as a tax haven.
