Poroshenko Holds Big Lead in Ukraine Presidential Vote

Early results from Ukraine's presidential election show billionaire candy maker and former prime minister Petro Poroshenko with a commanding lead.

The country's election commission said Monday that Poroshenko led with 54 percent of the vote with about a third of the ballots counted.

Former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko was in second place with 13 percent.

Poroshenko claimed victory Sunday after exit polls showed him winning 56 percent of the vote, and said he is ready to negotiate with Russian officials.

Pro-Russian separatists threatened to disrupt the vote and blocked access to polling places in eastern Ukraine. No voting stations were open in the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk, while a scant 16 percent voter turnout is reported in the entire Donetsk region.

Thai Coup Leader Says He Has the King's Endorsement

Thailand's military chief and coup leader General Prayuth Chan-ocha says the king has formally endorsed his position as head of the military council that will run the country.

In a televised press briefing Monday, the general also said that he would have no choice but to use force if political protests flare up again. He said he aims for an election as soon as possible, but gave no timeframe for a vote.

Prayuth abruptly cut the news briefing short when a reporter asked a question.

The announcement came a day after military leaders warned protesters any further rallies against its coup will not be tolerated. The warning came after a series of clashes between soldiers and protesters across the country on Sunday.

Army officials said protesters would be arrested, jailed and tried in military court.
