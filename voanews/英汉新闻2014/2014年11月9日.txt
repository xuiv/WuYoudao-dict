** Germans Celebrating 25th Anniversary of the Fall of the Berlin Wall **
VOA News

Germans are celebrating the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, with Chancellor Angela Merkel praising the courageous people who helped bring it down.

The German leader led several events Sunday, including the placing of a rose in one of the few remaining sections of the Wall to commemorate those who died trying to escape to the West.

In a speech at the main memorial site for the Wall, Ms. Merkel said that "the fall of the Wall has shown us that dreams can come true." She called the Wall a "symbol of state abuse cast in concrete" that "took millions of people to the limits of what is tolerable."

The day's ceremonies in the German capital began with a trumpet call, evoking the trumpets the Bible says brought down the walls of Jericho.

Current and former world leaders are marking the occasion with warnings of continued divisions among major powers.

U.S. President Barack Obama issued a statement saying Russia's actions against Ukraine are a reminder that there is "more work to do" for Europe to be "whole, free and at peace."

The Berlin Wall divided the German capital and came to define the Cold War, which pitted the United States and its allies against the Soviet Union following World War Two.

Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev said Saturday that the world is on the brink of "a new Cold War," and that some say it has already begun.

At an event commemorating the Berlin Wall anniversary, Mr. Gorbachev said "bloodshed in Europe and the Middle East against the backdrop of a breakdown in dialogue between major powers is of enormous concern."

Ukraine's separatist bastion of Donetsk came under intense artillery fire Sunday, increasing strains on a two-month-old cease-fire deal between Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russian separatists.

European monitors in Ukraine say they are very concerned after seeing convoys of heavy weapons and tanks in separatist-controlled areas of Ukraine.

Swiss foreign minister and current chairman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Karl Erjave, said he is worried about a resurgence of violence. He urged all sides Saturday to do all in their power to further consolidate the cease-fire and stay away from acts that could lead to a new escalation.
