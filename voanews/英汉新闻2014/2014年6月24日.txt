**普京要求议会收回出兵乌克兰授权**

俄罗斯总统普京要求俄罗斯议会上院撤销授权总统出兵乌克兰的决定。俄罗斯议会上院3月授权总统出兵乌克兰，保护俄罗斯公民和讲俄语的乌克兰人。

普京在亲俄罗斯的乌克兰总统被赶下台后要求议会批准向乌克兰出兵。

克里姆林宫发言人皮斯科夫星期二说，普京要求取消授权是为了“促使东乌克兰局势正常化”，“也跟乌克兰三方会谈开始展开有关”。

乌克兰总统波罗申科对普京的做法表示欢迎。乌克兰总统办公室星期二说，波罗申科认为这是普京为支持和平计划而采取的第一个“实际步骤”。

亲俄分离主义领袖、俄罗斯特使和乌克兰谈判代表星期一在东部城市顿涅茨克开始谈判，目的在于结束危机。乌克兰的谈判代表是前总统库奇马。

美国总统奥巴马星期一晚上在电话上敦促普京总统帮助实施波罗申科的和平计划，首先实施波罗申科上星期五宣布的停火。官员们说，三方本星期将还将继续会谈。

白宫说，奥巴马总统呼吁普京向亲俄分离主义分子施加压力，要求他们遵守为期一周的停火，并停止从俄罗斯向乌克兰运送武器。

在乌克兰东部地区与政府军作战的亲俄分离分子的一名领导人星期一说，他们会遵守停火，直到6月27日。

**Putin Asks Parliament to Withdraw Request for Force in Ukraine**

President Vladimir Putin has asked the upper house of Russia's parliament to revoke the right it granted him in March to send the Russian military into Ukraine to defend Russian nationals and Russian-speaking Ukrainians

Mr. Putin had asked the Federation Council to authorize the use of Russian military force in Ukraine after the country's pro-Russian president was forced from power.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday that the new step was taken to "normalize" the situation in eastern Ukraine, "and also in connection with the beginning of trilateral talks on the issue."

Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko welcomed the move, with his office saying Tuesday that he views it as Mr. Putin's "first practical step" in support of the peace plan.

On Monday, pro-Russian separatist leaders joined Russian envoys and Ukrainian negotiators in the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk for talks aimed at ending the crisis. Former president Leonid Kuchma represented Ukraine.

Late Monday, U.S. President Barack Obama urged Mr. Putin by telephone to help implement Mr. Poroshenko's peace plan, starting with the cease-fire the Ukrainian president declared on Friday.

Officials say further talks are set for this week.

The White House said the U.S. president called on Mr. Putin to pressure the pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine to observe the week-long cease-fire and to halt the flow of weapons across the border from Russia to Ukraine.

A leader of pro-Russian separatists battling Ukrainian troops in eastern Ukraine said Monday that the rebels will observe a truce until June 27.

**泰前部长宣布成立反军事政变组织**

泰国首次出现有组织反对军事政变的迹象。一位前政府部长表示要与异议人士合作，恢复“民主原则”。

前总理英拉所在的泰国为泰党领袖乍鲁蓬在一封公开信中宣布组建“自由泰国人权和民主组织”。英拉在军方5月接管政府之前因宪法法院的裁决而被迫下台。

乍鲁蓬说，他们将在国内外组织反抗泰国军方的运动。他说，泰国军方是不民主的，企图继续在政治中发挥作用。

泰国代理外交部长对乍鲁蓬宣布成立反军方组织不以为然。他说，泰国只有一个合法政府。

目前还不清楚新成立的反军方组织总部设在何处，也不清楚他们将如何反对一直严厉镇压任何抗议迹象的军人政权。

**Organized Opposition to Thailand Coup Emerges**

The first sign of organized opposition to Thailand's military coup has emerged, with an ex-government minister vowing to work with fellow dissidents to restore "democratic principles."

The formation of the Organization of Free Thais for Human Rights and Democracy was announced Tuesday in an open letter by Jarupong Ruangsuwan.

Jarupong was the head of the Pheu Thai party of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, who was ousted by a Constitutional Court ruling just before the military takeover in May.

He said the new campaign will help organize resistance, both inside and outside the country, to the military, which he said was undemocratic and trying to preserve its role in politics.

Acting foreign minister, Sihasak Phuangketkeow, dismissed the announcement, saying there was "only one legitimate government" in Thailand.

It is not clear where the group will be based or how it even will oppose the junta, which has cracked down harshly on any sign of protest against its takeover.
