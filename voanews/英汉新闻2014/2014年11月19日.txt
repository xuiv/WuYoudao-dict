Vice President Biden to Visit Ukraine

U.S. Vice President Joe Biden has left Washington for a five day trip that will include talks with leaders in Ukraine later this week.

A senior White house official says Biden on Friday will convey U.S. concerns about "Russia’s ongoing violations of the September 5th Minsk agreement with Ukraine." The agreement called for a ceasefire between Kyiv and pro-Russian separatists.

The White House says Russia has not taken meaningful steps to implement its obligations under Minsk, such as removing all of its troops from Ukraine and stopping the flow of mercenaries, weapons and equipment across the border.

The U.S. says Moscow has also failed to allow an international observer mission to monitor the international border between Russia and Ukraine.

While in Ukraine, Biden will chair a roundtable discussion on anti-corruption and rule of law reforms.

Biden's trip will also include stops in Morocco and Turkey.

France Identifies 2nd French Citizen in Islamic State Video

French officials say they have identified a second Frenchman among the militants in a video showing the severed head of an American aid worker and the beheadings of at least 18 Syrian soldiers.

President Francois Hollande said Wednesday during a visit to Australia that two French nationals are in the video released by the Islamic State group, but did not give additional details.

Investigators said they believe the second man was a 22-year-old from a Paris suburb who traveled to Syria about a year ago.

On Monday, officials identified the first man in the video as Maxime Hauchard, another 22-year-old who went to Syria last year.

Mr. Hollande highlighted the danger of what he called young people being brainwashed by militants abroad.
