**叙利亚和谈即将在日内瓦复会**
叙利亚政府和反对阿萨德总统阵营的代表在日内瓦即将举行第二轮和谈。

星期一，联合国 - 阿拉伯国家联盟特使卜拉希米正在斡旋恢复谈判。这轮会谈延续上个月的首轮会谈。首轮会谈几乎没有取得进展，但卜拉希米称之为建设基础的“适度开端”。

双方在多方面问题上都存在很大分歧，从建立可能的过渡政府问题到允许向被围困地区运送人道主义援助。

饱受战争摧残的霍姆斯平民的处境是首轮谈判的部分议题。上周，叙利亚与联合国达成了三天停火协议，以允许援助进入这座城市。

霍姆斯市长巴拉兹说， 星期日从反政府力量控制地区疏散了600人。联合国和叙利亚红新月会工作人员营救了这一大批人。

尽管如此，目击者说，一些试图离开这个城市的妇女和儿童被迫击炮弹炸死或炸伤。

Syrian Peace Talks to Resume in Geneva

Delegates from Syria's government and the opposition to President Bashar al-Assad are in Geneva for a second round of peace talks.

U.N.-Arab League envoy Lakhdar Brahimi is mediating the negotiations resuming Monday. The talks follow an initial round last month that ended with little progress, but one that Brahimi called "a modest beginning" to build on.

Wide gaps remain on issues ranging from a potential transitional government to access for humanitarian aid in besieged areas.

The status of civilians in war-battered Homs was part of the initial round of talks, and last week Syria reached a three-day cease-fire agreement with the United Nations to allow aid into the city.

The governor of Homs, Talal Barazi, said 600 people were evacuated Sunday from rebel-held areas. Workers from the United Nations and Syrian Red Crescent rescued the large group.

Even so, eyewitness accounts said a number of women and children trying to leave the city were killed and wounded after being hit by mortar shells.

**泰农民抗议集会 要求取得稻米补贴**
泰国成百上千农民在位于首都曼谷的泰国司法部外面集会，追讨他们在一个有争议的稻米补贴计划中出售的大米的逾期未付款。

抗议领袖们周一表示，他们还计划游行到国防部，看守内阁总理英拉的临时办公室设在那里，要求她对逾期未付款采取行动。

反政府示威者的扰乱致使2月2日举行的提前选举在许多地方没能完成投票。这意味着在议会的空缺席位填满之前，政府仍然是一个支付能力有限的看守政府。而且，政府在谁有权决定新的投票日期问题上跟选举委员会陷入了一场争执。
Thai Farmers Protest to Demand Rice Payments

Hundreds of farmers have rallied outside Thailand's Justice Ministry in the capital, Bangkok, to demand overdue payments for rice sold in a controversial rice subsidy program.

Protest leaders said Monday they also plan to march to the Defense Ministry, where caretaker Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra has her temporary offices, to press her to take action on overdue payments.

Disruption by anti-government protesters of the February 2 snap election prevented voting from being completed in many locations. That means the government remains a caretaker administration with limited spending powers until vacant seats in parliament can be filled. And, the government has become involved in a dispute with the Election Commission over who has the power to set a new polling date.
