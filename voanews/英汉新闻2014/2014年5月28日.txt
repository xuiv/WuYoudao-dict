**中国加紧控制即时通信工具**

中国宣布，将开展为期一个月的治理行动，打击那些通过国内常用的即时通信工具传播非法和有害信息的人。

中国国家互联网信息办公室星期三说，这场行动将针对拥有微信等即时通信工具公众帐号的人。微信的用户超过八亿。

中国国家互联网信息办公室的声明说，这项行动的重点打击对象是那些利用即时通信工具传播谣言以及涉及暴力、恐怖、色情和欺诈信息的人。

该声明没有说明将采取那些检查措施，但表示如果即时通信服务商不遵守政府的有关规定，就要承担责任。

中国封闭了包括脸谱网和推特在内的很多受欢迎的国外社交网站，迫使中国公民不得不使用更容易受到控制的国内同类网站。

China Cracks Down on Instant Messaging Services

China has announced a month-long crackdown on those who spread "illegal and harmful information" on the country's popular instant messaging services.

The State Internet Information Office said Wednesday the campaign will target those with public accounts on services such as WeChat, which has over 800 million users.

The statement said the campaign will focus on "those spreading rumors and information related to violence, terrorism, and pornography, as well as those using instant messaging for fraud."

It did not specify what censorship measures would be taken, but said service providers would be held accountable if they do not comply with the government's demands.

China already blocks many popular foreign social media such as Facebook and Twitter, forcing its citizens to use domestic and more easily controlled alternatives.

**奥巴马计划在阿富汗保留近万驻军**

美国总统奥巴马星期三将在纽约西点军校毕业典礼上发表演讲，预计他将进一步阐述其外交政策。
星期二，奥巴马概述了有关阿富汗的计划，美国在阿富汗的战斗使命将于今年年底结束。
奥巴马在白宫发表讲话说，现在是把过去这十年这一页翻过去的时候了，其间美国外交政策非常偏重于阿富汗和伊拉克的两场战争。
奥巴马说，9800名美军将在阿富汗驻扎到2015年。在奥巴马2017年1月离任时，留在阿富汗的军队将不会超过1000人。
兰德公司南亚问题分析家姆诺兹说，有人担心相对快速的撤军可能使阿富汗处于危险境地。
姆诺兹在接受美国之音采访时说，奥巴马可能选择提早阐明自己的部署，以使阿富汗政府有更多时间做出反应。
目前美国在阿富汗有3.2万驻军，高峰期曾达到10万人。

Obama Wants 9,800 Troops in Afghanistan at Year's End

U.S. President Barack Obama is expected to shed more light on his foreign policy goals during a commencement address, on Wednesday, to U.S. Military Graduates in West Point, New York.

The speech comes a day after the president outlined his plans for Afghanistan, when the U.S. combat mission in the country closes at the end of this year.

In a White House statement, Mr. Obama said it is time to turn the page on the last decade when so much U.S. foreign policy was focused on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

He said 9,800 will remain in Afghanistan by 2015 and less than 1,000 when he leaves office in January 2017.

RAND Corporation South Asia analyst Arturo Munoz says there is concern that the relatively quick draw-down could leave Afghanistan vulnerable.

“What people are arguing for is an advisory mission, a training mission and a special commando-type mission to do raids--you know, special forces - but not with a short cut-off.”

In a VOA interview, Munoz said Mr. Obama may have chosen to lay out his strategy in advance in order to give the Afghan government more time to react.

There are currently 32,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, down from a peak of 100,000.
