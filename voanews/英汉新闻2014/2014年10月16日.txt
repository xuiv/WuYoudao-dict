**巴基斯坦军方空袭 炸死21名激进分子**

巴基斯坦军方表示，至少有21名武装反叛人士在军方于星期四发动的空袭中丧生。这次空袭的地点是巴基斯坦同阿富汗交界的一个部落地区。

巴基斯坦政府军表示，他们一天前还摧毁了五个被怀疑是武装反叛人士在偏远的蒂拉赫山谷地区的藏身处。之前，当地发生自杀式袭击，造成七名亲巴基斯坦政府的民兵死亡。

巴基斯坦军方官员认为恐怖分子利用他们所处的位置来袭击巴基斯坦安全部队以及争取和平的部落人士。

巴基斯坦部队正在附近的北瓦济里斯坦部落地区对激进分子展开攻势。那里是众所周知的巴基斯坦当地和境外武装激进人士汇集的地方。巴基斯坦官员称，军方今年六月发动攻势以来，已经击毙了大约一千一百名反叛分子。

Pakistan Army Kills 21 Militants in Air Strikes

Pakistan’s military says at least 21 insurgents were killed in air strikes on a tribal region near the Afghan border on Thursday.

Government forces say they also destroyed five suspected militant hideouts in the remote Terah Valley a day after a suicide attack killed seven members of a pro-government tribal militia in the area.

Army officials believe the suspected terrorists were using their positions to attack security forces and tribesmen campaigning for peace in the region.

Pakistani troops are engaged in a major counter-insurgency offensive in the nearby North Waziristan tribal region, a known hub of local and foreign militants. Officials claim to have killed around 1,100 insurgents since the offensive was launched in June.


**中国屏蔽BBC英文网站**

英国广播公司BBC说，它的英文网站在中国已经无法再登录。英国广播公司强烈批评这一做法，称它是“蓄意新闻审查”行为。

BBC世界新闻集团负责人彼德．霍罗克斯在星期三的声明中，强烈谴责他所说的“限制自由获取新闻和信息的”企图。

霍罗克斯说，BBC向中国当局表示抗议。中国当局一贯屏蔽包括美国之音在内的外国新闻机构的报道。

在中国外交部星期四的例行记者会上，有记者问及BBC英文网页被封一事，外交部发言人洪磊说中国按照法律来处理此事。洪磊说：“中国公民享有充分的网上自由。同时，中国政府依法管理互联网。”

几年来，中国所谓的长城防火墙一直屏蔽BBC的中文网页。星期三之前中国网民基本可以进入它的英文网页。

英国广播公司没有说中国当局扩大新闻审查是因为它报道中的任何特定方面。但在中国当局对BBC网站屏蔽的同时，香港连续几个星期发生要求民主的示威。

中国官方控制的媒体将实行半自治的香港地区的示威说成是破坏稳定的非法行为，这似乎是要试图阻止香港的示威蔓延到中国大陆。

China Blocks BBC English-Language Website

The British Broadcasting Corporation says its English-language website is no longer accessible in China, a move slammed by the broadcaster as an act of "deliberate censorship."

In a statement Wednesday, BBC World Service Group Director Peter Horrocks strongly condemned what he called the attempt to "restrict free access to news and information."

Horrocks says the BBC is protesting the move to Chinese authorities, which routinely block news reporting from foreign organizations, including the Voice of America.

When asked about the website blockage Thursday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei said only that the issue is being handled according to Chinese law.

"Chinese citizens have full Internet freedom. At the same time, the Chinese government manages the Internet in accordance with the law."

China's so-called Great Firewall has for years blocked the British broadcaster's Chinese-language website, though until Wednesday its English-language site was largely available.

The BBC did not say if it believes the expanded censorship is a result of any specific aspect of its reporting, though the move comes amid weeks of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.

China's state-controlled media have portrayed the protests in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory as illegal and destabilizing, in what appears to be an attempt to keep them from spreading to the mainland.
