**菲律宾抗议中国海警向菲渔民发射水炮**

菲律宾要求北京对中国海警部队据称在有争议的南海水域向菲律宾渔民发射水炮一事做出解释。

马尼拉星期二召见中国驻菲律宾大使，就这一事件提出抗议。这一事件上月发生在斯卡伯勒浅滩。这个无人居住的岛礁已成为导致菲律宾和中国之间出现军事紧张状态的焦点。

菲律宾外交部发言人埃尔南德斯说，马尼拉对发生在1月27日的这一骚扰行为表示强烈抗议，并敦促中国尊重菲律宾渔民在该海域的权利。

菲律宾总统阿基诺表示，他不想对可能属于“一次性”的这一事件做出过度反应，但希望了解该事件是否反映了中国的新政策。

中国外交部发言人华春莹说，北京“不接受菲律宾方面提出的抗议”。她表示，进行海事巡逻是为了“维护中国的主权”。

Philippines Protests Chinese Water Cannon Attack

The Philippines is demanding an explanation from Beijing, after the Chinese coast guard allegedly fired a water cannon at Filipinos fishing in a disputed area of the South China Sea.

Manila on Tuesday summoned China's top envoy in the Philippines' capital to protest the incident, which happened last month near the uninhabited Scarborough Shoal. The rocky outcrop has become a flashpoint in military tensions between both countries.

Foreign ministry spokesman Raul Hernandez said Manila "strongly protests the acts of harassment" in the January 27 incident and called on China to respect the rights of Philippine fishermen in the area.

Philippine President Benigno Aquino said he does not want to overreact to what may be a "one-off incident," but would like to know whether the case reflects a new Chinese policy.

In response, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Beijing "does not accept protestations from the Philippine side." She insisted the purpose of the sea patrols are to "uphold China's sovereignty."

EU Foreign Policy Chief Vows Support for Ukraine

The European Union's foreign policy chief is promising strong international support for Ukraine as it works to form a new government following the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych.

Catherine Ashton spoke at a news conference Tuesday while visiting the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. She said Western financial institutions are working on ways to help Ukraine's economy recover from three months of political protests. Ashton also urged Russia to let the nation find its own way forward out of its political crisis.

Earlier in the day, Ukraine's parliament postponed until Thursday plans to elect a new national unity government. Parliament speaker and acting president, Oleksandr Turchynov, made the announcement on Tuesday, when the legislature was due to unveil its new leaders.

Reports say the delay is meant to allow for further consultations on the issue.

U.S. Deputy Secretary of State William Burns is due in Ukraine Tuesday. He is expected to meet with acting president Turchynov, as well members of parliament.

The State Department said Burns "will urge the new government to take all steps necessary for free and fair presidential elections in May."

On Monday, the interim government in Ukraine issued an arrest warrant for ousted president Yanukovych, accusing him and other officials of mass murder of anti-government protesters.
