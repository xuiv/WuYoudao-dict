**美国宣布逮捕盗窃信用卡号的俄罗斯公民**

美国官员说，美国政府收押了一名俄罗斯公民，指控他盗窃和转卖数以十万计的个消费者信用卡号码。

这名嫌疑人是罗曼.瓦勒耶维奇.塞勒兹涅夫，现年30岁。星期一塞勒兹涅夫在关岛一家美国联邦法庭露面。法庭下令将他关押，等候7月22日再次聆讯。

美国司法部没有提供有关逮捕塞勒兹涅夫的任何细节。不过，当局说，他在2011年的一份秘密起诉书中受到指控。直到星期六塞勒兹涅夫在某个未披露的地点被抓之前，这份起诉书一直被封存。

起诉书指称，塞勒兹涅夫安装恶意软件，从各种零售商的电脑系统中盗窃信用卡号码，被盗商家包括美国西北部华盛顿州的餐馆和其它商家。

起诉书指控塞勒兹涅夫在2010年11月到2011年2月期间盗取了20多万个信用卡号码，并指控他及其同伙通过一个地下网站将其中的14万个号码转卖出去，从中获取大约200万美元的利润。

当局说，在电脑黑客圈，塞勒兹涅夫的绰号是“Track2”。

US Announces Arrest of Russian National in Credit Card Theft Scam

U.S. officials say a Russian national is in custody on charges linked to the theft and resale of tens of thousands of consumer credit card numbers.

The suspect, identified as 30-year-old Roman Valerevich Seleznev, appeared Monday in a U.S. court in Guam, where he was ordered held while awaiting another hearing July 22.

The U.S. Justice Department provided no details on the circumstances of Seleznev's arrest. But authorities say he was charged in a secret 2011 indictment that remained sealed until his capture Saturday at an undisclosed location.

That indictment alleges Seleznev installed malicious software to steal credit card numbers from an array of retail computer systems, including restaurants and other outlets in the northwestern U.S. state of Washington.

It accuses Seleznev of stealing more than 200,000 credit card numbers between November 2010 and February 2011. It also alleges he and his partners sold 140,000 of those numbers on underground websites, in a scheme that generated about $2 million in profits.

Authorities say Seleznev is known as "Track2" in the computer hacking world.

**NFL解决方案**

因多年脑部受撞击而留下伤残的前“美国国家橄榄球联盟”（NFL）球员星期一得到了好消息。一名联邦法官在有关求偿案中做出了对他们有利的裁决。

在作出这项裁决的大约两个星期前，NFL同意取消脑伤最高伤害索赔不得超过6亿7千5百万美元的封顶。这些脑伤包括大脑损伤和痴呆。

两万多名退役球员如今可以就这项解决方案进行表决。代表4千5百多名前球员的律师之前对NFL提起了诉讼。

费城的联邦法官说，新的“无封顶”的解决方案确保有足够的款项，可以通过这项期限为65年的方案为所有的补偿要求支付资金并改善诊断方式，以防欺诈。

NFL一名高层负责人称这项决定是全面性的，并说，NFL将与原告合作，落实有关条款。出现严重神经系统问题的退役球员有可能得到一百万美元甚至更多的补偿。

NFL Settlement

Former players of the U.S. National Football League (NFL) suffering from years of hard hits to the head got good news Monday when a federal judge ruled in their favor on compensation claims.

The ruling comes about two weeks after the NFL agreed to remove a $675 million cap on damages for head injury claims, including brain damage and dementia.

More than 20,000 retired players can now vote on the settlement. Lawyers for more than 4,500 former players had sued the league.

The federal judge in Philadelphia argued that the new "uncapped" settlement "ensures that there are sufficient funds available to pay all claims through the 65-year term of the settlement, and improves the manner in which diagnoses are made to protect against fraud."

A top NFL official called the decision comprehensive and said the league will work with the plaintiffs to implement the terms. Retired players who have or develop profound neurological problems could receive $1 million or more.
