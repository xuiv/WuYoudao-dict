**预计塞西将赢得埃及总统选举**

埃及总统选举正在进行第二天、也就是最后一天的投票，预计前陆军参谋长塞西将当选总统。

埃及总理马赫拉布星期二宣布将星期二定于全国假日，以便更多的人参加投票。

正式计票结果下星期才能揭晓，但人们广泛认为塞西很可能赢得选举。参加这次总统选举只有两名候选人，另一个是左翼政治家萨巴希。

在塞西主导下，埃及军方去年7月罢黜了穆尔西总统，从而引发穆尔西所属的穆斯林兄弟会举行抗议，军方对抗议者进行暴力镇压，造成1千多人死亡。多名穆兄会领导人被逮捕。塞西说，这个伊斯兰组织在埃及没有前途。

穆兄会号召埃及民众抵制选举，声称这次选举是非法的。

Sissi Expected to Win as Egyptians Cast Final Presidential Votes

Egyptians are voting for a second and final day in a presidential election that is expected to bring former army chief Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi to power.

Prime Minister Ibrahim Mahlab declared Tuesday a public holiday in a push for more people to go to the polls.

Official results are not due to come out until next week, but Sissi has long been considered the likely winner in a race with leftist politician Hamdeen Sabahi as the only other candidate.

Sissi led the army's ouster of former president Mohamed Morsi last July, setting off protests from Mr. Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood and a violent military crackdown that left more than 1,000 people dead. Many of the Brotherhood's leaders have also been arrested and Sissi says the Islamist group has no future in Egypt.

The Brotherhood urged Egyptians to boycott what the group says is an illegitimate election.


**越南：中国船撞沉一艘越南渔船**

越南说，一艘中国船在南中国海有争议水域撞沉一艘越南渔船，地点在北京安置的一个石油钻井平台附近。

河内海事官员说，这艘越南渔船星期一在距离中国石油钻井平台大约30公里的水域被中国渔船撞沉后，船上10名渔民都已获救。

事件发生后，一名中国政府官员对新华社说，这艘越南渔船星期一下午五点左右对一艘中国渔船进行骚扰，两船发生碰撞，随后越南渔船翻沉。

自中国5月1日将石油钻井平台安置在河内视为越南经济专属区的水域以来，越南和中国的船只屡次发生碰撞。

越南渔业监督局副局长黎霞对美国之音说，中国船只星期日的水炮攻击造成四名越南渔业官员受伤。

Chinese Ship Ram, Sink Vietnamese Fishing Boat: Vietnam

Vietnam says a Chinese vessel has rammed and sunk a Vietnamese fishing boat in the disputed South China Sea, near where Beijing has placed an oil rig.

Hanoi maritime officials say 10 fishermen had to be rescued after their boat was struck Monday by the Chinese fishing vessel, about 30 kilometers from where Beijing has stationed the rig.

A Chinese government official later told the state-run Xinhua news agency that the Vietnamese boat "capsized after harassing and colliding with a Chinese fishing boat" around 5 pm local time Monday.

Vietnamese and Chinese boats have repeatedly clashed since China moved the rig on May 1 to an area within what Hanoi considers its exclusive economic zone.

Ha Le, the Deputy Head of the Vietnam Fisheries Surveillance Department, told VOA's Vietnamese service that four fisheries officers were wounded Sunday after being hit by water cannons from Chinese vessels.
