**联合国官员称击落马航班机可能是战争罪**

联合国人权事务高级专员皮莱星期一指出，马航17次航班在反政府武装控制的乌克兰东部被击落，这种行为违反了国际法，可能等同于“战争罪”。她呼吁对此事展开“迅速、彻底、有效、独立和公正的调查”。

皮莱说，要尽一切努力，使在乌克兰冲突中严重违反国际法、包括犯有“战争罪”的任何人绳之以法，“不管他们是什么人”。

与此同时，坠机地点附近的战斗迫使国际调查员连续第二天放弃前往现场的计划。荷兰和澳大利亚专家星期一早些时候说，他们将再次尝试进入坠机现场。

在另外一方面，美国国务院星期天公布卫星图像，证实了美国所说的俄罗斯军队越界向乌克兰东部地区发射了火箭弹和炮弹。

这些图像包含在星期天发表的一份四页长的文件中。图像显示美国分析人士所说的多管火箭发射器以及从俄罗斯境内发射的炮火。其他图像显示了乌克兰境内军事阵地附近的撞击坑。乌克兰政府军正与亲俄罗斯的分离分子在那里展开战斗。

俄罗斯还没有对这些图像作出反应。

UN: Downing of Flight 'May Be War Crime'

The U.N. high commissioner for human rights says the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in rebel-held eastern Ukraine "may amount to a war crime."

Pillay said every effort will be made to ensure that anyone committing serious violations of international law in the Ukraine conflict, "including war crimes" will be brought to justice, "no matter who they are."

Meanwhile, fighting in the area where the plane crashed has forced a team of international investigators to abandon plans to gain access to the site for a second straight day. The team of Dutch and Australian experts said earlier Monday the group was renewing efforts to reach the site.

In another development, the U.S. State Department released satellite images Sunday showing what it says is proof that Russian forces are firing rockets and artillery across the border into eastern Ukraine.

The images, released in a four-page document, show what U.S. analysts say are multiple rocket launchers and artillery fire coming from Russian territory. Other images show impact craters near military positions in eastern Ukraine, where government forces are battling pro-Russian separatists.

Moscow has not commented on the pictures.

**联合国安理会敦促加沙立即停火**

联合国安理会通过一项声明，敦促以色列和哈马斯立即无条件实行人道停火。

安理会星期一清晨通过的声明敦促冲突双方采取措施，实行“持久的、得到全面遵守的停火”，并呼吁该地区和世界各地所有有关方面支持这一行动。此外，声明还提到必须立即为加沙地带居民提供人道救援。

联合国安理会采取这一举措之前，冲突升级以来的近三个星期内已有数次停火归于破裂。

巴勒斯坦常驻联合国代表曼苏尔表示，他希望这项声明能够导向长期停火，但他指责安理会没有采取更有力的行动，即通过一项谴责以色列“侵略”的决议案。

以色列常驻联合国代表普罗索尔说，哈马斯向以色列境内发射了2千5百枚火箭弹。他重申，如果以色列没有遭到火箭弹袭击，就无需发动进攻。

普罗索尔说，安理会的声明没有明确提及哈马斯激进分子的火箭弹袭击和以色列的自卫权。

包括美国总统奥巴马在内的各国官员继续努力寻找实现加沙地带持久停火的途径。
UN Security Council Urges Immediate Gaza Cease-Fire

The U.N. Security Council has adopted a presidential statement supporting an "immediate and unconditional" humanitarian cease-fire between Israel and Hamas.

The measure presented early Monday urges both sides in the conflict to take steps to achieve "a durable and fully respected cease-fire." It also expresses the need for immediate humanitarian aid to the people in the Gaza Strip.

The Council's action comes after several cease-fire agreements failed to hold since the conflict escalated nearly three weeks ago.

Palestinian Ambassador to the U.N. Riyad Mansour said he hopes the statement leads to a long cease-fire, but criticized the Security Council for not taking the stronger action of adopting a resolution against what he called Israel's "aggression."

Israeli Ambassador to the U.N. Ron Prosor said Hamas has fired 2,500 rockets at Israel, and reiterated that if Israel were not facing rocket attacks, it would not need to carry out its own strikes.

He said the Security Council statement was lacking in the specific mention of Hamas, militant rocket fire or Israel's right to defend itself.

Officials including U.S. President Barack Obama have continued to try to find a lasting halt to the fighting.
