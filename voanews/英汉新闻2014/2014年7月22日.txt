**假推特帐号散布中国当局的西藏宣传**

一个人权组织表示，该组织发现了至少100个假推特帐号在散布中国政府有关西藏的宣传。

自由西藏组织发现这些推特帐号经常使用编造拙劣的西方人姓名，并配有照片，包括专业摄影师拍摄的美国女学生照片。还有一些推特帐号使用商业资料图像或已故名人的照片。

总部设在伦敦的自由西藏组织说，这些推特发布英语文章，攻击达赖喇嘛，并把西藏描绘成一个心满意足、田园般的中国省份。

中国当局竭力描绘一幅西藏稳定的景象。自2009年以来，西藏有130多人为抗议北京的统治而自焚。中国当局指责达赖喇嘛煽动自焚，而达赖喇嘛否认这一指称。

中国政府没有对自由西藏的有关报告作出反应。自由西藏是与《纽约时报》合作进行调查的。

Fake Twitter Accounts Spreading Chinese Propaganda on Tibet

A human rights group says it has uncovered at least 100 fake Twitter accounts used to spread the Chinese government's propaganda about Tibet.

The accounts, found by Free Tibet, often used awkwardly constructed Western names and were accompanied by profile pictures that included photographs of American schoolgirls taken by professional photographers. Others used commercial stock images or pictures of dead celebrities.

The London-based rights group says the accounts posted English-language articles that attacked the Dalai Lama and that portrayed Tibet as a "contented and idyllic Chinese province."

China has gone to great lengths to paint a picture of stability in Tibet, where over 130 people have set themselves on fire since 2009 to protest Beijing's rule. It blames the Dalai Lama for inciting the self-immolations, a charge he rejects.

The Chinese government has not responded to the allegations found in the report by Free Tibet, which worked with the New York Times in its investigation.

United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry are continuing meetings with officials in the Middle East in a bid to bring an end to fighting between Israel and Hamas.

The two-week-old conflict showed no sign of slowing Tuesday, as Israeli airstrikes struck multiple targets in the Gaza Strip, killing at least 10 people, while rockets from Gaza flew into Israel.

Kerry met early Tuesday with Palestinian intelligence chief Majid Faraj before holding talks with Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shukri.

Both Kerry and Shukri said they hoped to not only achieve a cease-fire, but also move forward with the larger Israeli-Palestinian peace process.

Mr. Ban, who has urged both sides to immediately halt the violence and start negotiations without preconditions, is due to travel to Israel for a meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and to the West Bank to talk with Palestinian officials.
