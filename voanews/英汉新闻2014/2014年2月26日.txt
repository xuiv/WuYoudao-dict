**美国大使就人权批评中国**

即将离任的美国驻中国大使骆家辉星期三以大使身份发表最后一次讲话，敦促北京加强法制，提供更多言论自由。
骆家辉在北京对中国大学生发表演讲时说，在很多情况下，中国只需要依照现行法律来保障基本人权。
现年63岁的骆家辉将于星期六离开北京。他从2011年开始担任驻华大使，这是美国最复杂的外交使命之一，当时美中两国之间的紧张关系加剧。
在星期三的演讲中，骆家辉多次着重谈到美国关注中国当局加紧镇压批评中共的人士。
骆家辉还敦促北京为外国记者提供更好、更合理的待遇。很多外国记者抱怨说，他们由于自己的报道而受到干预或官方的报复。
中国没有对这些评论做出反应，但通常都将这类评论视为不正当地干涉中国内政，并声称华盛顿不应把所谓的“西方管理模式”强加给其他国家。

US Ambassador Slams China on Rights

Outgoing U.S. Ambassador to China Gary Locke used his final speech in office Wednesday to urge Beijing to strengthen its rule of law and provide greater freedom of expression.

Speaking to a group of Chinese university students in Beijing, Locke said in many cases China would need only to adhere to its existing laws in order to protect fundamental human rights.

The 63-year-old Locke leaves Beijing Saturday. He has served as ambassador since 2011, filling one of America's most complicated diplomatic posts at a time of increased tension with Beijing.

Many of Locke's comments Wednesday focused on U.S. concerns over China's intensifying crackdown on those who criticize the Communist Party.

He also urged Beijing to provide "better and more equitable treatment" of foreign journalists, many of whom complain of interference or official retribution as result of their coverage.

China has not responded to the comments, but usually dismisses such concerns as inappropriate interference in its internal affairs and says Washington should not be pushing its so-called Western style of governance on other countries.

**香港一位总编被砍成重伤**

香港明报前总编刘进图被身份不明的袭击者砍成重伤。他最近被报社免职一事，引发反对北京的抗议。
香港警方说，刘进图星期三凌晨在西湾河地区走向自己的汽车时遭到袭击，袭击者驾驶一辆摩托车逃逸。刘进图目前伤势严重。
刘进图上月被免去明报总编职务，该报以探索真相和直言报道北京政治而著称。一名亲北京人士接任明报总编。
刘进图被免职以及其他几个类似事件，使得民众担忧香港的新闻自由不断削弱以及大陆的影响力不断增大。
香港记者协会以最强烈的措辞谴责对刘进图的袭击，并敦促当局尽快将袭击者绳之以法，以减轻人们的恐惧。

Hong Kong Editor Stabbed; in Critical Condition

A former newspaper editor in Hong Kong, whose recent removal prompted anti-Beijing protests, is fighting for his life after being stabbed by unknown attackers.

Hong Kong police say Kevin Lau was walking to his car early Wednesday in the Sai Wan Ho neighborhood when he was attacked by assailants who escaped on a motorcycle. He is in critical condition.

Lau was fired last month as the editor of the Ming Pao newspaper, which is known for its investigative journalism and hard-hitting coverage of Chinese politics. He was replaced by a pro-Beijing editor.

The removal, along with several similar cases, have raised fresh concerns over deteriorating press freedom and mainland China's rising influence in the semi-autonomous territory.

The Hong Kong Journalists Association condemned the attack on Lau "in the strongest terms" and urged authorities to bring the attackers to justice "as quickly as possible to allay public fears."
