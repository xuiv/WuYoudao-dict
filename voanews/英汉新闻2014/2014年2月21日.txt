**美陆军首脑：美中有“共同目标”**

美国陆军参谋长奥迪尔诺上将在北京会见中国将军们时保证，双方将就“共同目标”展开更多对话。

星期五，奥迪尔诺上将在中国国防部受到正式迎接。

在奥迪尔诺上将访华之际，美国批评中国在东海及南海领土争端问题上对邻国的政策。

但奥迪尔诺上将在闭门会议开始之前表示，他将把注意力集中在双方共同关心的问题上。

中国的王宁中将也表示，中美军方对话是中美关系中的一个重要组成部分。

尽管美中两国在公开会谈中一直强调合作，看来两国间的紧张和不信任程度正在增长。

一名美国高层外交官本月早些时候敦促北京“澄清或修正”在南中国海的广泛主权要求。中国的很多邻国指责北京行事咄咄逼人。

Top US Army Officer: We Have 'Common Objectives' With China

The U.S. Army's top officer pledged more dialogue on "common objectives" as he met Chinese generals in Beijing.

Army Chief of Staff Ray Odierno was greeted Friday with full military honors at China's Defense Ministry.

His visit comes amid U.S. criticism of China's policies toward its neighbors over territorial claims in the East and South China Seas.

But before holding closed-door meetings, Odierno said he would focus on concerns that both sides share.

Chinese Lieutenant General Wang Ning also said military-to-military dialogue is an important part of the U.S.-China relationship.

Though both sides have stressed cooperation in public bilateral meetings, tensions and mistrust appear to be increasing.

A top U.S. diplomat earlier this month called on Beijing to "clarify or amend" its vast claims to the South China Sea, where many of China's neighbors accuse Beijing of acting aggressively.

**奥巴马总统周五将在白宫会晤达赖喇嘛**

美国总统奥巴马星期五将在白宫会晤流亡的西藏精神领袖达赖喇嘛。中国发表声明，对此表示严重关切。

白宫星期四晚间说，奥巴马将把达赖喇嘛作为“一位受尊敬的宗教及文化领袖”来与他会晤。

白宫的声明说，美国支持达赖喇嘛的“中间路线”，即藏人既不为汉人所同化，也不脱离中国而独立。

中国外交部迅速做出反应，敦促美国取消这次会晤，声称这种会晤属于粗暴干涉，将严重损害中美关系。

北京将达赖喇嘛视为危险的分裂主义者，声称他要为藏人自焚事件负责。达赖喇嘛否认这一指称。

美国承认西藏是中国的一部分。美国不支持西藏独立，同时担忧它所说的中国藏区的人权状况恶化。

白宫敦促中国政府在不设先决条件的情况下与达赖喇嘛或其代表重新展开对话。

Obama to Host Dalai Lama at White House

U.S. President Barack Obama will meet the Dalai Lama Friday at the White House, prompting a statement of "serious concern" from China.

The White House said late Thursday that Mr. Obama is meeting the Dalai Lama "in his capacity as a respected religious and cultural leader."

A statement said the U.S. supports the Dalai Lama's so-called "middle way" approach of neither assimilation nor independence for Tibetans in China.

China's foreign ministry quickly urged the U.S. to cancel the meeting, calling it a "gross interference" that will "seriously damage" U.S.-China ties.

Beijing views the Dalai Lama as a dangerous "splittist" who has encouraged a wave of self-immolations by Tibetans. He denies the charge.

The U.S. recognizes Tibet to be a part of China. While Washington does not back Tibetan independence, it is concerned over what it says is the deteriorating human rights situation in Tibetan areas of China.

The White House calls on China to reopen talks with the Dalai Lama or his representatives with no preconditions.
