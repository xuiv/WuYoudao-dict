**俄总理率团访问克里米亚 讨论当地发展问题**

俄罗斯总理梅德韦杰夫在克里米亚访问，他是俄罗斯3月早些时候吞并乌克兰的克里米亚之后去当地访问的最高级的俄罗斯官员。

梅德韦杰夫说，他率领的俄罗斯官员代表团将讨论他所谓的克里米亚发展问题。他宣布俄罗斯将在克里米亚建立特别经济区，通过减少税收和简化规章制度来刺激工商业发展。他还承诺给克里米亚人提高工资和退休金。

**Russian PM Medvedev in Crimea to Talk About Its 'Development' **

Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev is in Crimea - the most senior Russian to visit the region since Russia seized it from Ukraine earlier this month.

Mr. Medvedev says he is leading a delegation of Russian officials for a meeting on what he calls the "development" of the peninsula.

The prime minister says Russia will create a special economic zone in Crimea, offering incentives for business with lower taxes and simpler rules. Mr. Medvedev also promised to boost salaries and pensions in Crimea.

His meeting Monday comes a day after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry demanded Russia pull back thousands of its troops massed along the eastern and southern Ukrainian border.

Kerry told Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Paris Sunday that the troops are creating a "climate of fear" in Ukraine and that their presence does nothing for diplomacy.

**Kerry in Israel in Push to Keep Peace Talks Going**

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry arrived in Israel Monday in a new effort to try to prevent the collapse of peace talks with the Palestinians.

This time, the top U.S. diplomat plans to meet separately with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and again with the Palestinian leader.
