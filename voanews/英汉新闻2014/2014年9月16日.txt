**菲律宾马荣火山可能喷发 居民撤离**

菲律宾开始在本国最活跃的火山附近强制疏散居民。有关官员警告说，这座火山冒出红光，可能很快就会喷发。

有关当局说，马荣火山近来地震和落石增多，意味着可能在数周内发生大规模喷发。

马荣火山6公里之内的所有居民都在撤离。军人们不准被疏散的居民回家。

2460米的马荣火山位于马尼拉市以南约340公里的阿尔拜省。马荣火山以其圆锥形而闻名。

在以往数百年间，马荣火山曾喷发数十次。最大规模的喷发是在1814年，当时火山灰掩埋了卡格沙瓦镇，造成1200人死亡。

2013年5月，5名登山者在马荣火山峰顶附近遭遇火山灰而遇难。

Philippines Warns Mount Mayon Could Erupt, Begins Evacuation

The Philippines has begun a forced evacuation of residents near the country's most active volcano, which officials warn is glowing red and could soon erupt.

Authorities said Tuesday a recent increase in volcanic earthquakes and rockfalls at Mount Mayon means there could be a hazardous eruption "within weeks."

Anyone living within six kilometers of the volcano is being evacuated. Soldiers are preventing those who have left from returning to their homes.

The 2,460-meter Mount Mayon, which is located about 340 kilometers south of Manila in Albay province, is known for its picturesque conical shape.

It has erupted dozens of times in the last several hundred years. The most violent eruption occurred in 1814, when lava buried the town of Cagsawa, killing 1,200 people.

In May 2013, five climbers were killed near the summit after the volcano spewed ash on them.
