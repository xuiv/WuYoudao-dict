**Court Orders Government to Lift Musharraf's Travel Ban**

A Pakistani court has ordered the government to lift a travel ban on former military ruler Pervez Musharraf, who faces charges of treason.

The court, on Thursday, approved Mr. Musharraf's request to have his name removed from an Exit Control List.

The former military ruler has said he wants to visit his sick mother in Dubai.

In March, Mr. Musharraf was indicted for treason.

**UN, US Assess Situation in Iraq**

The United Nations Security Council is set to meet Thursday to discuss the situation in Iraq, where Islamist militants have seized several cities in a blow to the Shi'ite-led government.

Ahead of the session, the council issued a statement strongly criticizing the militants from the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) for their attack on Mosul. The members said "no act of violence or terrorism" can reverse Iraq's path toward peace and democracy.

Meanwhile, the United States is weighing how to help Iraq counter the surge by the militants who now control Mosul, Tikrit and Fallujah.

U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said one of the range of options under consideration is whether to send drones to Iraq.

White House Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the U.S. will continue giving Iraq "all appropriate assistance" to fight the al-Qaida offshoot ISIL, but did not give details of specific aid.
