**奥巴马派遣275名军方人员前往伊拉克**

美国总统奥巴马下令派遣275名军方人员前往伊拉克，帮助为美国驻巴格达使馆及使馆中的美国人员提供安全保障。

奥巴马星期一告知国会，这一举措已经得到伊拉克政府的同意。

奥巴马总统排除了向伊拉克派遣地面部队的可能性，他星期一会见国家安全班子成员，研究其他选择方案。

这些方案包括可能对逊尼派激进分子发动空袭。逊尼派激进分子已经控制了伊拉克北部很多地区，并誓言从什叶派主导的政府手中夺取巴格达。

此外，美国还考虑与伊朗合作。但五角大楼表示，目前尚未计划与伊朗方面就伊拉克境内的行动进行军事合作。

一名美国国务院高层官员说，美国和伊朗外交官星期一在维也纳核问题会议期间进行了短暂会晤。这位官员说，与伊朗方面的会谈不会涉及军事合作问题。

**Obama Sending 275 US Military Personnel to Iraq**

President Barack Obama has ordered 275 U.S. military personnel to Iraq to help provide security to the embassy in Baghdad and U.S. personnel there.

Mr. Obama's notification to Congress Monday says the move has the consent of the Iraqi government.

While the president has ruled out sending ground forces back into Iraq, he met with his national security team Monday to consider other options.

They include possible air strikes against the Sunni militants who already control large parts of northern Iraq and have vowed to seize Baghdad from the Shiite-led government.

The U.S. also is considering working with Iran. But the Pentagon says it has no plans to enter into military cooperation with the Iranians in any action in Iraq.

A top State Department official says U.S. and Iranian diplomats met briefly Monday on the sidelines of nuclear talks in Vienna. The official says talks with the Iranians will not include any discussion of military coordination.

**乌克兰总统命令军队夺回边界控制权**

乌克兰总统波罗申科说，他已经命令军队本周采取果断行动，重新夺取乌克兰-俄罗斯边界地区的控制权。

波罗申科星期一对高级安全官员讲话时说，他希望军事推进不超过一个星期。他表示，这将为与亲俄分裂分子实现停火并举行和谈创造条件。

波罗申科说，乌克兰部队已经夺回了边界地区百分之10以上的控制权，并部署了检查站，以阻止俄罗斯军械流入乌克兰。

波罗申科讲话前的几个小时，俄罗斯能源巨头俄罗斯国家天然气公司以基辅在最后期限前未能支付将近20亿美元的能源债务为由，切断了对乌克兰的天然气供应。

星期一，乌克兰没有表现出软化立场的迹象。乌克兰称目前有近140亿立方米地下天然气储备，能够满足12月之前的需求。

**Ukraine President Promises to Regain Control of Frontier**

Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko says he has ordered the army to take "decisive actions" this week to regain control of the Ukrainian-Russian frontier.

In an address Monday to top security officials, Mr. Poroshenko said he expects the military push to last no more than a week, and he said it will pave the way for a truce and peace talks with pro-Russian separatists.

He also said Ukrainian troops have regained control of a little more than 10 percent of the border, and that checkpoints are in place aimed at stopping the flow of Russian military hardware into his country.

The Poroshenko address came hours after Russian energy giant Gazprom cut natural gas shipments to its energy dependent neighbor, after Kyiv missed a deadline to paydown a nearly $2 billion energy debt.

Ukraine, which showed no public signs Monday of softening its demands, says it has almost 14 billion cubic meters of gas in underground storage -- enough to meet its needs until December.
