China, Vietnam Discuss Oil Rig Dispute

Chinese and Vietnamese officials meeting in Hanoi are expressing a willingness to improve ties strained by a dispute over an oil rig Beijing recently placed in contested waters off Vietnam's coast.

The comments on Wednesday came as both sides held their first high-level talks since the May deployment of the state-run oil rig, which led to a maritime standoff and deadly anti-China protests in Vietnam.

Vietnam's Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh confirmed Wednesday the dispute in the South China Sea, known to Vietnam as the East Sea, will be a focus of his meeting with Chinese State Councillor Yang Jiechi.

Yang acknowledged that the dispute is damaging relations between the two communist-led countries, which fought a bloody, three-week border battle in 1979.

After meeting with Foreign Minister Minh, Yang is scheduled to meet Vietnam's Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung, as well as Nguyen Phu Trong, the head of Vietnam's Communist Party.
