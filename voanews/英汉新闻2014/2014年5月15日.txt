Vietnam Rioting Kills 1 Chinese Worker

A riot at a Taiwanese steel plant in Vietnam has killed a Chinese worker, as thousands across the country protest against a Chinese oil rig in disputed waters of the South China Sea.

Officials said Thursday the riot in central Vietnam's Ha Tinh province was the first deadly incident in a wave of anti-Chinese protests. Thousands have walked off their jobs and rampaged through foreign-owned factories, injuring around 100 people.

In southern Binh Duong province, mobs torched and looted more than a dozen factories, including some owned by Korean and Taiwanese firms.

Many factories in the area were closed Wednesday as riot police tried to regain control of the situation.

Tsai Wan-chen, president of the Taiwanese Businessmen Association in Binh Duong, Vietnam, says the situation is still volatile, despite reports of police making more than 200 arrests.

'Friends of Syria' Seeking Ways to Push Political Solution to Crisis

Foreign ministers from 11 nations that support the Syrian opposition are meeting Thursday in London, as they try to figure out how to advance a political solution to the country's crisis and get aid in the hands of those affected by years of civil war.

The meeting hosted by British Foreign Minister William Hague brings together the core of the so-called Friends of Syria. His office says the diplomats will discuss how to "significantly" increase support for those demanding Syrian President Bashar al-Assad leave office.

International efforts to end the fighting in Syria have stalled, most notably with the failure of direct peace talks between the warring sides earlier this year.

Stephane Dujarric, a spokesman for United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, said Wednesday the U.N. chief is "disappointed" with the lack of progress.
