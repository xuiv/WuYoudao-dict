**China Jails Three Anti-Corruption Activists **

A court in central China has given jail terms of up to six and a half years to three activists who were part of a group urging government officials to disclose their assets.

The sentences handed down by a court in the central province of Jiangxi were the harshest yet in Beijing's year-long crackdown on the New Citizens Movement.

Liu Ping and Wei Zhongping were sentenced to six and a half years in jail after being found guilty of "disrupting public order" and "using an evil cult to undermine law enforcement." Li Sihua was given three years in jail for "disrupting public order."

That information came from Zhou Ze, a lawyer for the defendants, who said the activists must now decide whether to appeal the sentences.

China has arrested about a dozen members of the New Citizens Movement, a loosely organized group focused on corruption and civil rights.


**西班牙王储菲利普周四继承王位**


西班牙王储菲利普星期四将继承他父亲卡洛斯的王位，成为新国王，西班牙就此进入一个新时期。

星期四的王位交接仪式将是简单而低调的。西班牙官员说，王室了解目前西班牙正陷于经济衰退，失业率高达25%，在这种情况下，举行盛大仪式不合时宜。

现年76岁卡洛斯国王在位将近40年，星期三正式逊位。

迫使卡洛斯国王逊位的因素包括健康问题以及丑闻，包括1912年在非洲猎象之旅，当时正是西班牙经济危机最严重的时刻。

卡洛斯于1975年登上王位，当时的军事独裁者佛朗哥在临终前决定恢复王室的地位。

**Spain's Crown Prince Felipe to Ascend to Throne**


Spain enters a new era Thursday when Crown Prince Felipe will be sworn in as the new king, taking over for his father, Juan Carlos.

Thursday's handover will be simple and low-key. Spanish officials say the royal family is mindful that in a country struggling with a recession and 25% unemployment, an extravagant ceremony would be out of place.

The 76-year-old Juan Carlos formally abdicated the throne Wednesday after nearly 40 years.

Forcing him to give up power are health problems and scandal, including an elephant hunting trip to Africa in 2012 while Spain was at the height of its economic crisis.

Juan Carlos rose to power in 1975 when longtime military dictator Francisco Franco restored the Spanish monarchy just before his death.
