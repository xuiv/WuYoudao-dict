巴基斯坦官员说，死于空袭的人中包括重要的恐怖组织指挥官，但官员没有向媒体透露姓名。

**Pakistan Air Strike Kills at least 50**

Airstrikes in Pakistan's restive North Waziristan tribal region have killed at least 50 people.

Officials tell VOA the Pakistani military targeted confirmed militant hideouts Wednesday in Mir Ali and Miranshah, the main town of North Waziristan near the Afghan border.

Officials speaking to the media did not disclose names, but said important terrorist commanders were among those killed in the strikes.

Independent verification of the death toll is difficult as journalists are not allowed to enter the area.

North Waziristan is a known stronghold of the Taliban and other militants linked to al-Qaeda.


**泰国陆军司令将与政治对手举行会谈**

泰国陆军司令巴育在宣布实行戒严的一天后，呼吁相互敌对的政治派别举行会谈。

泰国选举委员会成员以及参议员们也将出席定于星期三下午举行的会议，争取找到摆脱政治危机的途径。

军人继续驻扎在曼谷的电视台、街道和抗议营地周围。一天前，泰国陆军出人意料地宣布实行戒严。

巴育说，在泰国最高法院以滥用权力为由罢免了英拉总理后，为了防止暴力，实行戒严是必要的。

泰国军方官员否认发动政变。他们向全国保证，政府正在宪法框架内充分运作。

但泰国政府内的消息人士对美国之音说，军方的命令已使文官政府失去执政能力。

联合国和美国政府都敦促泰国各方和平解决危机，尊重民主程序。

Thai Army Chief to Meet Political Rivals

Thailand's army chief, General Prayuth Chan-Ocha, has called for a meeting with the country's rival political groups, a day after he declared martial law.

Members of the election commission and senate will also take part in the Wednesday afternoon meeting, which aims to find a way out of the political crisis.

Soldiers remain camped outside television stations, on streets, and around protest sites in Bangkok, a day after the army unexpectedly declared martial law.

General Prayuth says the move was necessary to prevent violence after the country's top court ousted Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra for abuse of power.

Military officials deny they have staged a coup. They have assured the nation that the government is fully functioning within the constitution.

But Thai government sources tell VOA the military decrees have left the civilian government unable to function.

Both the United Nations and the White House are urging all sides in Thailand to resolve the crisis peacefully and to respect democracy.
