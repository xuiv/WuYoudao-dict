India's PM Visits Kashmir Amid Tight Security

India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi is urging residents in the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir to get out and vote in the local elections.

He praised the military for defending democracy and told a campaign rally in Samba town Monday, "now you must vote to safeguard their sacrifices.''

Mr. Modi also condemned a series of rebel attacks on Friday that killed 21 people, including 11 security personnel.

Sharpshooters have been posted on rooftops in the main city of Srinagar where the prime minister is scheduled to speak later Monday.
