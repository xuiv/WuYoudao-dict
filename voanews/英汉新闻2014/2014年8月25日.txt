Palestinians Say Israeli Airstrikes Kill 2 in Gaza

Palestinian officials say Israeli attacks early Monday killed two people in the Gaza Strip, as the conflict between the warring sides continued for a 49th day.

The Israeli military said it carried out 16 airstrikes Monday, including targeting two mosques in Gaza.

The fighting that erupted on July 8 has killed more than 2,100 Palestinians, most of them civilians, including close to 500 children. Sixty-four Israeli soldiers and four civilians have been killed.

The latest airstrikes come a day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Israelis to be prepared for the conflict to stretch into September, and warned residents in Gaza to leave sites where Hamas militants are operating. He said any site used by Hamas is a target for Israeli forces.


**巴育就任泰国总理**

泰国军政府领导人在得到国王普密蓬的认可后就任总理职位。

在曼谷星期一举行的仪式上，巴育将军接受了王室批准他就任总理的书面敕令。

在上星期四的议会选举中，军方主导的议会以压倒多数推选现年60岁的巴育出任总理。由于巴育是唯一的候选人，这一结果早在人们意料之中。

巴育将军5月2日迫使英拉总理的政府下台后，一直是军政府领导人。

巴育说，他下月将辞去陆军司令职务，并表示他计划在明年举行新选举之前一直担任总理。国王普密蓬星期一认可巴育就任总理，清除了有关组建临时政府的传言。

自从前总理他信2006年在一次军事政变中被赶下台以来，泰国一直处于政治动乱之中。巴育是那次政变的关键人物。他信是英拉的哥哥。

他信和英拉遭到曼谷传统政治精英的激烈反对。


Thai Junta Leader Becomes Prime Minister


Thailand's junta leader has become the new prime minister after receiving the endorsement of King Bhumibol Adulyadej.

General Prayuth Chan-ocha accepted a written royal command certifying his position at a ceremony in Bangkok Monday.

Last Thursday's overwhelming election of the 60-year-old army chief by the military-dominated legislature was a foregone conclusion, since he was the only candidate for the post.

General Prayuth has led the junta since forcing prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra's government out of power on May 22.

The general says he will step down as army chief next month, and says he plans to remain prime minister until new elections are held next year. Monday's endorsement by the king clears the say for the formation of an interim government.

Thailand has been plagued by political unrest since 2006 when former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, Ms. Yingluck's older brother, was ousted in a military coup in which General Prayuth was a key figure.

Mr. Thaksin and his sister were bitterly opposed by Bangkok's traditionalist political elite.
