**奥巴马：俄罗斯并吞克里米亚是虚弱的表现**

美国总统奥巴马说，俄罗斯并吞乌克兰的克里米亚是虚弱的表现，并不能显示其力量强大。

星期二海牙核安全问题峰会后，奥巴马对记者做出了上述表示。他说，国际社会永远不会承认俄罗斯对克里米亚的并吞，但他同时表示不大可能对此作出军事反应。

奥巴马说，华盛顿担心俄罗斯进一步侵入乌克兰。

美国、英国、加拿大、法国、德国、日本和意大利的领导人星期一说，在莫斯科改弦易辙之前，他们将暂停在八国集团内和俄罗斯的任何接触。

俄罗斯媒体援引克里姆林宫发言人的话说，俄罗斯愿意继续与八国集团成员国保持往来。

星期二，俄罗斯军队接管了乌克兰克控制的最后一个军事基地，满载乌克兰海军陆战队成员的客车从克里米亚撤离。

Obama: Russia Acting 'Out of Weakness' on Ukraine

U.S. President Barack Obama says Russia was acting "out of weakness" and not strength in its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.

In comments to reporters following a nuclear summit in The Hague Tuesday, Mr. Obama said the international community would never recognize Russia's takeover of Crimea, but he said a military response from the West was unlikely.

The U.S. leader said Washington is still concerned about "further encroachment" into Ukraine by Russia.

On Monday, leaders from the U.S. Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan said they were suspending their participation with Russia in the G8, until Moscow "changes course."

Russian news agencies quote a Kremlin spokesman as saying Russia is ready for and interested in continuing contacts with its fellow G8 countries.

Also Tuesday, Ukrainian marines began leaving Crimea by the busload as Russian forces took control of the last remaining military base under Ukrainian control.

**马航失联班机搜寻发现122个物体**

马来西亚说，一些卫星图像经过重新分析后显示，印度洋海面上有122个物体可能跟失踪马航班机有关。

马来西亚国防部长兼代理交通部长希山慕丁­·侯赛因星期三对记者说，这些可能是飞机残骸的物体是在法国3月23日拍摄的卫星图像上发现的。

他说，有些物体长一米，有些长23米，有的物体看上去很亮，可能是固体物质。他们在距离珀斯2557公里的海面上。

虽然希山慕丁强调还未证实这些物体就是失踪飞机的残骸，但是他说这一发展为调查提供了新的线索。

澳大利亚海事安全局星期三也说，搜索飞机又发现了三个物体。 海事安全局在推特上说， 这些飘浮物“可能是绳子”和“一个蓝色物体”。

海事安全局说，搜索飞机随后再飞越这处海域时没有重新看到这些物体。这些物体也没有独特的特征能够表明它们来自失踪班机。

搜索行动由于天气关系暂停24小时后重新恢复。目前，六个国家出动了至少12架飞机和两艘舰船继续在印度洋南部进行搜索。

122 Objects Spotted in Search for Malaysia Jet

Malaysia says newly analyzed satellite images show 122 possible objects that could be parts of a missing Malaysian airliner in the Indian Ocean.

Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters Wednesday the potential debris was located in French satellite photos taken on March 23.

"Some objects were a meter in length, others were up to 23 meters in length. Some of the objects appeared to be bright, possibly indicating solid material. The objects were located approximately 2,557 kilometers from Perth."

While stressing it is not yet confirmed the objects are parts of the missing aircraft, he said the development represents "another new lead" in the investigation.

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority also said Wednesday its search planes spotted three more objects in the area. On Twitter, the AMSA described the objects as "likely rope" and "a blue object."

The authority said none of the debris was relocated on further passes and that nothing was distinctive of Malaysia Airlines flight 370.

The news came as the search for the plane resumed, following a 24-hour delay because of bad weather. At least 12 planes and two ships from several are currently involved in the search.
