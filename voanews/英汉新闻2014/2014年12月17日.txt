North Korea Marks Three-Year Death Anniversary of Kim Jong Il

North Korea's communist leadership is marking the three-year anniversary of the death of ex-dictator Kim Jong Il.

State television on Wednesday showed North Koreans bowing and leaving flowers at the statue of the former leader and his father Kim Il Sung.

Horns from automobiles, ships, and trains rang out across the country at noon Wednesday to mark the death anniversary.

Top North Korean leaders participated in a ceremony later at the Kumsusan Palace, where the bodies of the two late Kims are preserved.

Pyongyang has worked hard to create a personality cult around the Kim family, which has now ruled North Korea for three generations.

Kim Jong Il died unexpectedly in December 2011. He passed power to his young son, Kim Jong Un, who has quickly solidified his rule.

Wednesday marks the end of a traditional three-year mourning period for the late Mr. Kim.

The young Mr. Kim has largely carried out the same policies as his father, including overseeing the advancement of the country's massive military.

He is also responsible for overseeing what U.N. officials recently described as human rights abuses that are "unparalleled" in the modern world.

**奥巴马签署2015年联邦政府开支法案**

美国总统奥巴马签署了一项1万1千亿美元开支法案，该法案将使美国联邦政府的几乎所有机构得以在2015年维持运作。

在奥巴马签署的这项法案中，唯一的例外是国土安全部，到明年2月底，国土安全部将没有运作经费。共和党领导人对国土安全部的经费加以限制，以迫使奥巴马总统撤销有关使美国境内数百万非法移民免予遣返的政令。

上星期，来自德克萨斯州的共和党参议员克鲁兹要求对一项提案进行表决，削减可能用做执行奥巴马政令的款项，此举曾使开支法案能否最终通过出现疑问。

以马萨诸塞州籍参议员沃伦为首的民主党议员曾威胁阻挠开支法案获得批准，理由是其中一项条款将削弱2010年通过的多德 - 弗兰克金融监管法规。

President Obama Signs 2015 Government Spending Bill

U.S. President Barack Obama has signed a $1.1 trillion bill that will fund nearly every federal government agency through 2015.

The only exception in the bill signed Tuesday by Mr. Obama is the Department for Homeland Security, which will run out of funding at the end of February. Republican leaders limited funding for the agency so it can force the president to reverse his executive order that removes the threat of deportations from millions of undocumented immigrants in the United States.

The bill's final passage was thrown in doubt last week when Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas demanded a vote on a proposal to cut funds that could be used to carry out Mr. Obama's executive order.

Congressional Democrats, led by Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, also threatened to scuttle the bill over a provision that would weaken parts of the Dodd-Frank financial sector regulation law passed in 2010.
