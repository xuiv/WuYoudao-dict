**俄罗斯支持乌克兰分离分子选举**

俄罗斯星期二宣布将承认东乌克兰两个分离分子占领地区的选举结果。

俄罗斯外长拉夫罗夫表示，定于11月2号举行的选举，对于没有得到国际间认可的“顿涅斯克和卢甘斯克共和国”的“权力合法化”来说很重要。

在乌克兰境内其他地方，人们在刚刚过去的这个星期天投票选举。但是在乌克兰东部地区，有近三百万选民没有参与投票。过去几个月来的乌克兰政府军和俄罗斯支持的分离主义者之间的交战已经导致三千七百多人丧生。

乌克兰东部的反叛领导人说要单独举行投票。由俄罗斯支持的东部分离人士在今年四月发动了反政府的攻势。

美国总统奥巴马星期一表示，美国不会承认由反叛分离人士在他们所控制地区所举行的选举的结果，除非选举符合乌克兰法律、并且在乌克兰政府同意的情况下进行的。

Russia to Recognize "People's Republic" Election Results

Russia announced Tuesday it will recognize the results of upcoming elections in two separatist regions of eastern Ukraine.

Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the voting scheduled for November 2 would be important for the "legitimization of power" in the unrecognized "People's Republics" of Donetsk and Luhansk.

While the rest of Ukraine headed to the polls on Sunday, nearly three million voters were unable to cast ballots in the eastern part of the country, where months of fighting between Ukrainian government forces and Russia-backed separatists has killed more than 3,700 people.

Eastern Ukraine's rebel leaders, who launched a rebellion against the Kyiv government in April, said they would conduct their own poll.

U.S. President Barack Obama said Monday that the United States will not recognize elections in separatist-controlled areas unless they comply with Ukrainian law and are held with the consent of the Ukrainian government.


**多伦多选出新市长 结束福特时代**

加拿大城市多伦多的选民选出了一名新市长。将卸任的多伦多市长福特由于吸毒、酗酒、以及在大庭广众下出言不逊等行为引发国内和国际的关注。

多伦多的市长选举在星期一举行。全部选票清点之后显示，保守派参选人约翰.托里胜出，赢得了40%多的选票，击败了参选的现任市长的兄弟，他获得了33%的选票。排名第三的参选人是一位被认为有左翼倾向的亚裔女性，邹至蕙。她获得了23%的选票。

在这次选举中获胜的托里曾经是一家有线电视公司的总裁，还担任过广播节目的主持人。他在2010年参选市长的时候，输给了当时的在职市长福特。

福特上个月宣布不再竞选连任。他被查出患有较严重的腹部肿瘤。之后，他和他的兄弟决定互换角色出来竞选，他的兄弟出来竞选市长，他本人竞选市议员。

尽管即将卸任的福特因吸毒等问题名声不好，但是他星期一发表讲话时暗示，下一届市长选举、也就是2018年的时候，他还有可能会参选。

Toronto Elects New Mayor, Ending Troubled Era of Rob Ford

Residents of Toronto, Canada have elected a new mayor to replace outgoing Mayor Rob Ford, who has garnered international headlines for his drug and alcohol use and publicly boorish behavior.

With 100 percent of the vote counted, conservative candidate John Tory won Monday's election with over 40 percent of vote, defeating Doug Ford, Rob Ford's brother, who gained 33 percent of the vote. A third candidate, left-leaning Olivia Chow, finished with just 23 percent.

Tory, a former cable television company executive and radio broadcaster, lost the 2010 mayoral race to the incumbent mayor.

Mayor Ford dropped his reelection bid last month after being diagnosed with an aggressive form of abdominal cancer, prompting the brothers to switch places - while Doug ran for mayor, Rob ran for Doug's seat on the city council.

Despite his notoriety, the outgoing mayor suggested Monday during a speech to his supporters that he will seek the top job again in 2018.
