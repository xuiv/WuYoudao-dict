**奥巴马内塔尼亚胡会谈 重点是伊核谈判**

美国总统奥巴马星期三在白宫与以色列总理内塔尼亚胡会谈，预计双方将集中讨论与伊朗的核谈判问题。

内塔尼亚胡几天前在联合国大会上发言指出，伊朗企图骗取国际社会取消对伊朗的制裁， 并允许伊朗发展核武器。

他警告说，伊朗拥有核武器之后会比活跃在伊拉克和叙利亚境内的伊斯兰国激进分子更危险。

伊朗一直声称其核项目是为了和平目的，并且说内塔尼亚胡的讲话说明以色列继续奉行“破坏和干扰”伊朗与世界大国谈判的政策。

伊朗与世界大国就达成一个全面协议的谈判原定7月结束，但双方同意将谈判延至11月24日。

Obama, Netanyahu to Meet with Focus on Iran

U.S. President Barack Obama hosts Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for talks Wednesday that are expected to focus on nuclear talks with Iran.

The meeting at the White House comes days after Mr. Netanyahu told the United Nations General Assembly that Iran is trying to trick the world into lifting sanctions while still allowing it to develop nuclear weapons.

He warned that a nuclear-armed Iran would be more dangerous than the Islamic State group operating in Iraq and Syria.

Iran has long insisted its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, and said Mr. Netanyahu's speech continued a policy to "sabotage and disrupt" the nuclear negotiations with world powers.

Those talks to reach a comprehensive agreement were due to end in July, but the two sides agreed to extend the process until a new November 24 deadline.


**日本因火山爆发死亡人数上升到48人**

星期三，日本救援人员又找到12具尸体，使得上星期六御岳山火山喷发造成的死亡人数增至48人。

长野县当局表示，这些遗体是在被火山灰覆盖的御岳山山峰附近找到的。火山喷发时，那里挤满了徒步旅行者。

成百上千名警察和军人在直升机的帮助下，继续在山上搜索。当局认为仍然有数目不详的人失踪。

御岳山星期六中午时分在没有预兆的情况下突然喷发，当时有数百人被困在山峰上。他们当中大多数人在星期六晚间下山。

幸存者当中很多都有遭受割伤，撞伤和骨折，可能是被火山喷发带起的石块击中造成的。有毒烟雾和再次喷发的威胁，使得搜索工作变得困难。

御岳山是秋季远足者喜爱的地方。这座座落在东京以西长野县和岐阜县交界处的火山上次喷发是在1979年。

Death Toll from Japan Volcano Rises to 48

The death toll from Saturday's massive volcanic eruption in central Japan has risen to 48, after rescuers found 12 more bodies on Wednesday.

Authorities in Nagano prefecture say the bodies were found near the ash-covered summit of Mount Ontake, which was packed with hikers at the time of the eruption.

Hundreds of police and soldiers aided by helicopters continue searching the mountain. Authorities believe an unknown number of people are still missing.

Hundreds of people were stranded on the peak after it erupted Saturday without warning around noon, local time. Most made their way down Saturday evening.

Many of the survivors suffered cuts, bruises and bone fractures, likely after being hit by rocks flying out of the volcano. Toxic fumes and the threat of further eruptions have complicated search efforts.

Mount Ontake is popular among hikers in the autumn. The volcano, which sits on the border of Nagano and Gifu prefectures west of Tokyo, had its last major eruption in 1979.
