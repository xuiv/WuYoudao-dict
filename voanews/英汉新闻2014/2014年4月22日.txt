美国选手凯夫莱齐吉赢得2014年波士顿马拉松冠军。成千上万旁观者在场欢呼助威。去年举行波士顿马拉松时，终点线附近发生两次爆炸，导致三人死亡，数百人受伤。

自从美国选手梅耶1983年获得波士顿马拉松冠军后，凯夫莱齐吉是第一位获得这项赛事冠军的美国人。这位出生厄立特里亚的美国人跑过终点线时挥拳以示庆祝。他用两小时8分37秒跑完全程。这是第118届波士顿马拉松比赛。第二名肯尼亚选手彻贝特比他慢了11秒。

肯尼亚选手杰普图第三次获得女子冠军，并创造了这项赛事的新纪录：两小时18分57秒。比杰普图慢了一分钟的埃塞俄比亚选手德巴获得第二名。

今年的参赛选手大为增多，大约3万六千人参加了比赛，其中包括在去年比赛中因发生爆炸而没有跑过终点线的六千人。

American Wins Boston Marathon

Meb Keflezighi won the 2014 Boston Marathon Monday before thousands of cheering spectators on hand in a show of defiance to last year's twin bombings near the finish line that killed three spectators and injured more than 260 others.

Keflezighi is the first American to win the legendary race since Greg Meyer in 1983. Pumping his fist in exhilaration, the Eritrean-born Keflezighi crossed the finish line Monday in 2 hours, 8 minutes, 37 seconds. In this 118th edition of the race, he beat runner-up Wilson Chebet of Kenya by 11 seconds.

Kenyan Rita Jeptoo won the women's race for the third time, with a record-breaking time of 2 hours, 18 minutes, 57 seconds. Ethiopian Buzunesh Deba finished second, just over a minute later.

This year's race included an expanded field of runners - 36,000, to include about 6,000 from last year who were not allowed to cross the finish line because of the bombings.

**美国：叙利亚境内可能发生化武袭击**

美国官员说，有迹象表明叙利亚反对派控制的一个地区本月曾发生化学毒气袭击。

白宫发言人卡尼星期一说，据称叙利亚西部卡弗尔吉塔村遇袭时出现了一种工业化学制剂，可能是氯气。

禁止化学武器组织正与联合国协作，努力清除叙利亚宣称拥有的化学武器。该组织本星期表示，叙利亚80%的化武已经移到境外或予以销毁。

美国国务院发言人莎琪星期一说，氯气没有列在叙利亚去年宣称拥有的化武清单上，当时叙利亚当局迫于国际社会的压力，同意销毁化武。

美国及其盟国说，阿萨德的军队去年使用了沙林毒气，造成数百平民死亡。叙利亚政府说，使用沙林毒气的是反政府武装。

US Investigating Possible Chemical Attack in Syria

U.S. officials say they have indications that toxic chemicals were used in a rebel area of Syria this month.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said Monday that the alleged attack in the western village of Kafr Zita involved an industrial chemical that was probably chlorine.

The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is working with the United Nations to rid Syria of its declared stockpile of such weapons. The OPCW said this week that 80 % of those chemicals have been removed from the country or destroyed.

U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Monday that chlorine was not on the list of chemicals that Syria declared last year when it agreed to destroy the arms under international pressure.

Washington and its allies say Mr. Assad's forces unleashed sarin gas last year, killing hundreds of civilians. The Syrian government said it was the opposition fighters who used the chemical weapons.
