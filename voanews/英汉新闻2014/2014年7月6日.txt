**国安局监控美国人网络通讯多于外国人**

美国一家主要报纸说，美国国家安全局在合法截获一些外国人网络通讯的4年期间，也收集了多达9倍的普通美国和非美国因特网使用者的通讯纪录。

华盛顿邮报星期六晚间在网站上发表的一个报道说，几乎一半的截获资料包括姓名、电邮地址或者其他信息，国安局标明是属于美国公民或居民的。

逃离美国、目前居住在俄罗斯的前国家安全局分析员斯诺登，向华盛顿邮报提供了这些截获文件的巨大的情报数据。

邮报说，在被截获的信息中发现了非常有情报价值的通讯，包括揭密一个秘密海外核项目、一个“表面盟国”的两面派做法、一个非友好强国的军事灾难，以及侵入美国电脑系统的咄咄逼人黑客的身份等等。

华盛顿的官员还没有立即对华盛顿邮报的这篇报道发表评论。

**Ordinary Americans Outnumber Foreigners in NSA Spy Sweep**

A report in a major U.S. newspaper says when the National Security Agency intercepted the online accounts of legally targeted foreigners over a four-year period, the agency also collected the conversations of nine times as many ordinary Internet users, both Americans and non-Americans.

The Washington Post, in a story posted on its website late Saturday, says nearly half of the surveillance files contained names, email addresses or other details the NSA marked as belonging to U.S. citizens or residents.

The huge trove of intercepted documents was provided to the Post by former NSA analyst Edward Snowden, who fled the United States and is now living in Russia.

The newspaper says there were "discoveries of considerable intelligence value" in the intercepted messages, including revelations about a secret overseas nuclear project, double-dealing by "an ostensible ally," an unfriendly power's military calamity, and the identities of aggressive intruders into U.S. computer networks.

Officials in Washington have made no immediate comment about the report.

**以色列空袭据信是巴人发射火箭场所**

以色列表示，星期天清晨对加沙地带的10个地点发动了空袭。这次空袭针对的是以色列军队所说的巴勒斯坦人向以色列发射火箭的地点。

在东耶路撒冷和其他城镇，以色列警察和巴勒斯坦抗议者之间的冲突已经持续了几天。自从3位以色列少年今年6月从约旦河西岸被劫持，后来发现被杀害后，局势一直非常紧张。以色列指责激进组织哈马斯劫持并杀害了以色列少年。

另外，巴勒斯坦司法官员说，对被怀疑是遭报复杀害的巴勒斯坦少年的尸检表明，他是被烧死的。在这位阿拉伯少年被劫持者塞进一辆汽车后大约一个小时后，他的被烧焦的尸体星期三在耶路撒冷一处森林被找到。

**Israel Strikes 10 Sites that Palestinians have launched rockets into Israel**

Israel says it carried out airstrikes Sunday on 10 sites in the Gaza Strip. The early morning operation targeted sites where the Israeli army says Palestinians have launched rockets into Israel.

Clashes between Israeli police and Palestinian protesters have been ongoing for several days in East Jerusalem and other towns. Tensions have been high since three Israeli teenagers were abducted from the West Bank in June and were later found dead. Israel blames the militant group Hamas for the kidnappings and murders.

The Palestinian attorney general says an autopsy on an Arab teenager killed in a suspected revenge attack shows he was burned to death. The charred body was found in a Jerusalem forest Wednesday about an hour after he was forced into a car by kidnappers.
