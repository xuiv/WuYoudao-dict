**美外交官拒绝对电话通话中涉欧盟言论置评**

美国外交官卢岚星期五拒绝就显然被窃听的私下谈话的内容发表评论。电话中的这个人对欧盟使用了贬低的语言。

卢岚星期五对记者说，她不会对“外交官之间的私下对话”发表评论。不过她称那段电话录音是“令人钦佩的间谍手法”，还说，录音的音频质量非常好。

美国官员暗示俄罗斯可能跟录音泄露有关，其中的声音听起来像是美国助理国务卿卢岚和美国驻乌克兰大使皮雅特。录音中的两人讨论了解决乌克兰当前政治危机的国际努力。听上去像卢岚的声音在通话中一度使用了不雅的字眼，说可以无视欧盟的立场。

美国官员星期四指出，始作俑者是俄罗斯副总理德米特里•罗戈津的一名助手，将这段录音上传到了YouTube网站。

罗戈津的助手罗斯库托夫星期五对美联社说，罗戈津和俄罗斯政府都跟这段录音的泄漏没有关联。

U.S. Diplomat: No Comment on Alleged EU Statement

U.S. diplomat Victoria Nuland refused to comment Friday on the leak of an apparently bugged private phone conversation in which the speaker makes a disparaging remark about the European Union.

Nuland told reporters Friday she will not comment on a "private diplomatic conversation." But she called the recording of the call "pretty impressive tradecraft," saying the audio quality of the recording was very good.

U.S. officials have implied Russia may be involved in the leak of the recording, which features voices resembling those of Assistant Secretary of State Nuland and U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt. The people on the alleged call discuss international efforts to resolve Ukraine's ongoing political crisis, and at one point, the voice resembling Nuland's uses vulgar wording to suggest the European Union's position should be ignored.

U.S. officials on Thursday pointed to a tweet by an aide to Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin as the first to promote the recording, which appeared on the YouTube website.

An aide to Rogozin, Dmitry Loskutov, told the Associated Press on Friday that neither Rogozin nor the Russian government played a role in leaking the tape.
