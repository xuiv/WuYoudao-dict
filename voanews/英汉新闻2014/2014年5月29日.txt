**Snowden Wants to Return to US**

Fugitive self-proclaimed spy and NSA secrets leaker Edward Snowden says he wants to return home to the United States.

In his first interview on U.S. television, Snowden told NBC-TV newsman Brian Williams Wednesday that he sees himself as a patriot, but that until he can return to the U.S. he plans to ask Russia to extend his asylum.

He sought to defend himself against charges by the Obama administration that he is a traitor who endangered lives by revealing the extent of an NSA spying program.

Asked whether he would make a deal to return, Snowden said he first wants to make "sure that these programs are reformed," and that the family and country he left behind can be helped by his actions.

**拜登：中国缺乏创新**

美国副总统拜登星期三就外交政策发表演讲，以打消人们对中国经济实力的担忧。
拜登对空军学院毕业生讲话时承认，中国的理工科毕业生人数是美国的六倍到八倍。
拜登说：“我敢说，你们说不出任何一项创新项目、创新变革以及创新产品是来自中国。”

拜登提到上世纪90年代。他说，当时很多美国人担心崛起的日本会抢走美国的饭碗，担心未来是日本的。

拜登暗示，中国已经取代日本，在经济上成为美国的新挑战对手，同时他表示希望中国和日本都获得成功。

人们广泛预计中国的国内生产总值将在几年内超越美国，成为世界第一大经济体。
尽管中国几十年来经济高速发展，中国经济面临着严重挑战，包括收入差距巨大、腐败和污染。

**Biden Slams China over Lack of Innovation**

U.S. Vice President Joe Biden used a speech on foreign policy Wednesday to dismiss concerns over China's economic strength.

Speaking to a group of Air Force graduates, Biden acknowledged China is "graduating six to eight times as many scientists and engineers as we have."

But he said: "I challenge you, name me one innovative project, one innovative change, one innovative product that has come out of China."

Biden referenced the 1990s, when he said many people in the U.S. feared a rising Japan would "eat our lunch, that Japan was the future."

He implied China has replaced Japan as the new economic challenger to the U.S., while noting he hopes both China and Japan succeed.

China is widely expected later this decade to overtake the U.S. as the world's biggest economy, in terms of gross domestic product.

But despite decades of rapid growth, China's economy faces huge challenges, including wide income inequality, corruption, and pollution.
