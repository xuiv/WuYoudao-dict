**搜寻马航失踪客机仍无结果**

集中在遥远的印度洋南部水域搜寻马航失踪客机努力进入第二天，但是目前还没有可靠证据显示卫星在该地区发现的两件物体来自于这架客机。

五架侦查机仔细搜索这片遥远的海域，这是多国参与的搜寻马航MH370航班工作的一部分。这架飞机3月8号失踪，机上共有239名乘客。

参加搜寻的侦察机分别来自澳大利亚、新西兰以及美国海军的一架飞机。马来西亚国防部表示，中国部署了多艘舰船和多架飞机。日本、英国和法国也提供了帮助，但是仍然需要更多的帮助。

这架客机在从吉隆坡飞往北京的途中失踪，到目前为止还没有发现失踪飞机的迹象或任何有关线索。

澳大利亚星期四公布了两个大型物体的卫星图像。调查人员说，它们可能是失踪班机的残片。其中一个物体长24米，另一个有五米长。

No Answers Yet in Search for Missing Malaysian Jet

The hunt for a missing Malaysian airliner focused on the southern Indian Ocean for a second day, but there is no evidence so far that two objects satellites spotted in the water came from the jet.

Five search planes were combing the remote area as part of an international effort to locate possible debris from Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370. The plane disappeared March 8 with 239 people on board.

The surveillance aircraft participating in the search include planes from Australia and New Zealand and one U.S. Navy plane.

Malaysia's defense minister ((Hishammuddin Hussein)) said China has also deployed multiple ships and aircraft, with Japan, Britain and France providing additional assistance. But more help is needed.

So far, there have been no signs of the missing plane or any firm clues as to what happened to it when it disappeared on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

Australia released satellite imagery Thursday showing two large objects investigators say could be part of the flight. One piece is about 24 meters long and another is five meters long.
