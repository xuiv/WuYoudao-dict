**印度查谟和克什米尔邦开始投票**

印度克什米尔的选民星期二参加第一阶段选举的投票。

出于安全考虑，投票站戒备森严。分离主义分子呼吁抵制这次选举。1989年以来，反政府组织一直为独立或与巴基斯坦合并而同印度军队作战。

印度总理莫迪所属的印度教民族主义党“印度人民党”争取控制由87名议员组成、穆斯林占多数的查谟和克什米尔邦议会。

印度人民党的官员说，如果赢得选举，将谋求让这个有争议的地区与印度完全成为一体。

查谟和克什米尔选举分五个阶段投票，选举结果将于12月23日揭晓。

Indian Kashmir election

Voters are casting ballots in the first stage of an election in Indian Kashmir.

Polling places were heavily guarded when they opened Tuesday because of security concerns. Separatists had called for a boycott of the election. Rebel groups have been fighting Indian forces for independence or a merger with Pakistan since 1989.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has made an aggressive effort to win control of the 87-member assembly in the Muslim-majority Jammu and Kashmir state.

Party officials say if it wins it will seek to fully integrate the disputed region with India.

Jammu and Kashmir will vote in five phases, with results expected on December 23.


**中国要求菲律宾释放9名被捕渔民**

中国要求菲律宾释放在南中国海有争议海域被捕的9名中国渔民。

这些人今年5月在半月礁被菲律宾警方逮捕，菲律宾法院这个星期判决他们偷猎珍稀海龟罪名成立，每人罚款大约10万美元。

中国外交部发言人华春莹星期二敦促马尼拉“无条件”释放这些人员与船只，并说这些渔民被菲律宾“非法逮捕”，“侵犯了中国的主权和行政管辖权”。

中国宣称对半月礁以及其他南中国海岛屿拥有主权。

今年稍早，菲律宾就中国的领海声索向联合国国际法庭提起诉讼。北京表示，不承认对于海洋主权争议的国际仲裁，并拒绝辩护或者参与司法过程。

越南、菲律宾、文莱、台湾、马来西亚和中国对南中国海所有或部分岛屿宣称拥有主权。

China Demands Philippines Release Fishermen Arrested in Disputed Waters

China is demanding that the Philippines release nine Chinese fishermen who were arrested in a part of the South China Sea claimed by both countries.

The fishermen, who were detained in May near the Half Moon Shoal, were fined this week $100,000 each for poaching an endangered species of sea turtle.

China's foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying on Tuesday urged Manila to "unconditionally release" the boat and the fishermen. Hua said the men and the boat were "illegally seized" by the Philippines, which she said "violated China's sovereignty and rights of administration."

China claims the Half Moon Shoal, along with nearly the rest of the South China Sea.

Earlier this year, the Philippines filed a challenge with a United Nations tribunal over China's maritime claims. Beijing says it does not recognize international arbitration of the dispute and has refused to defend itself or otherwise take part in the proceedings.

Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei and Malaysia all have overlapping territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea.
