**美国：朝鲜是索尼影业黑客事件主谋**

据媒体报道，美国已经确定是朝鲜策划了对索尼影业公司的网络入侵。索尼影业星期三决定取消发行一部虚构谋杀朝鲜领导人金正恩情节的影片。

未透露姓名的美国官员说，调查人员发现朝鲜与这起黑客行动有关，这起行动导致数万份文件泄露，并加剧了针对影片《采访》的恐怖袭击威胁。

目前还不清楚调查人员做出这一判断的根据，也不清楚白宫将如何做出反应。美国国家安全委员会说，联邦调查局领导进行这项调查，并将在适当时候提供进一步的信息。

索尼影业公司星期三早些时候表示，取消原定于12月25日的《采访》首映式，此前几家主要影院连锁院线都决定不上映这部影片。索尼影业发表声明说，该公司与这些影院有着同样的安全方面的担忧。索尼影业目前还没有关于这部影片首映式的计划。

一个自称“和平卫士”黑客组织星期二发表声明，威胁要让观看这部影片的人吃苦头。这份简短的声明用蹩脚的英文提到911袭击美国事件，并警告人们远离放映这部片子的影院。

US Says North Korea Behind Sony Cyber attack

Media reports say the U.S. has determined North Korea is behind the hacking of Sony Pictures, which gave in to security concerns and canceled the release of a film about a fictional plot to assassinate Pyongyang's leader, Kim Jong Un.

Speaking on condition of anonymity, U.S. officials said investigators have connected North Korea to the cyberattack. The massive breach has resulted in the leak of tens of thousands of documents and has escalated to threats of terrorist attacks over the film "The Interview."

It is not clear how investigators made the determination or how the White House will respond. The National Security Council said the FBI is leading the investigation and will "provide an update at the appropriate time."

Earlier Wednesday, Sony said it is scrapping the December 25 release of "The Interview," after several major theater chains chose not to show the film. The statement said Sony shared the theaters' safety concerns. It has no current plans to release the film.

A hacker group calling itself Guardians of Peace on Tuesday released a statement promising a "bitter fate" to those who attend showings of "The Interview." In broken English, the brief statement invoked the September 11, 2001 attacks on the U.S. and warned people to "keep yourself distant" from theaters where the film is playing.

**印度成功发射新式火箭**

印度成功地发射了本国研制的最大火箭和一个无人太空舱，这个太空舱能将宇航员送入太空。

星期四清晨，地球同步卫星运载火箭MK 3号在印度南部安得拉邦的斯里哈里科塔升空。

这种新火箭将能把更重的卫星送入太空。

近年来，印度已经成功地发射过较轻的卫星，但在发射更大负荷的卫星上遇到困难。

今年9月，印度的火星轨道探测器进入火星轨道，使印度成为第一个一次成功将航空器送入火星轨道的亚洲国家。

这项使命由于仅用了7400万美元的小本预算而受到赞扬。

India Launches its Largest Rocket into Space

India has successfully launched its largest rocket and an unmanned capsule which could send astronauts into space.

The Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle MK III blasted off from Sriharikota in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh early Thursday.

The new rocket will be able to carry heavier satellites into space.

India has successfully launched lighter satellites in recent years, but has faced problems sending up heavier payloads.

In September, India's Mars Orbiter Mission entered the red planet's orbit, making India the first Asian nation to reach Mars on its first attempt.

The mission was lauded for its shoestring budget of about $74 million.
