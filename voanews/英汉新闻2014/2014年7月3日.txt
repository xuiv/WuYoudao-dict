**习近平抵达首尔和朴槿惠举行会谈**

中国国家主席习近平开始对韩国进行为期两天的国事访问，很多人将此次访问视为对北京传统盟友朝鲜的冷落。

预计习近平与韩国总统朴槿惠的会谈重点将是朝鲜的核项目和弹道导弹项目。

在过去一周里，朝鲜数次向其东部沿海发射短程导弹。一些人士认为，平壤以这种方式表达对习近平访韩的不满。

这是中国国家主席首次在访问朝鲜之前访问韩国。这是朴槿惠和习近平各自就任以来的第五次会面。
习近平还没有与朝鲜领导人金正恩会面。金正恩于2011年掌权。

预计，习近平此次访问的另一重点是促进首尔与北京的经济关系。中韩两国是重要的贸易伙伴，双方自2012年以来一直就签订自由贸易问题进行谈判。

China's Xi Arrives in Seoul for Talks with Park

Chinese President Xi Jinping has begun a two-day state visit to South Korea, a trip seen by many as a snub to Beijing's historical ally, North Korea.

Mr. Xi's talks with South Korean President Park Geun-hye are expected to be dominated by concerns over North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.

In the past week, the North has fired several short-range rockets off its east coast, in what some view as a sign Pyongyang is unhappy with Mr. Xi's visit.

His trip marks the first time a Chinese president has visited South Korea before North Korea. It is the fifth time Ms. Park and Mr. Xi have met since they took office.

Mr. Xi has not yet met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who took power in 2011.

The visit is also expected to focus on boosting economic ties between Seoul and Beijing, important trading partners that have been negotiating a free trade deal since 2012.

**日本将部分取消对朝鲜的制裁**

日本同意部分取消对朝鲜的制裁措施，目前日本和朝鲜继续就被平壤绑架的日本公民问题进行会谈。
日本首相安倍晋三星期四说，这一举措代表着“全面解决”绑架日本公民问题的开端。安倍晋三没有说明取消制裁的具体项目和时间。

东京和平壤本星期在朝鲜驻北京使馆举行会谈，讨论被绑架的日本公民问题。长期以来，这一问题是妨碍日朝关系的主要因素。日本和朝鲜没有正式邦交。

朝鲜2002年承认曾绑架13名日本公民，让他们为朝鲜间谍教授日本文化。五名被绑架的日本公民已经返回日本。朝鲜说，其他人已经死亡，但很多日本人怀疑至少还有12名日本公民被绑架。

Japan to Lift Some Sanction on North

Japan has agreed to lift some sanctions against North Korea, as the two countries continue talks on Japanese citizens kidnapped by Pyongyang.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday said the move represents the start of a "comprehensive resolution" to the abduction issue. He provided no details on what sanctions would be lifted or when.

Tokyo and Pyongyang this week held talks at North Korea's embassy in Beijing to address the abductions, which have long been a major irritant to bilateral relations. The two countries do not have formal ties.

North Korea acknowledged in 2002 that it abducted 13 Japanese citizens to teach its spies about Japanese culture. Five of the abductees were returned. The North said the rest are dead, but many in Japan suspect at least a dozen more were kidnapped.
