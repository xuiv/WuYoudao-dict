**加沙暴力冲突继续 克里访中东斡旋停火**

在美国等国家努力促进巴以停火之际，以色列军队的战机和坦克继续轰炸加沙地带。哈马斯则继续向以色列发射火箭弹。

巴勒斯坦卫生官员说，以色列的攻击星期四早晨造成至少20人死亡。他们说，以色列7月8日发动攻势以制止哈马斯发射火箭弹以来，已有718名巴勒斯坦人死亡。以色列方面有32名军人丧生。

以色列军方报告说，哈马斯星期四又向以色列发射多枚火箭弹，其中有几枚被铁穹导弹防御系统拦截。

与此同时，美国国务卿克里星期四在开罗继续推动停火。

克里星期三分别会晤了以色列总理内塔尼亚胡、巴勒斯坦民族权力机构主席阿巴斯和联合国秘书长潘基文。克里会谈后没有发表评论，但他在星期三早些时候说，取得一些进展。

Gaza Violence Goes On as Officials Search for Cease-Fire

Israel's military continues to hit the Gaza Strip with airstrikes and tank fire, while Hamas rockets fly into Israel amid efforts to secure a ceasefire to end the fighting.

Palestinian health officials said the Israeli attacks killed at least 20 people early Thursday. They put the total death toll at 718 people since Israel began its campaign to halt Hamas rocket fire on July 8. Thirty-two Israeli soldiers have died.

The Israeli military reported multiple rockets being fired Thursday, including several it said were intercepted by its Iron Dome missile defense system.

Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is in Cairo as he continues to push for a cease-fire solution.

On Wednesday, he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and United Nations chief Ban Ki-moon. He made no comments after those talks, but said earlier in the day that "some progress" had been made.

**澳大利派人保护乌克兰东部坠机现场**

澳大利亚派遣了50名警察前往伦敦，准备将他们部署到乌克兰东部地区，保护马航坠毁现场。他们是前往该地点的国际工作人员的一部分。

澳大利亚总理阿博特说，澳大利亚和荷兰的外长将前往基辅，与乌克兰敲定人员部署的细节。联合国授权保护反政府武装控制地区内的坠机现场。

与此同时，星期四又有两架飞机从乌克兰起飞，将上周马航客机遇难者的几十名遗体运往荷兰。

星期三第一批遗体抵达荷兰时，荷兰成千上万人为死者举行了悼念仪式。被击落的马航班机上共有298人，其中193人是荷兰人。

另外，俄罗斯星期四早些时候要求美国提供证据，证明马航班机是被俄罗斯支持的乌克兰东部分离分子发射的俄制SA-11地对空导弹击落的。俄罗斯国防部副部长安托诺夫要求美国拿出技术证据和卫星图像来。
美国情报分析人士认为，马航班机是被俄罗斯制造的SA-11地对空导弹击落的。 他们认为缺乏训练的乌克兰反政府武装很可能把马航班机误认为是乌克兰飞机。
Australia Seeks to Secure Jet Crash Site in Ukraine

Australia has sent 50 police officers to London in anticipation of deploying them to eastern Ukraine to secure the Malaysian plane crash site as part of a proposed international team.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott said foreign ministers from Australia and The Netherlands will go to Kyiv to iron out the details of deploying such a team, under U.N. authority, to secure the crash site in rebel-held east Ukraine.

Meanwhile, two more planes were due to take off from Ukraine for the Netherlands, carrying dozens more victims of the shoot down of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 last week.

Tens of thousands of mourners in the Netherlands held memorial services and ceremonies, as the first bodies from Flight MH17 arrived in the country on Wednesday. One hundred ninety-three of the victims were Dutch.

Earlier Thursday, Russia called on the United States to prove that the passenger jet was shot down by an SA-11 surface-to-air missile fired by Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. Deputy Defense Minister Anatoly Antonov asked the U.S. to produce proof that it has technical data and satellite photos to back the accusation.

U.S. intelligence analysts have concluded that a Russian SA-11 "Buk" missile downed the aircraft and that ill-trained rebels likely fired the missile believing the aircraft was Ukrainian.
