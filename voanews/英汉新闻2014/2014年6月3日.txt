**天安门事件周年前夕中国镇压异议人士**

在天安门广场镇压事件25周年前夕，中国当局拘留了更多异议人士并警告记者不要报道敏感问题。

在六月三日和四日，北京当局暴力镇压争取民主运动的25周年即将来临之际，数十名活动人士遭到拘留或软禁。

最近被拘留的是中国出生的澳大利亚艺术家郭建。星期日晚上，警察把郭建带走。《金融时报》此前刚刚发表了采访郭建的报道。

中国当局不准公开讨论1989年天安门广场事件，数百名、甚至可能数千名抗议者在这一事件中被中国军人杀害。

星期二，北京戒备森严，警察加紧巡逻，全城布满安全检查哨位。

在敏感的六四周年前夕拘捕活动人士，已经成为北京当局的惯常做法，但国际特赦组织说，目前的拘捕行动比近几年更严厉。

China Cracks Down on Critics Ahead of Tiananmen Anniversary

China is detaining more government critics and warning journalists from reporting on "sensitive topics" ahead of the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown.

Dozens of activists have been detained or placed under house arrest in the lead-up to the June 3-4 anniversary of Beijing's violent suppression of pro-democracy protests.

The latest to be held is Chinese-born Australian artist Guo Jian, who was taken away by police Sunday night, just after the Financial Times published an interview with him.

China does not allow public discussion of the 1989 Tiananmen Square incident, in which hundreds, possibly even thousands, of protesters were killed by Chinese soldiers.

Security was tighter than usual in Beijing on Tuesday, with expanded police patrols and security checkpoints throughout the city.

It has become an annual tradition for Beijing to round up activists ahead of the sensitive anniversary, but Amnesty International says the current wave of detentions is harsher than in recent years.

Mr. Obama and Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski are meeting Tuesday in Warsaw after visiting with airmen from both nations who are part of a mission providing extra air support to the region following Russia's annexation of Crimea.

Their talks are also expected to focus on NATO and U.S.-Polish relations.

The two presidents will host a broader meeting later Tuesday with leaders from Central and European countries. Mr. Obama is also scheduled to meet with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk.

The U.S. leader's trip comes as Ukraine's government battles pro-Russian separatists. He is due to meet with Ukrainian president-elect Petro Poroshenko before leaving Poland on Wednesday.
