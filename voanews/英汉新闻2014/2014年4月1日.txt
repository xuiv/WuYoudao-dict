**北约外长讨论更强硬应对克里米亚危机方案**

北约成员国外长星期二在布鲁塞尔举行会议，商讨如何对俄罗斯并吞乌克兰克里米亚地区做出更强硬的反应。

自乌克兰的这场危机于上月爆发以来，这是北约首次举行高层会议。

到目前为止，北约加强了在巴尔干地区的空中巡逻，同时美国计划与波兰举行力度更大的军演。

外交官们说，北约外长们可能决定扩大北约军演规模，也可能决定在更靠近俄罗斯边界的东欧地区设立永久性基地。

俄罗斯星期一将数百军人撤离乌克兰边界附近地区，但该地区仍驻有数万俄罗斯军队。

美国国务卿克里曾对俄罗斯外长拉夫罗夫表示，俄罗斯军队在乌克兰造成“恐怖气氛”。

NATO to Discuss Stronger Response to Crimean Crisis

NATO foreign ministers meet in Brussels Tuesday to talk about a stronger response to Russia's takeover of Ukraine's Crimea region.

This is the first senior-level NATO gathering since the crisis in Ukraine began last month.

So far, NATO has increased air patrols over the Baltics and the United States is planning more intense military exercises with Poland.

Diplomats say the ministers could decide to step up NATO military exercises or possibly set up permanent bases in Eastern Europe, closer to the Russian border.

Russia pulled back hundreds of troops from its border with Ukraine, Monday, but tens of thousands still remain.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has told Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov that the Russian forces are creating a "climate of fear" inside Ukraine.

**澳官员：失踪客机搜寻行动可能会旷日持久**

一名澳大利亚官员说，搜寻马航失踪客机的行动“可能会旷日持久”，目前有关人员正在继续努力寻找有关这架客机的线索。这架客机失踪已经超过三星期。

新成立的联合搜寻协调中心负责人、前澳大利亚国防部长安格斯·休斯顿说，10架军用飞机星期二在印度洋海域执行搜寻任务，搜寻面积相当于爱尔兰。休斯顿表示，失踪客机的最后确知位置距离这架客机可能坠毁地点看来很远，因此搜寻难度很大。

休斯顿说，这是他所知道的最棘手的搜寻行动，到目前为止，尚未发现任何与失踪客机有关的东西。这架载有239人的客机于3月8日失踪。

星期三，马来西亚总理纳吉布将前往澳大利亚。

Official Says Search for Malaysian Plane 'Could Drag On'

An Australian official has warned that the search for a missing Malaysia Airlines plane "could drag on for a long time" as crews continue to try to find any trace of the aircraft more than three weeks after it vanished.

Former defense chief Angus Houston, who is leading a new joint coordination agency, said 10 military aircraft are working Tuesday searching an area in the Indian Ocean described as the size of Ireland. He said the task has been difficult because the last known location of the plane is far from where it appears to have gone.

He said the search was the most challenging he has seen, and that so far search crews have not found anything connected to the plane that went missing March 8 with 239 people on board.

Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak is due to travel to Australia on Wednesday.
