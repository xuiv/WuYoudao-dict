**奥巴马：美国依然致力于亚洲的发展**

美国总统奥巴马在亚太经合组织首席执行官峰会上发表讲话，他对工商界领袖说，美国完全致力于亚洲的发展。

奥巴马总统星期一上午抵达中国首都北京，参加随后三天举行的APEC峰会。

美国官员认为，在贸易、网络空间以及气候问题上取得进展的同时，这次会议也是制定规则以防止地区的一个途径。

奥巴马星期一在对工商领导人发表的讲话中，宣布了本星期将生效的一项针对中国的新签证政策。

他说：“我非常高兴地宣布，在我访华期间，美中同意落实一项将惠及所有人的新签证安排，其中包括学生、游客以及大小企业。依据目前安排，两国间签证有效期仅为一年。而根据新的安排，学生、交换生签证有效期将延长至五年，商务和旅游签证将延长到10年。”

奥巴马还努力推动华盛顿建立12国“跨太平洋合作伙伴协议”计划。这项计划因不包括中国，并与北京亚洲自贸区的计划相互竞争而具有争议。

但奥巴马同时强调了美中两国经济合作的重要性。

他说：“中美合作，全世界受益，这是在座各位确实感兴趣的东西。(掌声) 我们必须继续努力，加强两国间的双边贸易和投资。”

预计奥巴马总统将同中国国家主席习近平以及其他亚太地区领导人共进晚餐，然后一起观看焰火。

美国关注持续的贸易赤字、网络问题，以及中国对东海和南中国海的主权要求。奥巴马总统希望消除中国领导人中的一种印象，即美国试图通过美军在太平洋的再平衡遏制中国。

奥巴马星期三将动身前往缅甸访问，在缅甸将出席两个东亚峰会，之后前往澳大利亚参加20国集团会议。

President Obama Tells Summit US Still Committed to Asia

U.S. President Barack Obama has addressed the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation CEO summit, telling business leaders that the United States is entirely committed to Asia.

President Obama arrived in the Chinese capital Monday morning. He is attending the APEC summit over the next three days.

U.S. officials see the meeting as a way to set rules that will prevent conflicts in the region, while making progress on trade, cyberspace and climate issues.

In his speech to the business leaders, Mr. Obama announced a new visa policy with China Monday that will take effect this week:

Barack Obama said: "I'm very pleased to announce that during my visit the United States and China have agreed to implement a new arrangement for visas that will benefit everyone from students, to tourists, to businesses large and small. Under the current arrangement, visas between our two countries last for only one year. Under the new arrangement, student and exchange visas will be extended to five years, business and tourist visas will be extended to ten years."

The American president also promoted Washington's plans for a 12-nation "Trans-Pacific Partnership." The plan is controversial because it excludes China and competes with Beijing's plans for an Asia free trade zone.

But, at the same time, Mr. Obama stressed the importance of economic cooperation between the two nations. Barack Obama said: "If China and the United States can work together, the world benefits and that's something this audience is acutely interested in. (Applause). We continually have to work to strengthen the bilateral trade and investment between our two nations."

The president is expected to have dinner with Chinese President Xi Jinping and other Asia-Pacific leaders and then attend a fireworks show.

The United States is concerned about the continuing trade deficit, cyber issues and Chinese maritime claims in the East and South China seas. President Obama wants to dispel the impression among Chinese leaders that the U.S., through the rebalance of its forces to the Pacific, is trying to contain China.

Mr. Obama will depart Beijing on Wednesday for his second visit to Myanmar, also known as Burma. There, he will attend two East Asian summits before going to Australia for a gathering of the G20.


**埃及激进组织宣布效忠伊斯兰国组织**

埃及最致命的激进组织宣布支持伊斯兰国组织领导人。

埃及圣战组织头目安萨尔.贝特.马克迪斯星期一宣布效忠伊斯兰国领导人阿布•贝克尔•巴格达迪。

圣战组织在其推特上发布这一消息，他们称巴格达迪为“哈里发”，并敦促其他穆斯林支持巴格达迪。

伊拉克高级官员星期天报告说，伊斯兰国领导人巴格达迪在空袭中受伤，但是美国国防部说，他们没有这样的信息。

据称伊拉克国防部长奥巴迪在脸书上发信息证实巴格达迪在美军上星期五对北部城市摩苏尔的空袭中受伤。

伊拉克内政部也向美联社证实了巴格达迪受伤的消息。 还有报道说，空袭炸死了巴格达迪一名贴身助手。

英国军方高级将领则警告说，即使报道属实，伊斯兰国还会推出新的指挥官。英国国防参谋长尼克•霍顿星期天表示，即使巴格达迪被打死，他也不会贸然下结论说，这是反叛组织遭遇的一个战略挫折。

Egyptian Militants Pledge Allegiance to IS

The Islamic State leader has won the allegiance of Egypt's deadliest militant group.

Ansar Beit al-Maqdis pledged its loyalty Monday to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

The Egyptian jihadist group announced their support on its Twitter account where it referred to Baghdadi as "caliph" and urged other Muslims to support him.

Senior Iraqi officials reported Sunday that Baghdadi had been wounded in an airstrike, but the U.S. Defense Department says it has no such information.

Iraqi Defense Minister Khalid al-Ubaydi purportedly issued a message on his Facebook page confirming that Baghdadi was wounded in a U.S. airstrike Friday in the northern city of Mosul.

The Iraqi Interior Ministry also confirmed the news to the Associated Press. Various other reports claim the airstrike killed one of Baghdadi's close aides.

Earlier Sunday, Britain's senior military officer warned that even if the reports are true, the Islamic State will regenerate its command. British Chief of Defense Staff Nick Houghton said that even if Baghdadi were killed, he would not rush to the conclusion that it would be a "strategic reverse" for the insurgents.
