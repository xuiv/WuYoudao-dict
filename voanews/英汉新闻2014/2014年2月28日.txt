**乌克兰：俄罗斯军队“封锁”克里米亚机场**


乌克兰内务部长阿瓦科夫指责俄罗斯军队对克里米亚地区的两个机场进行“军事入侵和占领”。

阿瓦科夫星期五在其脸书网页上写道，武装人员封锁了塞瓦斯托波尔的贝尔贝克机场。俄罗斯在塞瓦斯托波尔有一个海军基地。身份不明的人员还在克里米亚首府辛菲罗波尔的国际机场巡逻。

俄罗斯没有对这些指称发表评论。一天前，武装分子占领了克里米亚的政府办公地点。克里米亚是乌克兰的一个地区，该地区与莫斯科关系紧密。武装分子还升起俄罗斯国旗。

与此同时，预计被免职的乌克兰总统亚努科维奇星期五将在俄罗斯南部城市顿河畔的罗斯托夫举行的一次记者会上向媒体发表讲话。亚努科维奇表示，他目前受到俄罗斯的保护。

星期四晚间，美国副总统拜登给乌克兰总理亚采纽克打了电话，对乌克兰组建新政府表示欢迎，并保证美国支持乌克兰实行旨在恢复经济的改革。

乌克兰议会星期四批准得人心的亲西方的反对派领袖亚采纽克出任新的临时政府领导人。

Ukraine: Russian Forces "Blocking" Crimea Airport


Ukraine's interior minister has accused Russian forces of staging a "military invasion and occupation" at two airports in Ukraine's Crimea region.

Interior Minister Arsen Avakov wrote on his Facebook page Friday that the armed men were blocking the Belbek airport in Sevastopol, where Russia has a naval base. Unidentified men were also patrolling the international airport in Simferopol, the Crimean capital.

Russia has not commented on the allegations, which come a day after gunmen had seized control of government buildings in Crimea, a Ukrainian region with strong ties to Moscow. The gunmen also raised the Russian flag.

Meanwhile ousted Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovich, who says he is under Russian protection, is expected to address the media on Friday in a news conference in the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don.

Late Thursday, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden telephoned Ukraine's Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk to welcome the formation of a new government and pledge U.S. support as Ukraine undertakes reforms aimed at restoring the country's economic health. Ukraine's parliament approved Mr. Yatsenyuk, a popular, pro-Western opposition leader, as the head of the interim government earlier in the day.

**俄反对派领袖遭软禁**

俄罗斯一个法庭决定将反对派领导人阿列克谢.纳瓦尔尼软禁至少两个月。

调查人员星期三请求法庭将纳瓦尔尼软禁，说他在受到刑事调查期间违反了旅行限制。

纳瓦尔尼已经被判服刑七天，星期一在莫斯科举行的一次未经允许的抗议集会中，他和数以百计的示威者一道被拘押。

去年，俄罗斯一个上诉法院取消了对他5年监禁的判决。纳瓦尔尼这位反腐博客作者去年7月被认定在2009年组织了盗窃一家木材公司大约50万美元的行动。纳瓦尔尼认为那次判决是出于政治动机。

对纳瓦尔尼和他兄弟奥列格最新的指控包括欺诈和洗钱, 其金额远远超过百万美元。

Russian Opposition Leader Placed Under House Arrest

A Russian court has placed opposition leader Alexei Navalny under house arrest for at least two months.

Investigators on Wednesday asked the court to put Navalny under house arrest, arguing he has violated travel restrictions during a criminal investigation against him.

Navalny was already serving a seven-day sentence after being detained Monday with hundreds of other demonstrators at an unauthorized protest rally in Moscow.

Last year, a Russian appeals court suspended his five-year prison sentence after the anti-corruption blogger was convicted in July of organizing the 2009 theft of some $500,000 from a timber firm. Navalny described the trial as politically motivated.

The latest charges against him and his brother, Oleg, include fraud and money laundering of well over $1 million.
