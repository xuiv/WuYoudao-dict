**乌克兰警告俄罗斯舰队不要发动军事入侵**

乌克兰临时总统图尔奇诺夫警告克里米亚的俄罗斯军舰不要驶离所在地点，此前武装分子占领了克里米亚首都的政府所在地。

图尔奇诺夫星期四说，俄罗斯军队的任何调动都将为视为“军事入侵”。俄罗斯黑海舰队的驻地是克里米亚城市塞瓦斯托波尔。

乌克兰代理内务部长阿瓦科夫星期四早些时候说，亲俄罗斯的克里米亚地区的政府和立法部门被武装人员占领后，警察部队进入高度戒备状态。

来自克里米亚首府的报道说，政府大厦升起俄罗斯国旗。阿瓦科夫说，警察封锁了被占领的政府机构。

在克里米亚，乌克兰新政府的支持者和亲俄罗斯的活动人士之间爆发冲突。克里米亚的大多数居民说俄语，他们支持莫斯科，但当地占人口少数的鞑靼族穆斯林一般持反俄罗斯立场。

星期三，乌克兰临时领导人提名反对派领袖亚采纽克担任新总理。预计乌克兰议会将在星期四晚些时候审议这一提名。

Ukraine Warns Russian Fleet Against "Military Aggression"

Ukraine's acting president has warned the Russian navy in Crimea not to leave its post, after gunmen seized government buildings in the regional capital.

Oleksandr Turchnyov said Thursday that any movement of Russian troops will be considered "military aggression." Russia's Black Sea fleet is based in the Crimean city of Sevastpol.

Earlier Thursday, Ukraine's acting interior minister Arsen Avakov said police are on high alert after the local government and legislature buildings were seized in the capital, Simferopol, by armed men in the pro-Russia region.

Reports say the the Russian flag was raised over the buildings, and Avakov said the occupied buildings have been sealed off by police.

The area has been the scene of confrontations between supporters of Ukraine's new government and pro-Russia activists. The region is mainly made up of Russian speakers who support Moscow but is also home to minority Muslim Tatars who are generally anti-Russia.

On Wednesday, Ukrainian interim leaders named popular opposition figure Arseniy Yatsenyuk as the country's new prime minister. Parliament is expected to consider his name later Thursday.

**韩国基督教传教士金庭旭“承认”在朝鲜从事间谍活动**

韩国基督教传教士金庭旭星期四承认依照首尔的指示，企图推翻朝鲜政府。

金庭旭是遭到朝鲜当局拘押的至少第三名基督教福音传教士，朝鲜当局把未经授权的宗教工作者视为间谍。

金庭旭是在平壤举行的一次记者会上做出上述表示的。他说，去年10月被逮捕时，他身上带有圣经和其他宗教材料。

韩国没有对这一事件发表评论。但针对金庭旭的指控存在疑问，因为朝鲜当局经常要求被拘押的外国人宣读供词来增加自己获释的机会。

平壤去年11月说，逮捕了一名韩国间谍。首尔对此予以否认。后来，才知道被拘押的是50岁的浸礼会传教士金庭旭。

South Korean Missionary 'Confesses' to Spying in Pyongyang

A South Korean Christian missionary confessed Thursday to trying to overthrow the North Korean government at the behest of Seoul.

Kim Jung Wook is at least the third Christian evangelist being detained by North Korea, which views unauthorized religious workers as spies.

His comments came during a news conference in Pyongyang, where he said he was arrested in October with Bibles and other religious material.

South Korea has not commented on the case. But Kim's accusations were in question, as North Korea often requires foreign detainees to read confessions to improve their chances of being freed.

Pyongyang said in November it had arrested what it called a South Korean spy. Seoul then denied the charges. Only later did it become clear the detainee was the 50-year-old Baptist missionary.
