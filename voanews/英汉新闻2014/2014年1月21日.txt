**活动人士呼吁中国释放维族学者**

中国活动人士发起一个请愿运动，呼吁当局立即释放被拘禁的学者伊力哈木·土赫提。伊力哈木是一位著名活动人士，他批评北京压制中国西部地区维族居民的政策。

伊力哈木是维族人，警察上星期三突袭他的家，并把他带走。有关当局至今没有公布伊力哈木的罪名，但中国外交部声称他涉嫌从事犯罪活动。

请愿书登在藏族活动人士唯色的网页上，呼吁当局要么释放伊力哈木，要么提出伊力哈木有不当行为的证据。1千1百多人签署了这份请愿书，其中包括很多中国人。

与此同时，中国国家媒体发表了几篇抨击伊力哈木的社论。上星期六，中共喉舌环球时报指责伊力哈木支持新疆独立运动以及企图为恐怖分子寻找道德依据。

现年45岁的伊力哈木是北京中央民族大学的经济学讲师，他由于发表自己的观点而屡次被拘留和骚扰。

伊力哈木去年11月对美国之音说，由于他在媒体上发表的言论，便衣警察冲撞他的汽车，拿走他的电话，并威胁要杀死他。

Activists Call for China to Free Uighur Academic

Chinese activists have started a petition calling for the immediate release of detained scholar Ilham Tohti, a prominent critic of Beijing's harsh treatment of Uighurs in western China.

Tohti, himself a Uighur, was taken by police during a raid on his home Wednesday. Authorities have not announced any charges against him, though China's foreign ministry says he is "under suspicion of committing crimes."

A petition posted on the website of Woeser, a Tibetan activist, called for China to either free Tohti or provide proof of wrongdoing. As of Tuesday, over 1,100 people had signed the petition, including many in China.

Meanwhile, Chinese state media have published several editorials slamming Tohti. The Communist Party's Global Times on Saturday accused him of advocating separatism in China's Xinjiang province and "attempting to find a moral excuse for terrorists."

The 45-year-old Tohti, an economics professor at the Central University for Nationalities in Beijing, has been detained or harassed several times in the past because of his views.

Tohti told VOA in November plain-clothes police rammed his car, took his phone, and threatened to kill him because of his comments to the media.

**俄罗斯研究威胁冬奥会的激进组织视频**

俄罗斯安全人员正在研究一个伊斯兰激进组织发表的录像。该组织宣称为上月伏尔加格勒的自杀爆炸负责，并威胁要袭击即将在索契举行的冬奥会。

星期日，在达吉斯坦人口以穆斯林为主地区的一个激进组织在网上发表了这段录像。不清楚这段录像的制作时间。

在录像中，两名讲俄语的男子警告普京总统，要他准备在索契冬奥会上接受一份他们所谓的“礼物”。这段录像说，这两人是自杀炸弹爆破手，他们上月在伏尔加格勒发动袭击，炸死34人。这种说法没有得到独立消息来源的证实。
美国军方星期一说，将随时为正在准备索契冬奥会安全事务的俄罗斯政府提供海空支持。五角大楼发言人发表声明说，美国的支持包括黑海海域的两艘美国海军军舰，如果俄罗斯提出要求，美国方面愿以任何方式进行磋商。

另外，在索契的酒店工作人员告诉记者，他们看到通缉一名达吉斯坦妇女的告示。告示称那名妇女是22岁的寡妇，她的丈夫是激进分子，去年被俄罗斯安全部队击毙。告示还说，这名妇女可能在索契或周边地区，可能正在策划一次袭击。

Russians Study Militant Video Threatening Olympics

Russian security forces are studying a video posted by an Islamic militant group that claims responsibility for last month's suicide bombings in Volgograd, and threatens attacks at the upcoming Olympics in Sochi.

The video was posted online Sunday by a militant group from the predominately Muslim region of Dagestan. It is unclear when the video was made.

In the video, two Russian-speaking men warn President Vladimir Putin to expect what they call a "present" at the Sochi Winter Olympics. The video says the two men are the suicide bombers who attacked Volgograd last month, killing 34 people. There is no independent confirmation of that claim.

The U.S. military said Monday it will make available air and naval support to the Russian government as it makes security preparations for the Olympics. A Pentagon spokesman said in a statement that support including two U.S. Navy ships in the Black Sea will be available, if requested, "for all manner of contingencies" in consultation with the Russian government.

In another development, hotel workers in Sochi tell reporters they have seen wanted posters for a woman from Dagestan. She is described as a 22-year-old widow of a militant killed by Russian security forces last year. The posters say the woman ((identified as Ruzanna Ibragimova)) may be in or near Sochi and could be planning an attack.
