**克里：使用桶式炸弹是阿萨德的“最新野蛮行动”**

美国国务卿克里谴责叙利亚政府对北部城市阿勒颇投掷油桶炸弹。

活动人士说，这些袭击事件过去一周在阿勒颇市杀害了数十人。这个城市见证了叙利亚军队与反对阿萨德总统的反政府武装之间一些最惨烈的战斗。

克里周二在一份声明中说，这些轰炸行动是阿萨德政府“最新的野蛮行径”，并表示叙利亚政府正专注于对国家造成更多的破坏。

他说，反对派和国际社会正在努力寻求结束战争，而政府的行为“破坏了”日内瓦和谈成功的希望。

第一轮谈判上周结束，几乎没有取得进展。不过，联合国秘书长潘基文和调停人卜拉希米期待政府和反对派代表2月10日恢复会谈。

Kerry: Barrel Bombs Assad's 'Latest Barbaric Act'

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has criticized the Syrian government for dropping barrel bombs on the northern city of Aleppo.

Activists say those attacks have killed dozens of people in the past week in the city that has seen some of the worst fighting between Syrian forces and rebels opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.

In a statement Tuesday, Kerry said the bombings are the Assad administration's "latest barbaric act," and that the government is focused on inflicting more destruction on the country.

He said the opposition and the international community are trying to find an end to the fighting, while the government's actions "undermined hope" for successful peace talks in Geneva.

The first round of negotiations ended last week with little progress, but Mr. Ban and mediator Lakhdar Brahimi expect delegates from the government and opposition to resume meeting February 10.

**报告：健保法或拉低就业率**

美国国会预算办公室的一份报告预测，新的健保改革法将使劳动力减少200多万个全职岗位。

星期二公布的这份报告可能加剧被称为“奥巴马健保”的医疗保健改革法是否有利于经济的争论。国会预算办公室的报告说，如果人们的医疗保健计划不跟其就业状况挂钩，选择去工作的人就会更少，一些持续工作的人可能会选择缩短工作时间。到2024年，预计将减少的时间合计约250万个全职职位。

包括许多共和党人在内的奥巴马健保批评者们说，这些研究结果表明，这个健保计划最终将对经济造成不利影响。白宫为奥巴马健保辩护说，这份报告没有提出证据证明兼职就业人数增加是医疗保健法案去年年底实施的结果。

报告说，医疗改革的长期影响目前仍不清楚。报告说，随着时间的推移，越来越多的人预计将利用新健保的保险选项。因此，预计加入健保计划者预计将在2015年和2016年大幅增加。

Report: Employment May Shrink Because of Health Care Law

A report by the U.S. Congressional Budget Office predicts the new health care reform law will shrink the work force by more than 2 million full-time positions.

The report, released Tuesday, may fuel the debate over whether the health care reform law known as "Obamacare" is good for the economy. The CBO report said if people's health care plans are not tied to their employment status, fewer will choose to work and some who keep working may choose to work fewer hours. The predicted reduction in hours adds up to about 2.5 million fewer full-time positions by 2024.

Critics of Obamacare, including many Republicans, say the findings show that the plan will ultimately have an adverse effect on the economy. The White House is defending Obamacare, saying the report has not presented evidence that part-time employment has increased as a result of the health care act being implemented late last year.

The report says the long-term effects of the health care reforms are still unclear. It says over time, more people are expected to take advantage of the new coverage options, so enrollment is expected to increase sharply in 2015 and 2016.
