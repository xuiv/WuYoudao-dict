Russia's Putin in India to Boost Energy, Trade Ties

Russian President Vladimir Putin has met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi as part of a one-day visit to discuss expanding energy and defense ties.

Mr. Putin was also due to hold talks Thursday with President Pranab Mukherjee and opposition leader Sonia Gandhi.

Russia is facing stiff Western economic sanctions for its role in the Ukraine crisis, and analysts say the Putin mission is aimed at developing new energy markets to help offset the impact of those sanctions.

Russian and Indian officials said the meetings would likely focus on agreements for military cooperation, space exploration and the construction of new nuclear power plants.

At least 15 trade pacts are set to be signed, as energy-starved India - the world's third largest energy importer -- continues to push for greater involvement in natural gas and oil exploration inside Russia.
