设在伦敦的人权组织叙利亚人权嘹望台说，政府军星期四空袭伊斯兰国武装分子控制地区巴卜和邻近城镇卡巴辛，造成至少37名平民死亡，其中包括7名儿童和2名妇女。此前该组织报告的死亡数字是21人。

空袭地区位于阿勒颇东北方向，一直是政府军轰炸的目标。

美国领导的空袭行动也试图将伊斯兰国武装分子赶出他们在叙利亚东北部和伊拉克北部的大本营。

本周早些时候，伊斯兰国武装分子抓获一名约旦飞行员，他驾驶的战机在叙利亚城镇拉卡附近坠毁。

美国和约旦军方承认飞机坠毁，但反驳了伊斯兰国武装分子有关他们击落了这架飞机的声称。

37 Syrian Civilians Killed in Gov't Airstrikes

A group monitoring the confilct in Syria says goverment airstrikes have killed at least 37 civilians in an area controlled by Islamic State fighters.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says seven children and two women were among those killed in the attack on Al-Bab and the nearby town of Qabaseen.

The British-based group had previously put the death toll from the Thursday airstrikes at 21.

The area, northeast of Aleppo, is controlled by Islamic State extremists and has been the target of repeated government bombings.

A U.S.-led campaign of airstrikes is also attempting to drive the rebels out of their strongholds in northeast Syria and northern Iraq.

Earlier this week, Islamic State militants captured a Jordanian pilot whose coalition fighter jet went down near the Syrian town of Raqqa.

The U.S. and Jordanian militaries have acknowledged the plane crashed, but dispute militant claims that brought it down.


**乌克兰冲突双方和谈计划称泡影**

乌克兰政府官员和亲俄反叛武装代表星期五将不会按原计划在白俄罗斯首都明斯克举行新一轮和平会谈。

白俄罗斯官员星期五宣布双方谈判破裂，但没有透露原因。现在还不清楚会谈是否会在稍晚一些时候恢复。

乌克兰政府和亲俄分离分子的会面没能就结束乌克兰东部8个月的冲突取得任何突破进展。

媒体星期四引述分离主义领导人的话说，这个星期在白俄罗斯会谈的唯一成果是针对交换大约400名战俘的条件达成了一致。

参与和平努力的还有俄罗斯官员以及来自欧洲安全与合作组织的调停人。

Ukraine Peace Talks Break Down

Ukrainian officials and pro-Russian rebels will not be meeting in Belarus' capital Minsk for a round of peace talks scheduled for Friday.

Belarussian officials on Friday announced the breakdown of the negotiations but did not give a reason. It is not clear if the talks will resume at a later date.

Talks between Ukrainian government negotiators and their pro-Russian separatist counterparts have failed to produce any breakthrough to end the eight-month conflict in eastern Ukraine.

Separatist leaders were quoted as saying Thursday that the only tangible result of the talks in Belarus this week was an agreement on the terms of a prisoner exchange of about 400 fighters.

Peace efforts have also involved Russian officials and mediators from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
