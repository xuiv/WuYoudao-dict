Lauren Bacall Dies at 89

Legendary American actress Lauren Bacall, the onetime model who became an overnight film star working opposite another movie legend, Humphrey Bogart, has died at the age of 89.

Her family says Bacall died after a massive stroke at her New York City home Tuesday morning.

Bacall captivated audiences from the moment she burst onto the silver screen in the 1940s, with her distinctively husky voice and sultry looks. She was just 20 years old when she played opposite Bogart in the 1944 film "To Have and Have Not."

"You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? Just put your lips together and...blow."

Bacall and Bogart were married the next year and the two went on to star together in several films, including "The Big Sleep," "Dark Passage," and "Key Largo." She appeared in more than 30 other movies, including "How to Marry a Millionaire," with Marilyn Monroe.

She was married to Bogart until his death in 1957. She later had a well-publicized affair with Frank Sinatra and a turbulent marriage to actor Jason Robards.

In her later years, Bacall won two Best Actress Tony awards for her work on the stage. In 2009, she was awarded an honorary Oscar by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

In 1999, the American Film Institute named Bacall 20th on its list of the top 25 actresses of all time.

Europeans Will No Longer Resupply International Space Station

An unmanned European spacecraft has resupplied the International Space Station for the last time.

The cargo ship named for Georges Lemaitre, who proposed the "Big Bang" theory, docked at ISS on Tuesday.

The craft carried 6.6 tons of fuel, water, oxygen, food, clothes and scientific experiments to the six-member crew aboard ISS. The vessel launched July 30 from Kourou in French Guiana.

The cargo ship will remain docked with ISS for six months. It will then be allowed to burn up in a controlled re-entry over the South Pacific.

ISS will be supplied in the future by the Russians and two NASA-contract firms.
