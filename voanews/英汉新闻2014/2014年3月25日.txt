**俄罗斯：从G8除名只能起反作用**

俄罗斯说， 七国集团经济会议决定取消俄罗斯的八国集团资格只能起到反作用。

美国总统奥巴马和七国集团其他国家的领导人星期一决定在6月份举行自己的七国集团峰会，而不是出席原计划在俄罗斯举行的八国会议。

俄罗斯总统普京的发言人星期二就此发表评论。

美国、英国、法国、德国、意大利、加拿大和日本的领导人在海牙举行的核安全峰会期间召开了会议，讨论俄罗斯吞并克里米亚半岛的问题。

上述国家的领导人在会后发布的联合声明中表示，在莫斯科“改弦易辙”之前，暂停其八国集团成员资格。

俄罗斯媒体援引克里姆林宫发言人的话说，俄罗斯随时准备而且有兴趣继续与八国集团成员进行接触，但是俄罗斯外长拉夫罗夫星期一说，如果俄罗斯被除名，也不是什么“了不起的悲剧”。

Russia: G8 Snub 'Counterproductive'

Russia has dismissed as "counterproductive" a move by world powers to cut Moscow out of the Group of Eight industrialized nations over its actions in Ukraine.

The spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin ((Dmitry Peskov)) made the comment one day after the seven other G8 nations agreed to hold their own Group of Seven summit in June instead of attending the previously-planned G8 meeting in Russia.

In a joint statement issued on the sidelines of a nuclear security summit in The Hague, Netherlands, the leaders of the U.S., Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan said they were suspending their participation with Russia in the G8, until Moscow "changes course." Western powers have been moving to isolate Russia over its annexation of the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine.

Russian news agencies quote the Kremlin spokesman as saying Russia is ready for and interested in continuing contacts with its fellow G8 countries. But Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Monday it would be "no great tragedy" if Russia were dropped from the coalition.

**失踪班机乘客亲属北京街头抗议 搜寻行动因天气恶劣而暂停**

失踪马航班机的乘客家属们星期二愤怒地在马来西亚驻北京使馆前抗议。与此同时恶劣天气迫使搜寻客机的行动暂时停止。

大约100名家属星期二举着标语在马来西亚驻北京使馆前愤怒抗议，要求马来西亚方面告知真相。

马来西亚政府星期一宣布他们断定马航班机在印度洋南部坠毁。

有些抗议家属把马来西亚官员称为骗子和杀人犯。当中国警察不许抗议家属跟被警方挡在附近的记者交谈时，抗议者跟警察发生推搡。

马航航班上239名乘客中有三分之二是中国人。很多家属说，除非拿出证据，否则他们不会相信马来西亚政府的结论。

但要很快找到证据是不太可能的。澳大利亚海事安全署星期二说，由于风急浪高，云层很厚，飞机和船只无法在珀斯以西2千5百公里的海域展开搜寻。如果天气好转，星期三将恢复搜寻工作。

Chinese Families of Missing MH370 Passengers Protest

Angry relatives of the passengers on board the missing Malaysian jetliner protested in front of the Malaysian embassy in Beijing Tuesday, as the search for the plane was suspended due to bad weather.

Around 100 Chinese family members held signs and demanded to know the "truth" about the plane, which Malaysian authorities have now concluded crashed into a remote area of the southern Indian Ocean.

In some cases, the protesters called Malaysian government officials "liars" and "murderers." After police prevented them from reaching nearby journalists who were blocked from the protest, some of the protesters clashed with police.

Two-thirds of the 239 people on board the plane were from China, and many of their family members say they will not believe the Malaysian government's conclusions until officials provide proof.

But proof is not likely to come soon, since Australian authorities were forced Tuesday to delay the search for 24 hours because of high waves, strong winds and dense clouds.
