**俄罗斯在乌克兰边境附近展开军演**

俄罗斯官员说，星期一在中部和西部地区展开军事演习，将包括毗邻乌克兰的地区。

官员们说，将有1百多架战机和直升机参加演习。这次演习将于星期五结束。

尽管在宣布演习消息时没有提及乌克兰，俄罗斯此次军演可能使已经很动荡的该地区的紧张局势进一步加剧。

乌克兰军队和亲俄分离武装之间的激烈战斗星期日继续进行，而调查人员在马航坠机现场的调查工作进入第三天。

顿涅茨克地区的官员说，六人在双方的炮击中丧生。路透社说，另有三人在卢甘斯克被打死。

与此同时，又有多具马航17号航班遇难者的遗骸星期日抵达哈尔基夫，准备运往荷兰参加坠机调查的荷兰警方小组负责人阿尔伯斯伯格说，已经完成对一个区域的搜寻工作。坠机现场被分为五个区域。他说，完成全部搜寻工作至少需要三个星期。


Russia Begins Military Drills Near Ukrainian Border

Russian officials say the military is beginning exercises Monday in the central and western regions of the country, which would include the Ukraine border region.

The officials say the drills involving more than 100 fighter jets and helicopters will last through Friday.

While the announcement did not mention Ukraine, the military exercises could increase tensions in the already volatile region.

On Sunday, deadly clashes between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists continued as investigators searched the site of a plane crash for a third day.

Local officials in Donetsk say six people were killed there in shelling between the two sides. Reuters news agency says three other people were killed in Luhansk.

Meanwhile, the remains of more victims from Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 arrived in Kharkiv Sunday to be prepared for transportation to the Netherlands.

The head of the Dutch police mission working at the crash site says crews have finished searching one of five zones of the crash site. He said completing the search will take at least three weeks.


**以色列宣布在加沙实行七小时停火**

以色列宣布在加沙大部分地区实行7小时停火，以便巴勒斯坦人得到人道救助，并使离家躲避炮火的平民得以回家。自停火开始后，星期一没有关于发生暴力事件的报道。

但在预定开始停火的数小时前，以色列发动空袭，打死一名巴勒斯坦激进组织领导人。伊斯兰圣战者组织说，加沙地带北部地区该组织指挥官曼苏尔的住宅被以色列炮弹击中，曼苏尔被打死。

在实行停火之前，以色列星期一在加沙边境附近部署了坦克。

控制加沙地带的哈马斯表示，对以色列宣布实行停火持怀疑态度，并敦促加沙地带的巴勒斯坦人“保持警惕”。

停火将在格林威治时间7点开始。就在宣布停火的几小时前，以色列对加沙地带南部城镇拉法发动空袭，至少导致10名平民丧生，当时他们正在联合国的一所学校里避难。以色列军方随后表示，当时轰炸的目标是学校附近的三名激进分子嫌疑人，并说目前正在审查这次空袭造成的后果。以色列军方还表示，星期一的停火不包括拉法地区，以色列将继续对那里实施军事行动。

10天来，这是联合国学校第三次成为致命轰炸的目标，国际社会对此加以谴责。联合国秘书长潘基文强烈指责最近这次空袭，称其为“违反道德的暴行和犯罪”。
美国国务院发言人莎琪说，空袭联合国学校是“可耻”和“令人震惊”的。


Israel Declares 7-Hour Gaza Truce

No accounts of violence have been reported Monday since the time Israel said it would begin holding fire for seven hours in most of the Gaza Strip to allow Palestinians access to humanitarian aid and for displaced civilians to return to their homes.

However, just hours before the truce was scheduled to start, an Israeli airstrike killed a militant Palestinian leader. The Islamic Jihad group said its commander in the northern part of the the Gaza Strip, Daniel Mansour, died when the strike hit his home.

Israel positioned tanks near the Gaza border Monday before the cease-fire went into effect.

Hamas, which controls Gaza, says it it skeptical about the truce announcement, and urged Palestinians in Gaza "to take caution."

The truce, beginning at 0700 UTC, was announced just hours after an Israeli airstrike in the southern Gaza town of Rafah killed at least 10 civilians who had sought shelter in a United Nations school.

The Israeli military later said it had targeted three suspected militants near the school, and said it was "reviewing the consequences" of the strike. It also said Monday's truce will not apply to Rafah where military operations were set to continue.

It is the third time in 10 days that a U.N. school has been the target of lethal explosions that have drawn international condemnation. The latest attack also drew a strong rebuke from U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon, who called it "a moral outrage and a criminal act."

U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki called it "disgraceful" and "appalling."
