**西方最新制裁针对俄国国防工业**

美国表示，西方对俄罗斯卷入乌克兰事务的最新制裁针对俄罗斯的国防工业和那些跟普京总统关系密切的公司。

白宫助理、副国家安全顾问布林肯星期天在美国电视新闻节目上说，从本星期开始，最新制裁将向和普京最密切的大公司官员以及他们控制的公司施加额外的压力。

布林肯说，制裁将针对向俄罗斯国防公司的高科技出口。他还预言，“这些措施加在一起将产生影响。”

新的制裁措施是美国和欧洲盟国迫使普京遏制俄罗斯在东乌克兰的作用，从俄乌边界撤出军队的最新尝试。早些时候的制裁针对一些银行活动和其他和普京关系密切的大公司官员。

很难确定这些制裁能否对俄国经济造成直接影响。在俄罗斯跟西方就乌克兰问题发生对峙之前，俄罗斯经济就已经疲弱。今年的增长预计微乎其微。布林肯说，从今年初开始俄国金融市场下跌了22%。卢布处于历史最低点。投资者已经从俄罗斯经济中撤出7百亿美元。

New Western Sanctions to Target Russian Defense Industry

The U.S. says new Western economic sanctions against Russia for its involvement in Ukraine will target Moscow's defense industry and companies with close links to President Vladimir Putin.

A White House aide, deputy national security adviser Tony Blinken, told Sunday news shows in the U.S. that starting this week the latest sanctions would exert "additional pressure" on the corporate officials closest to Mr. Putin and the companies they control.

Blinken said high technology exports to the defense firms would be targeted and predicted that "all of this together is going to have an impact."

The increased sanctions are the latest attempt by the U.S. and its European allies to try to force Mr. Putin to curb Russia's role in eastern Ukraine and pull back its military forces from near the Russian border with Ukraine. Earlier sanctions targeted some banking activities and other corporate officials close to Mr. Putin.

Whether the sanctions are having a direct effect on the Russian economy is hard to determine. The Russian economy had been weakening even before Russia's stalemate with the West over Ukraine evolved, with growth expected this year to be negligible. Blinken said that Moscow's financial markets have dropped 22 percent since the beginning of the year, the ruble is at all-time low and investors have withdrawn $70 billion from the Russian economy.

伊拉克安全部队成员星期一开始参加投票。自美国军队2011年底撤离后，这是伊拉克首次举行选举。

伊拉克安全部队率先投票，其他选民将在两天后投票选举新议会。

投票开始前，伊拉克不断发生暴力事件，逊尼派激进分子袭击安全部队和在伊拉克占多数的什叶派穆斯林。

分析人士说，伊拉斯选民星期三很可能以教派和种族因素来决定投票意向。

Iraq's Security Forces Cast Ballots for Parliament

Members of Iraq's security forces began voting Monday in the country's first election since the withdrawal of U.S. troops in late 2011.

The security forces are voting two days ahead of the rest of Iraq for the new parliament.

The lead-up to the vote has been marred by violence with Sunni militants targeting security forces and members of the nation's Shi'ite majority.

Analysts say voters Wednesday will likely cast ballots along sectarian and ethnic lines.
