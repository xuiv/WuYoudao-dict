**油价下跌令俄罗斯经济雪上加霜**

俄罗斯财政部长西卢阿诺夫说，由于西方制裁和油价下跌，俄罗斯预计会损失1千多亿美元。

西卢阿诺夫星期一在莫斯科的一个经济会议上，西方制裁可能导致俄罗斯每年损失400亿美元。

美国和欧盟因为俄罗斯在乌克兰冲突中的作用而多次对其进行制裁。俄罗斯否认参与东乌克兰的敌对行动。虽有停火协议，但东乌克兰的亲俄武装经常与乌克兰政府军交火。

西卢阿诺夫还说，石油价格已下跌30%，俄罗斯经济每年会因此而可能损失1千亿美元。

俄罗斯通讯社说，由于油价下跌，俄罗斯卢布与美元的兑换率过去三个月降低了大约23%。

Russia to Lose Billions Over Sanctions, Falling Oil Prices

Russia's finance minister says Russia is on a course to lose more than $100 billion due to Western sanctions and falling oil prices.

Anton Siluanov said Monday at an economic forum in Moscow that Russia could lose as much as $40 billion per year because of Western sanctions.

The United States and the European Union have imposed several rounds of sanctions against Russia for its role in the conflict in Ukraine. Russia denies involvement in hostilities in eastern Ukraine where pro-Russian forces are frequently involved in skirmishes against Ukrainian government troops, despite a cease-fire agreement.

Siluanov also said Russia could lose up to $100 billion annually because of oil prices that have fallen by 30 percent.

The Ria Novosti news agency says the Russian ruble has fallen about 23 percent against the U.S. dollar in the past three months as a result of the falling oil prices.


**联盟号飞船与国际空间站完成对接**

运载意大利首位女宇航员的俄罗斯联盟号飞船与国际空间站安全对接。

美国航天局说，联盟号飞船从哈萨克斯坦的一个俄罗斯宇航中心升空后，经过将近6小时飞行，运载意大利宇航员克里斯托弗雷蒂、俄罗斯宇航员施卡普列罗夫和美国宇航员弗茨飞抵国际空间站。他们将在空间站驻留到明年5月。

俄罗斯伊塔尔塔斯社说，宇航员们携带15罐鱼子酱到空间站，用来庆祝新年。

此前国际空间站上已有一名美国宇航员巴瑞•威尔默和两名俄罗斯宇航员，亚历山大•萨莫库佳耶夫和叶琳娜•谢罗娃。

自美国航天飞机2011年退役后，俄罗斯联盟号飞船独自肩负了在地球和国际空间站之间运送宇航员的任务。

Astronauts Dock at International Space Station

A Russian Soyuz spacecraft carrying Italy's first female astronaut has safely docked with the International Space Station.

The U.S. space agency NASA said Samantha Cristoforetti, along with Russians Anton Shkaplerov and American Terry Virts arrived at the space station Monday nearly six hours after taking off from Russia's space facility in Kazakhstan. They will remain on the station until May.

The Russian news agency Itar Tass says the astronauts brought 15 30-gram cans of caviar to the station to use in the New Year's celebration on the station.

The newly arrived astronauts are joining three other astronauts, one American, Barry Wilmore, and two Russians, Alexander Samoukutyaev and Elena Serova, already on the space station.

Since the retirement of the U.S. space shuttle fleet in 2011, Russian Soyuz spacecraft have served as the only means to ferry crew to and from the space outpost.
