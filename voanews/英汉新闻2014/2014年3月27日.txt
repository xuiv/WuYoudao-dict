**班机搜寻再因而天气延迟 新卫星图像显示更多碎片**

泰国卫星照片显示了更多有可能与失踪马航班机有关的碎片，但是搜寻行动再度因为天气恶劣而推迟。

泰国地理空间技术局星期四说，泰国的一枚卫星在印度洋南部偏远海域看到了大约300个漂浮物，最小的有两米，最大的有15米。

在这一消息传出之前，法国卫星照片显示，在附近海域有122件值得关注的物体，其中有些闪闪发光，最长的有23米。

到目前为止，各方试图进入碎片海域的努力还没有获得成功。

澳大利亚海事安全局星期四说，由于条件恶劣，所有搜寻飞机被迫离开那片区域，但船只将继续搜索。

当局在澳大利亚时间星期四晚间通过推特发表声明说，恶劣天气预计将持续24个小时。

各方之前向那里紧急调派了11架飞机和五艘船只，希望赶在恶劣天气来临之前抵达可能有残骸碎片的海域。

这是搜寻行动因为天气状况不好而第二次被推迟。那片海域位于澳大利亚以西2500公里，是地球上最边远、最危险的水域之一。

Bad Weather Delays MH370 Search; New Satellite Images Released

Thai satellite photos have revealed more possible debris from the missing Malaysian jetliner, but the search for the plane was again delayed because of bad weather.

The Thai space agency said Thursday one of its satellites spotted about 300 floating objects ranging from two to 15 meters in size in the remote southern Indian Ocean.

The news comes after 122 possible objects, some of them shiny and up to 23 meters long, were seen in French satellite photos near the same area.

Efforts to reach the debris have so far been unsuccessful.

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority said Thursday poor conditions forced all search planes to leave the region. It said ships will continue searching.

In a statement on Twitter Thursday evening Australia time, the authority said it expects the bad weather to continue for 24 hours.

Eleven airplanes and five ships had scrambled to the area, 2,500 kilometers off the southwest coast of Australia, in an effort to reach the possible debris before the bad weather hit.

It is the second time this week that poor conditions have delayed the search, which is taking place in one of the most isolated and treacherous bodies of water on Earth.

**IMF将向乌克兰提供180亿美元贷款**

国际货币基金组织承诺向乌克兰提供最多达180亿美元的贷款。但是，做为交换，乌克兰必须执行严格的经济改革措施。

国际货币基金组织(IMF)说，将提供140亿到180亿美元的贷款，这些资金将与来自国际社会的捐助合在一起，在今后两年的援助总额将达到270亿美元。

不算国际货币基金组织要求的紧缩措施，按照乌克兰总理亚采纽克星期四在议会的讲话，乌克兰经济有可能在今年收缩10%。他说，国家处在“经济和财政破产”的边缘。

IMF to Loan Ukraine Up to $18 Billion

The International Monetary Fund has pledged to provide Ukraine with up to $18 billion in loans.

But the country must enact tough economic reforms in exchange.

The IMF says the $14 to $18 billion it will provide will combine with contributions from the international community to total up to $27 billion in total assistance in the next two years.

Without the IMF-mandated austerity measures, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk told parliament Thursday Ukraine's economy could contract by 10 percent this year. He said the country is on the brink of "economic and financial bankruptcy."
