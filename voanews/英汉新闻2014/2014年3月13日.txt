**纽约楼房煤气泄漏引起爆炸证实五人死亡**

美国纽约市著名的哈林地区两座楼房星期三发生爆炸，目前已经证实有五人死亡。

爆炸是煤气泄漏造成的，两座楼房被夷为平地，救援人员连夜在瓦砾中寻找九个失踪的人。至少63人在爆炸中受伤。

在曼哈顿大部分地区可以看到从爆炸的建筑物中冒出的浓烟。爆炸造成的碎片散落在整个街区的人行道上，并且覆盖了通勤火车的部分铁轨，纽约大中央车站星期三大部分时间停运。

在爆炸发生前几分钟，附近楼房的居民打电话给煤气供应商联合爱迪生公司报告说，闻到有煤气泄漏的气味。

纽约市长白思豪将这次爆炸称为“最糟糕的悲剧”，因为爆炸发生时没有时间来拯救生命。

Death Toll Rises in New York City Building Explosion

Five people are now confirmed dead in Wednesday's deadly building explosion in New York City's famous Harlem neighborhood.

Rescue crews worked past midnight searching through the rubble to locate nine other people who were still missing after a gas leak caused an explosion that leveled two apartment buildings. At least 63 people were injured.

Thick smoke from the buildings could be seen throughout much of Manhattan. The blast sent debris over several blocks across the neighborhood and a nearby commuter rail line, suspending train service in and out of Grand Central Station for much of the day.

Residents in a nearby building called officials at energy company Consolidated Edison to report the smell of natural gas just minutes before the explosion.

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio called the incident "a tragedy of the worst kind" because it happened with no time to save people.

**搜索飞机在中国卫星图像显示漂浮物海域未发现失联班机残骸**


马来西亚和越南说，中国卫星图像显示了可能是马航失联班机残骸的漂浮物，但在该水域没有发现存在班机残骸的任何迹象。

马来西亚和越南星期四派飞机在南中国海有关水域上空搜索，但没有发现任何东西。

马来西亚民航局局长拉赫曼说，没有发现有关失联班机的任何线索。

中国星期三公布了有关卫星图像，同时中国国家媒体说，卫星图像显示在这架飞机原定的飞往北京的航线附近有三个相当大的漂浮物。

与此同时，华尔街日报星期四报道说，美国调查人员怀疑这架马航班机在飞过位于泰国湾的最后确定位置后，又在空中停留了四小时。

华尔街日报说，做出这一判断的根据是失联班机引擎向地面自动发送的信号，并说这架班机可能又飞了4千公里。

来自12个国家的船只和飞机在马来西亚周边海域进行搜索，搜索范围达9万3千平方公里。如果失联班机又飞了四小时，就大大超出了目前的搜索范围，可能进入了阿拉伯海、印度洋或太平洋上空。

Search Planes Find No Sign of Missing Jet in Area Flagged by Chinese Satellites

Malaysia and Vietnam say there is no sign of a missing Malaysian airliner in the area where Chinese satellite images showed potential debris floating in the water.

The two countries sent search planes over the area in the South China Sea on Thursday, but officials said they did not find anything.

China released the images Wednesday, with state media saying they showed three fairly large objects near the plane's original flight path toward Beijing.

Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that U.S. investigators suspect the Malaysia Airlines plane remained in the air for four hours after passing its last known location over the Gulf of Thailand.

The report said the belief is based on data that is automatically sent by the plane's engines to the ground, and suggests the aircraft could have flown for an additional 4,000 kilometers.

Ships and aircraft from 12 countries are involved in a sprawling search that covers 93,000 square kilometers in the waters on both sides of Malaysia. An extra four hours in the air would put the plane far outside the search area, reaching potentially into areas of the Arabian Sea, Indian Ocean or Pacific Ocean.
