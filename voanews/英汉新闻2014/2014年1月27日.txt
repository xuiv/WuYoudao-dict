China Tries Four Dissidents

Four members of a grassroots movement campaigning to root out corrupt Chinese officials have gone on trial, a day after the group's founder was sentenced to prison.

The four members of the New Citizen's Movement appeared in a Beijing court Monday, charged with "gathering crowds to disrupt order."

A U.S. embassy official in Beijing (Daniel Delk) called on the Chinese government to release the activists immediately, and "remove restrictions" on freedoms "to which they are entitled under China's international human rights commitments."

The group's founder, prominent legal scholar and rights activist Xu Zhiyong, was sentenced to four years in prison Sunday, convicted of the same charge.

Xu, a 40-year-old legal scholar, founded the grassroots New Citizens Movement. The group supports democracy and the rule of law, and has the stated goal of cracking down on corrupt officials.

**乌克兰司法部长威胁将宣布“紧急状态”**

乌克兰司法部长威胁说，如果示威者不离开在基辅的司法部，就要宣布进入紧急状态。示威者们周日夜晚强行占据了司法部。

司法部长奥莱娜·卢卡什(Olena Lukash)周一在电视上露面时还警告说，如果这座建筑不被归还政府，她会要求终止反对派和总统维克托·亚努科维奇（Viktor Yanukovych）之间的会谈。

反对派领导人说亚努科维奇提名祖国党的抗议领袖亚采纽克（Arseniy Yatsenyuk）出任总理，以及提名前拳击冠军和打击党领袖维塔利·克利奇科作他的副手是不足以结束示威的。示威活动正在向东蔓延进入被视为支持总统的地区。

亚采纽克告诉示威民众，反对派是“不怕”接受更多的政治责任。但他说，亚努科维奇仍然需要满足几个要求。这些要求包括提前选举、关进狱中的示威者恢复自由和废除反对抗议的法律。

Ukraine Justice Minister Threatens State of Emergency

Ukraine's justice minister has threatened to declare a state of emergency if protesters do not leave the justice ministry in Kyiv, which they seized late Sunday.

In a television appearance Monday, Justice Minister Olena Lukash also warned that she would ask for talks between the opposition and President Viktor Yanukovych to be ended if the building is not returned to the government.

Opposition leaders have said Mr. Yanukovych's offer to name protest leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk of the Fatherland Party as prime minister, and former boxing champion and leader of the UDAR party, Vitaly Klitschko, his deputy is not enough to end the demonstrations, which are spreading eastward into parts of Ukraine considered supporters of the president.

Yatsenyuk told a crowd that the opposition is "not afraid" of accepting more political responsibility. But he said Mr. Yanukovych still has to meet several demands. They include early elections, freedom for jailed protesters, and repealing anti-protest laws.
