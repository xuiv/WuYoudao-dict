Lavrov Urges Ukraine Cease-Fire as Parties Hold Talks

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov says talks Monday in Belarus should focus on an immediate, unconditional cease-fire in Ukraine.

The meeting in Minsk involves representatives from Russia, Ukraine and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. It was not clear if pro-Russian separatists would also take part.

Lavrov also said there will be no Russian military intervention in neighboring Ukraine.

NATO estimates there are at least 1,000 Russian troops present inside Ukraine, and European Union leaders have demanded that Russia immediately withdraw its forces from the country. Russia has repeatedly denied it has any troops in Ukraine.

The talks in Minsk come a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin called for substantive talks on statehood for southeastern Ukraine. He said on state television that such a move is needed "to protect the lawful interests of people" who live in the region.


**美国周一庆祝劳工节**

美国民众星期一庆祝劳工节。这是一个向工人所做贡献表示敬意的全国性假日。在美国，劳工节也非正式地标志着夏日的结束。

在美国工会的推动下，9月的第1个星期一于1894年正式成为假日。数十年来，美国各地城市在这一天举行大规模游行，向工会工人们表示敬意。

以往30年来，随着科技的发展和世界经济全球化，美国工会会员人数逐步减少。1983年，20%的美国工人是工会会员，到2013年已减少到了11%。

不过，数十年来工会看到了工作成果。大部分美国工作场所的工人都能享受到很多福利，包括每周5天工作制、健康保险以及带薪休假。

US Celebrates Labor Day

Americans are celebrating Labor Day, a national holiday honoring the contributions of workers. The holiday has also come to mark the unofficial end of summer in the United States.

The first Monday in September became an official holiday in 1894 after a push by the nation's labor unions. For decades, cities used the occasion to stage large parades honoring unionized factory workers.

Labor unions have seen their membership fall steadily in the past 30 years with the growth of technology and the globalization of the world economy. In 1983, 20 percent of U.S. workers were in a union compared with 11 percent in 2013.

However, over the years, unions have seen their work result in many desired benefits being enshrined in much of the U.S. workplace, including five-day work weeks as well as health care and vacations paid for by employers.
