** G20 Nations Pledge to Boost Global Economy**
VOA News

Leaders of the G20, representing the world's largest advanced and developing economies, have adopted a plan to boost global economic growth by more than $2 trillion over five years, by investing in infrastructure and increasing free trade.

As the G20 summit ended Sunday in Brisbane, the international leaders also pledged cooperation for strong action against climate change and support for an international response to the Ebola breakout in West Africa.

U.S. President Barack Obama said policies adopted by the G20 could add 100 million jobs for women over the next decade and stiffen regulation of global corporations.

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said nations will hold each other accountable by monitoring implementation of their commitments to boost growth.

Mr. Obama is facing contentious fights with opposition Republican lawmakers in Washington over immigration and construction of an oil pipeline through the central U.S. But he said the past week he spent in the Asian-Pacific region proved to be a "strong week for American leadership."

The G20, which represents 85 percent of the global economy, has been plagued by weak growth in Europe, which could record its third recession in six years, as well as in China and Japan, the world's second and third biggest economies after the U.S.

Pakistan’s military says fresh fighting in a volatile northwestern border region has left at least 34 militants and three soldiers dead.

Fighter planes bombed suspected hideouts Sunday morning in the Dattakhel area of North Waziristan Agency, a semi-autonomous tribal territory near the Afghan border. The army's media wing says at least 27 militants, including "important commanders and foreigners" were killed in the action.

The airstrikes followed overnight clashes in Dattakhel that left three soldiers and seven militants dead. Officials said four personnel were also wounded in the exchange of fire.

On Friday, the army reported airstrikes killing at least 30 fighters in the area adjacent to the Afghan border.

The military launched the Waziristan offensive, called Zarb-e-Azb, in June and says it has so far cleared “90 percent territory” of suspected terrorists. The operation area was later extended to nearby Khyber Agency, another tribal district on the Afghan border, to kill or capture militants fleeing from North Waziristan.
