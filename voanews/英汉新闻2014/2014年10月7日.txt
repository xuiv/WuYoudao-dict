**墨西哥发现乱葬坑**

墨西哥总统表示，对于有警察官员和黑帮团伙涉嫌卷入43名学生抗议者失踪一案，有关人员不可能不受惩罚。

涅托总统星期一举行记者会，向全国发表讲话。此前两天，在墨西哥格雷罗州发现了一处乱葬坑。一名检察长已经把这处葬坑和学生失踪一案联系在一起，调查人员正在等待DNA测试结果。

涅托总统说：“我们必须找到事实的真相，确保将犯下如此罪行的人绳之以法。这些罪行毫无疑问非常残暴，令人痛苦，无法接受。”

涅托总统表示，墨西哥人民和失踪者家人“无时无刻不在要求对事实做出澄清解释，要求正义得到伸张，要求找到那些对事件负责的罪犯，对于他们不会存在宽恕。”

墨西哥一名检察官表示，两名黑帮职业杀手供认，他们帮助当地警方杀害了抗议学生当中的17人。这些抗议学生10天前失踪。

有关官员星期六在伊瓜拉市一处大型葬坑中发现28具尸体。此前一周，警方向运送学生的巴士开火，但是具体起因尚不清楚。在巴士附近发现了1百多个弹壳。

格雷罗州的检察长表示，至少需要两周时间才能确定那些烧焦的尸体是否就是失踪的学生。

黑帮成员告诉有关官员， 有数十名伊瓜拉警察属于当地一个叫做“勇士国”的有组织犯罪团伙。

在9月26和27号发生对峙后不久，当局拘捕了22名警官，并且下令逮捕该市镇的市长和保安主管。

Mexico Mass Grave

Mexico's president says there is "no place" for impunity in the disappearance of 43 student protesters, a case that implicates police officers and gang members.

President Enrique Peña Nieto held a press conference Monday to address the country two days after a mass grave was found in the state of Guerrero. A chief prosecutor has linked the burial site to the case, but investigators are awaiting DNA confirmation.

President Enrique Peña Nieto said: "We must find the truth and ensure that the law is applied to those responsible for these crimes, which are, without doubt, outrageous, painful and unacceptable."

President Nieto said the people of Mexico and the families of the missing "have every right to demand an explanation of the facts, and (demand) justice, that those responsible be found, and that impunity have no place here."

A Mexican prosecutor says two gang hitmen have confessed to helping local police kill 17 of the student protesters who disappeared 10 days ago.

Officials found 28 bodies in a mass grave in the city of Iguala on Saturday, a week after a police opened fire on buses carrying the students under circumstances that remain unclear. More than 100 bullet casings were found near the buses.

Guerrero's chief prosecutor said it would take at least two weeks to determine whether the charred remains belong to some of the missing students.

The gang members told officials that dozens of Iguala police officers belong to the Guerreros Unidos, an organized crime group in the area.

Authorities detained 22 police officers and issued arrest warrants for the town's mayor and security chief shortly after the.

**印巴在有争议的克什米尔地区交火**

印度官员说，印度和巴基斯坦在有争议的克什米尔地区互相射击，造成至少8名平民受伤。

印巴星期天开始在克什米尔相互射击。星期一的冲突造成9名平民死亡，几十人受伤。这是10多年来死伤人数最多的一次。

这是2003年以来最严重的破坏停火事件。印巴2003年同意在克什米尔实现停火。

边境安全部队总干事帕塔克告诉记者，巴基斯坦军人把印军的40个哨所作为袭击目标，印度军队进行了报复。

印度官员指责巴基斯坦军人向印度境内发射迫击炮弹，并用机关枪进行扫射。克什米尔印度一侧的数百名村民被迫逃离。

印度内务部统一大臣芮吉朱说，印军对巴基斯坦炮击作出回应。

印度上个月在巴基斯坦官员与克什米尔分离主义分子会谈后取消了印巴会谈。印度说，巴基斯坦必须在新德里和分离主义分子之间做出选择。

India-Pakistan Clashes in Kashmir Leave 8 Wounded

Indian officials say at least eight civilians have been wounded in cross-border firing in the disputed Kashmir region.
The exchange of fire between India and Pakistan began Sunday. On Monday, the violence claimed the heaviest casualties in more than a decade when nine civilians, both Indian and Pakistani, were killed and dozens wounded.
It has been called one of the worst cease-fire violations since 2003, when the two countries agreed to a truce along their volatile border.

The Director General of Border Security Forces, D. G. Pathak, told reporters Tuesday that 40 Indian army posts were targeted by Pakistani soldiers. He says Indian soldiers have retaliated.

Indian officials accuse Pakistani soldiers of firing mortars and machine guns into Indian territory. The latest violence has prompted hundreds of villagers living along the border in Indian Kashmir to flee.

Indian Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, Kiren Rijiju, said Indian soldiers are responding to the firing.

India called off talks with Pakistan last month after the Pakistani High Commissioner held a round of talk with Kashmiri separatists. India said Pakistan has to choose between talking to New Delhi or the separatists.
