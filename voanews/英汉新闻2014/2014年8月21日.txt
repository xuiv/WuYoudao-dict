**泰国议会推选巴育为新总理**

由军方主导的泰国议会推选巴育将军为新总理。近三个月前，巴育发动一场不流血政变，夺取了政权。

星期四，议员们一致推选现年60岁的陆军司令巴育出任总理，由于巴育是唯一的候选人，这一结果早在人们的意料之中。把英拉总理的政府赶下台后，巴育一直领导着军政府。

巴育下月将辞去陆军司令职务。他计划执掌大权，直到2015年举行新选举。

自2006年以来，泰国一直处于政治动乱之中。在2006年的军事政变中，英拉的哥哥他信被罢黜。他信和英拉遭到曼谷传统政治精英的激烈反对。

Thai Coup Leader Elected Prime Minister

Thailand's military-ruled parliament has elected General Prayuth Chan-ocha as the country's new prime minister, nearly three months after he seized power in a bloodless coup.

Thursday's unanimous election of the 60-year-old army chief was a foregone conclusion, since he was the only candidate for the post. Prayuth has led the junta since forcing Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra's government out of power.

Prayuth will step down as army chief next month. He plans to stay in power until new elections are held in late 2015.

Thailand has been plagued by political unrest since 2006, when former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, Yingluck Shinawatra's older brother, was ousted in a military coup in 2006. Thaksin and his sister were bitterly opposed by Bangkok's traditionalist political elite.

美国国土安全部星期三发布公告说， 一个不知名的活动分子团体计划于星期四举行“全国愤怒日”，抗议警察开枪打死黑人青年布朗。

公告说， 没有迹象显示抗议会变成暴力活动，但是公告说，弗格森镇最近的抗议活动导致暴力、财产破坏和拘捕。

一个调查布朗中枪身亡事件的大陪审团星期三开始听取证词。陪审团将在密苏里州克莱顿市对有关证据进行审查，并决定是否起诉8月9日开枪打死布朗的警察威尔逊。

威尔逊目前带薪休假。布朗的家人和支持者要求逮捕威尔逊。

Streets of US Town Calm Following Days of Violence

The streets of the midwestern U.S. town of Ferguson, Missouri have been much calmer overnight, following 11 days of unrest after a local police officer shot and killed an unarmed black teenager.

Police reported only six arrests, about 40 fewer than the night before.

A police official said authorities had to respond to fewer incidents, noting there were no shootings, Molotov cocktails or fires. He said police seized no handguns.

Demonstrators have been taking to the streets to voice anger at the August 9 shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown.

On Wednesday, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder met in Ferguson with community leaders and residents of the town, saying he has assigned the federal government's "most experienced agents and prosecutors" to the case. Holder also spent time with Michael Brown's parents and promised them a "fair and independent inquiry" into the death of their son

In other news, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a bulletin Wednesday drawing attention to plans by an activist group (Anonymous) for nationwide protests against the death of Brown. The group has called for a national "Day of Rage" on Thursday.

The bulletin said there is no indication the protests are expected to become violent. But it said recent protests in Ferguson have resulted in violence, property damage and arrests.

Also Wednesday, a grand jury investigating the fatal shooting of Brown began hearing evidence in the case. The grand jury will review evidence and determine whether to charge officer Darren Wilson in the death of the teenager.

Wilson is on paid leave, with Brown's family and supporters calling for his arrest.
