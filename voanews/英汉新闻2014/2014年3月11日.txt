**一名持被窃护照登失联班机者与恐怖主义无关**

马来西亚警方说，有两人持被窃护照登上失联班机，其中一人看来与恐怖主义没有关联。

马来西亚警察总长巴卡尔星期二说，这名19岁的伊朗人很可能试图移民德国，他的母亲正在德国等候他。

持被窃护照登机的另一人的身份仍在调查中。有人曾暗示这两名持被窃护照登机者与恐怖袭击阴谋有关，但就目前情况而言，这种可能性看来已经减小。

这架波音777客机上星期六从吉隆坡起飞大约一小时后在雷达上消失，而且没有发出呼救信号，此后再也没有发现这架班机的踪迹。

星期二，搜索马来西亚航空公司失联班机的范围扩大，同时机上239人的亲属做好应对不幸消息的准备。

参加搜索行动的数十船只和飞机都未能发现任何线索，而早些时候曾有报告说，可能看到了这架班机的残骸碎片和油迹。

搜索范围已经扩大到远远超出这架班机航线的地区，延伸到距离班机失联地点185公里处，包括陆地。

马来西亚官员正在研究可能导致这架班机失事的所有因素，包括爆炸、劫机、驾驶失误以及机械故障。

Man With Stolen Passport on Malaysia Jet Had No Terror Links

Malaysian police say one of the two passengers who used stolen passports to board a missing passenger jet does not appear to have links to terrorism.

National Police Chief Khalid Abu Bakar said Tuesday the 19-year-old Iranian national was likely trying to migrate to Germany, where his mother was waiting.

The other man's identity is still under investigation. But the development appears to reduce the likelihood they were involved in a terror plot, as some had suggested.

There has been no trace of the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 since it disappeared from radar without any distress calls Saturday, about an hour after leaving Kuala Lumpur.

The search for a missing jetliner expanded Tuesday, as relatives of the 239 people on board prepared to deal with expected bad news.

Dozens of ships and planes involved in the search have failed to turn up any leads, following earlier reports that possible debris or spilled oil was located.

The search has expanded well beyond the plane's scheduled flight path. It now spans a radius of 185 kilometers from where the jet disappeared, including areas on land.

Malaysian officials have been exploring a wide range of scenarios that may have brought down the Beijing-bound jet, including an explosion, hijackers, pilot error or mechanical failure.

**法称对俄制裁可能本周实施**

被推翻的乌克兰总统亚努科维奇星期二指责说，克里米亚脱离乌克兰的举动是那些反对他的人造成的。他说，他仍然是乌克兰的总统与武装部队总司令。

亚努科维奇在俄罗斯的顿河畔罗斯托夫讲了这番话。这是他逃离基辅以来的第二次公开露面。他在持续了几个月的反政府抗议之后被赶下台。

亚努科维奇指责乌克兰临时政府领导人是“极端分子”。他说，新政府计划在5月25日举行的选举是非法的。

他还放重话批评美国以及美国对乌克兰临时政府提供的10亿美元的贷款担保。他说，美国政府无权“把钱给土匪”。

与此同时，法国外长法比尤斯星期二对法国国际广播电台说，如果莫斯科不对平息克里米亚危机的建议作出积极回应，西方国家最早在这个星期就有可能对俄罗斯实施制裁。

亲俄武装控制了乌克兰的克里米亚半岛，俄罗斯和西方为此陷入紧张对峙。克里米亚危机是上个月亚努科维奇被推翻后爆发的。

France: Russia Sanctions over Ukraine Could Come This Week

Ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych blamed his opponents Tuesday for Crimea's moves to break away from Ukraine and said he remains the country's president and commander-in-chief.

Mr. Yanukovych spoke from Rostov-on-Don, Russia in his second public appearance since he fled Kyiv last month following months of anti-government protests.

Denouncing Ukraine's interim authorities as "extremists," the ousted leader called the new government's planned May 25 elections "illegitimate" and "illegal."

He also had strong words for the United States and its offer of $1 billion in loan guarantees to the interim government, saying the U.S. government does not have the right to "give money to bandits."

Meanwhile, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told France Inter radio Tuesday the West could impose sanctions against Russia as early as this week if Moscow does not respond positively to proposals to calm the crisis in Crimea.

Russia and the West are locked in a tense standoff over pro-Russian forces' seizure of the Ukrainian peninsula. The crisis in Crimea began late last month after Mr. Yanukovych's ouster.
