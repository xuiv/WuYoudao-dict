**美官员：奥巴马授权在叙上空进行侦察飞行**

白宫一名高层官员说，美国总统奥巴马已经授权在叙利亚上空进行侦察飞行。

这位官员星期一晚间说，奥巴马没有批准采取军事行动，但美国正准备打击伊斯兰国武装分子的选择性军事方案。伊斯兰国武装分子占领了叙利亚东部以及伊拉克北部和西部的大片地区。

美国战机曾对伊拉克进行空袭，帮助伊拉克和库尔德军队夺回激进分子占领的地区，包括摩苏尔大坝。这座水坝对伊拉克很多地区的供电至关重要。
五角大楼官员表示，有必要在叙利亚境内和境外对伊斯兰国实施打击。

这一行动由于叙利亚内战而变得复杂化。白宫官员说，奥巴马总统不希望美国的行动被看做对叙利亚总统阿萨德的援助。阿萨德屡次将国内冲突归咎于“恐怖分子”。叙利亚内战已经持续了3年多。

US Official: Obama Approves Surveillance Flights Over Syria

A senior White House official says U.S. President Barack Obama has authorized surveillance flights over Syria.

The official said late Monday that Mr. Obama has not approved any military action, but that the U.S. is preparing military options for combating the Islamic State fighters who have taken over large areas in eastern Syria and northern and western Iraq.

U.S. planes have been carrying out airstrikes in Iraq, helping Iraqi and Kurdish forces take back territory from the militants, including a dam in Mosul that is key to providing power to many in Iraq.

Pentagon officials have expressed the need to go after the Islamic State group on both sides of the border.

The operation is complicated by the ongoing civil war in Syria. White House officials say Mr. Obama does not want U.S. action to be seen as aiding Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has repeatedly blamed "terrorists" for the conflict that has raged in his country for more than three years.

**俄乌领导人周二举行会谈**

乌克兰总统波罗申科星期二将会见俄罗斯总统普京，同时基辅再次指责莫斯科在乌克兰东部煽动亲俄叛乱活动。

欧盟高层官员也将参加在白俄罗斯城市明斯克举行的会议，这是为结束持续5个月的冲突而采取的最新外交努力。这场冲突已造成2000多人死亡。

一天前，波罗申科解散了乌克兰议会，并决定于10月26日提前举行选举。他说，选举对于“清理”议会是必要的。

波罗申科表示，2012年举行的上次议会选举既不自由，也不公正。他说，大多数议员已经失去乌克兰人民的信任。波罗申科还指出，“相当一部分”议员支持乌克兰东部的亲俄分离分子。

乌克兰军方星期一说，已经阻止了一支进入乌克兰东南部的俄罗斯坦克和装甲车队。基辅表示，俄罗斯战斗人员装扮成乌克兰叛乱分子。乌克兰当局说，至少两辆俄罗斯坦克被击毁。

莫斯科尚未对有关入侵的指称发表评论。这是有关莫斯科试图干预乌克兰分离主义叛乱的最新报道。

Russia, Ukraine Leaders to Meet in New Peace Push

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko meets Tuesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, as Kyiv levels new accusations against Moscow of fueling a pro-Russian insurgency in eastern Ukraine.

The meeting in Minsk, Belarus, which also includes senior European Union officials, represents a fresh diplomatic push to end five months of fighting that has left over 2,000 people dead.

It comes a day after President Poroshenko dissolved parliament and called for early elections on October 26. In a televised statement, he said the vote is necessary in order to "cleanse" parliament.

Mr. Poroshenko said the last parliamentary election in 2012 was neither free nor fair. He said most lawmakers have lost the Ukrainian people's trust, noting there are "quite a few" members of parliament who support pro-Russian separatists in the east.

Also Monday, the Ukrainian military said it halted a column of Russian tanks and armored vehicles that had crossed into southeastern Ukraine. Kyiv says the fighters were disguised as rebels. It said at least two of the tanks have been destroyed.

Moscow has not commented on the alleged intrusion, which is the latest reported attempt by Moscow to intervene in the separatist insurgency.
