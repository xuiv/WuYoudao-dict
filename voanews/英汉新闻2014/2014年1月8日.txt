**五角大楼宣布在韩国增加驻军**

五角大楼宣布向韩国增派8百人的部队以及作战坦克和其它军事装备，华盛顿寻求反击来自朝鲜的任何威胁。

在美国国防部星期二宣布增兵之际，美国国务卿克里与韩国外长尹炳世在华盛顿举行了会晤。克里在会谈中向尹炳世保证华盛顿将信守为韩国提供核保护的承诺。他说：“这样我们就可以面对任何威胁。”

克里表示，他和尹炳世高度重视朝鲜的挑战，尤其是最近几周在平壤发生的事件。

克里看来指的是最近平壤的政治清洗，包括朝鲜领导人金正恩的姑父被处决。

去年12月处死朝鲜劳动党政治局中权力很大的张成泽，被一些西方分析人士认为是金正恩巩固权力的举措，另外一些人则认为是朝鲜统治集团政治不稳定的证据。

Pentagon Announces New Troop Deployment to South Korea

The Pentagon has announced the deployment of an additional 800 troops to South Korea, along with combat tanks and other military hardware, as Washington seeks to counter any regional threats from North Korea.

Tuesday's deployment announcement came as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met in Washington with his South Korean counterpart, Yun Byung-se. Kerry used the meeting to assure Yun of Washington's commitment to South Korea's nuclear defense, in his words, "so that we are prepared to face any threat."

Kerry said the two diplomats are "deeply focused on the challenge of North Korea, particularly with events that have taken place in recent weeks" in Pyongyang.

His comments appeared to reference a recent political purge that included the execution of the uncle of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

The killing in December of Jang Song Thaek, a powerful member of the politburo, is seen by some Western analysts as a move by Kim to consolidate power, and by others as evidence of political instability within the North Korean hierarchy.


**中俄船只冲出南极浮冰区**

来自南极的报道说，中国破冰船“雪龙号”和俄罗斯科学考察船“绍卡利斯基院士号”星期二冲出浮冰区，驶入净水域。

中国官方的新华社从“雪龙号”报道说，这艘破冰船困在浮冰区将近一星期后，于北京时间星期二晚间驶入净水域。 “雪龙号”上的直升机营救受困的“绍卡利斯基院士号”上的52名乘客后，这艘破冰船困在浮冰中。

“绍卡利斯基院士号”去年11月28日从新西兰启航，试图重走澳大利亚探险家莫森在1百年前的南极航程，于12月24日困在南极浮冰区。

有关当局星期二晚间说，美国海岸警卫队的破冰船“北极星号”本星期早些时候奉命启航救援，而现在已无必要，所以将继续执行原来的任务，为南极的一个美国基地运送给养。

Chinese, Russian Vessels Break Free from Antarctic Ice

Reports from Antarctica say a Chinese icebreaker and a Russian research vessel broke free Tuesday from thick ice, with both vessels moving toward open waters.

China's official Xinhua news agency, reporting from on board the Xue Long, said the ship reached open waters late Tuesday Beijing time after spending nearly a week icebound. The breaker became trapped and isolated after using one of its helicopters to rescue passengers from the stranded Russian research ship Akademik Shokalskiy.

The Russian vessel left New Zealand November 28 trying to recreate Australian explorer Douglas Mawson's century-old voyage to Antarctica, before getting stuck December 24. The Chinese breaker got stuck after rescuing the Russian vessel's 52 passengers.

Authorities said late Tuesday the services of U.S. Coast Guard ice breaker Polar Star, dispatched earlier this week to help, were no longer needed. The ship will now continue on its original resupply mission to a key U.S. base on the frozen continent.
