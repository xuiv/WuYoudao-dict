**Syria Airstrikes Target IS Oil Facilities**

VOA News

Airstrikes hit oil refineries near Syria's border with Turkey early Sunday in the ongoing offensive against Islamic State militants.

A U.S.-led military coalition has targeted similar facilities in the last week to stop the flow of millions of dollars in daily oil production revenue to the group, which has taken over parts of Syria and Iraq in recent months.

The U.S. Defense Department said coalition warplanes on Saturday struck a northern Syrian town that has been under militant siege for nearly two weeks.

Activists and Kurdish officials said Islamic State fighters fired rockets into the town, known both as Kobane and Ain al-Arab. At least 12 people were reported wounded in the rocket attacks, while no immediate casualty estimates were released for the coalition strikes.

The Islamic State siege at Kobane has sent 160,000 refugees streaming into Turkey, while hundreds of Kurdish fighters inside Turkey have crossed into the Syrian town to defend it.

联军星期天对伊斯兰国激进分子在叙利亚靠近土耳其边界的炼油设施进行空中打击。

美国领导的联军一个星期以来连续打击类似的炼油设施，以阻止伊斯兰国提炼石油所获得的收入。伊斯兰国已经占领了叙利亚和伊拉克的大片土地，通过提炼石油获得的美元数以百万计。

美国国防部说，联军战机星期六攻击了叙利亚北部城镇科班尼地区，该城镇已被极端分子围困了将近两个星期。活动人士和库尔德官员说，伊斯兰国的武装向城镇里发射火箭，造成至少12人受伤。目前还没有联军空袭是否造成人员伤亡的消息。

伊斯兰国在科班尼的围攻行动，导致16万难民涌入土耳其境内，数百名库尔德人越过土耳其境内，前往参加保卫这座叙利亚城镇的战斗。

A U.S. drone strike killed four suspected militants Sunday in Pakistan's northwest tribal region, with Islamabad's air force launching other deadly attacks near the Afghan border.

Officials in Pakistan say two missiles were fired from the unmanned U.S. aircraft. The attack killed two Arab militants and two of their local allies after they parked their vehicle near the house of militant commander Ainullah and were drinking water as they stood on the road.

The U.S. drone strikes were resumed in Pakistan in June after a six-month hiatus. At the same time, Pakistan launched a military operation in North Waziristan, with the army saying it has killed more than 1,000 militants so far.

On Sunday, the Pakistani air force said its airstrikes destroyed five insurgent hideouts, killing 15 militants.
