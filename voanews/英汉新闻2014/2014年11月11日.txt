Obama, Putin Meet with Tensions on Several Fronts

U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin have met briefly on the sidelines of a conference in Beijing, covering a few of the key global issues on which their governments do not agree.

Mr. Obama and Mr. Putin flanked Chinese President Xi Jinping and exchanged comments about the room as leaders walked into the venue for Tuesday's Asia-Pacific summit.

But away from the main talks, the White House said U.S. and Russian leaders met three times throughout the day for a total of about 15 to 20 minutes.

U.S. National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said the topics included Iran, Syria and Ukraine, but did not provide additional details.


**普京阿博特会谈 敦促加快调查马航班机坠毁事件**

俄罗斯总统普京和澳大利亚总理阿博特都认为需要加快调查马航客机在东乌克兰坠毁事件。

俄罗斯当局说，普京和阿博特星期二在北京出席亚太经合组织峰会期间举行了会谈，主要讨论了马航七月坠毁事件。

会谈受到密切关注，因为阿博特最近威胁要就俄罗斯据说卷入坠机事件质问普京。普京的发言人说澳大利亚总理显然并没有将奥式足球里的“迎面顶撞”诉诸行动。

许多西方国家指责俄罗斯支持的分裂分子今年7月击落马航班机。当时这架飞机从阿姆斯特丹起飞后经过叛军控制的乌克兰东部前往吉隆坡。

Russia, Australia Leaders Urge Quicker MH17 Probe

Russian President Vladimir Putin and Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott have agreed on the need to speed up the investigation into the crash of a Malaysia Airlines flight in eastern Ukraine.

A Kremlin statement says talks on the July crash dominated a Tuesday meeting between the two leaders on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Summit being held in Beijing.

The meeting was being watched closely since Prime Minister Abbott had recently threatened to aggressively confront President Putin about Russia's alleged involvement in the July crash.

Mr. Putin's spokesman said the Australian leader apparently did not try to follow through on his threat to "shirtfront," or shoulder-charge, the Russian president, a technique used in Australian Rules football.

Many Western countries accuse Russian-backed separatists of shooting down the plane as it flew through rebel-held eastern Ukraine en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur.
