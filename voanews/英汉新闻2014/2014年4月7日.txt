**澳军舰测到与失踪客机黑匣子相符的信号**

澳大利亚官员说，一艘海军舰只又探测到与马航失踪客机黑匣子相符的信号。

搜寻行动负责人休斯顿星期一在珀斯对记者说，星期日的这一进展是在印度洋海域搜寻这架波音777客机以来“最有希望的线索”。

休斯顿强调指出，还需要进一步对此加以证实，这可能需要几天时间，但美国海军脉冲信号探测器捕捉到的信息非常令人鼓舞。

休斯顿说，澳大利亚军舰“海洋之盾号”拖曳的探测器捕捉到的信号持续了两小时20分钟，后来又持续了13分钟。休斯顿表示，这些信号与失踪客机黑匣子以及驾驶舱录音器发射的信号相符。

休斯顿说，一旦确定了信号最后发射的大致位置，就将派出自动水下航行器展开调查。

Searchers Hear Signals Consistent With Missing Plane's Black Boxes

Australian officials say a navy ship has detected new signals "consistent" with the black box data recorders of the missing Malaysia Airlines passenger jet.

Search chief Angus Houston told reporters Monday in Perth the development during the past day is the "most promising lead" so far in the search for the Boeing 777 in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Australia.

He emphasized that further confirmation is needed, which could take days, but he described the information picked up by the U.S. Navy ping detector as "very encouraging."

Houston said the detector towed by the Australian ship Ocean Shield had contact that lasted two hours and 20 minutes, followed by another contact of 13 minutes. He said this would be "consistent with transmissions from both the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder."

Once a general position of the latest signals is confirmed, he said an underwater autonomous vehicle can be sent to investigate.

**乌总理：俄是东乌周日动乱黑手**

乌克兰总理指责俄罗斯支持乌克兰分离主义者的示威活动，包括星期日占领乌克兰东部三所城市的政府建筑的行动。

总理亚采纽克星期一在内阁会议上说，乌克兰东部城市顿涅茨克、卢甘斯克和哈尔科夫三座城市爆发的动乱是由俄罗斯幕后操控的。他说，这些示威活动显然是破坏局势稳定并让“外国”军队越境占领乌克兰领土计划的一部分。

亚采纽克说，俄军仍然驻扎在距离乌克兰边境30公里之内的地方。

路透社报道说，乌克兰代总统图尔奇诺夫也指责俄罗斯要为星期日的示威事件负责。他指责俄罗斯试图让克里米亚的局面重演。图尔奇诺夫誓言将采取反恐措施。

Ukraine PM: Russia Backed Sunday's Unrest in the East

Ukraine's prime minister has accused Russia of backing separatist demonstrations, including the seizure of government buildings Sunday in three eastern Ukrainian cities.

Arseniy Yatsenyuk told a Cabinet meeting Monday that Russia is behind the unrest that rose up in the eastern cities of Donetsk, Luhansk, and Kharkiv. He said the demonstrations are clearly part of a plan to destabilize the situation and allow "foreign" troops to cross the border and seize Ukrainian territory.

Mr. Yatsenyuk said Russian troops remain stationed within 30 kilometers of Ukraine.

Reuters news agency reports Ukraine's acting president, Oleksandr Turchnyov, also blamed Russia for Sunday's demonstrations and accused them of "playing out the Crimean scenario." He vowed anti-terrorist measures will be carried out.
