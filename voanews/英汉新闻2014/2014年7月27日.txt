**哈马斯同意停火**

哈马斯武装说，他们同意在加沙开始实行一项新的24小时人道主义停火方案，从当地时间下午2：00（即中国时间晚7：00）开始。

以色列还没有对哈马斯的最新表态作出回应。

哈马斯星期天发表了这项声明，声明发表前不久，以色列恢复了对加沙地带的炮袭，以此回击来自巴勒斯坦领土的火箭攻击。在延长停火时段结束前几个小时，来自加沙一连串的火箭弹袭击的了伊拉克。
以色列军方星期天说，由于哈马斯在停火期间不断向以方发动火箭弹袭击，以色列军方决定恢复针对加沙地带的空中、海上以及地面行动。

巴勒斯坦说，以色列恢复攻击以来，又有3人在加沙丧生。

以色列星期六曾同意继续在原12小时停火的基础上再停火24小时，知道星期天当地时间午夜为止。

不过以色列表示，在停火延长期间，以方将继续对哈马斯的火箭弹袭击作出回应，同时继续搜索并摧毁哈马斯用于向以色列境内偷运武器和人员的地下通道。

哈马斯拒绝接受停火延长提议，并坚持以色列必须从加沙撤军。巴勒斯坦方面说，已经有超过一千名巴勒斯坦人在这轮冲突中丧生，其中多数是平民，包括很多儿童。

以色列说有43名以军士兵和两名平民丧生。

Hamas Agrees to Gaza Cease-Fire

Hamas militants say they will now agree to a new 24-hour humanitarian cease-fire in Gaza, starting at 2 p.m. local time (1100 UTC).

Israel has yet to respond to Hamas on the latest call for a cease-fire.

Hamas made the statement Sunday shortly after Israel resumed its raids in Gaza following rocket fire from the Palestinian territory. A barrage of rockets were shot into Israel from Gaza hours before another cease-fire was scheduled to end.

Israel's military said "following Hamas' incessant rocket fire throughout the humanitarian window, which was agreed upon for the welfare of the civilian population in Gaza, the IDF will now resume its aerial, naval and ground activity in the Gaza Strip."

Palestinians say three people have been killed in Gaza since the shelling resumed.

Israel had agreed Saturday to continue the original 12-hour truce in Gaza another 24 hours, through Sunday at midnight local time (( 2100 UTC.))

However, Israel said it would respond to Hamas rocket fire during the extension and would continue to search for and destroy tunnels Hamas uses to smuggle weapons and fighters into Israel.

Hamas rejected the extension, saying Israel first had to withdraw its forces from Gaza.

Palestinians say their death toll has exceeded 1,000. Most of those killed have been civilians, including many children.

Israel says 43 Israeli soldiers and two civilians have died.
