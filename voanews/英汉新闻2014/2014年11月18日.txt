**安倍宣布提前举行选举**

日本首相安倍晋三要求提前举行选举, 并推迟实施有争议的上调销售税计划，以巩固政治支持，避免经济衰退。

安倍在星期二的记者会上宣布本星期解散国会，并于12月提前两个月举行选举。

他没有透露具体的选举日期，但是日本媒体报道说很可能在12月中旬，有可能是12月14日。

安倍还将提高销售税的时间推迟18个月，到2017年4月。

安倍的做法在人们意料之中。星期一公布的第三季度经济数据意外显示，日本经济再次陷入衰退。日本在工业化国家中负债最为庞大。安倍提高销售税的目的是减少日本的巨额债务。日本销售税今年4月初步上调之后，经济出现问题。

安倍2012年出任首相时保证要通过大量公共开支和改革等刺激经济发展。安倍的这个计划常常被称为“安倍经济学”。

虽然日本经济不好，但安倍的支持率仍然比较高。他所在的自民党拥有议会坚实多数，有可能在选举中赢得更多席位。

Abe called for snap elections

Japan's prime minister has called for snap elections and delayed a controversial sales tax increase, as part of efforts to solidify his political support and fight off recession.

At a news conference Tuesday, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced he will dissolve parliament this week and hold elections next month, two years ahead of schedule.

No exact date for the election was given, but Japanese media reported it likely will be held sometime in mid-December, possibly December 14.

Mr. Abe also said he will put off raising the country's consumption tax for another 18 months, until April 2017.

The moves were expected after data on Monday showed Tokyo unexpectedly fell back into recession in the third quarter. Japan's economy has struggled following an initial sales tax hike in April.

The tax increases are part of the prime minister's efforts to reduce Japan's massive national debt, which is among the largest in the industralized world.

Mr. Abe took office in 2012, promising to improve the slumping economy through massive public stimulus spending and reforms. The plan is often called "Abenomics."

Despite the struggling economy, Mr. Abe's approval ratings remain relatively high. His Liberal Democratic Party has a solid majority in parliament and could stand to gain further ground with an early vote.

克里星期二与英国外交大臣哈蒙德一起与记者会面时表示，这个星期的会谈“至关重要”。

伊朗媒体星期二引述伊朗外长扎里夫的话说，现在仍有可能达成协议。扎里夫同时告诫国际谈判代表“不要对伊朗提出过份要求”。

Kerry, Zarif Say Iran Nuclear Deal Possible as Deadline Draws Near

Secretary of State John Kerry says he is hopeful the U.S. and group of five other world powers can reach a deal with Iran on the country's nuclear program, but that he will not make any predictions.

Negotiators from Iran and the so-called P5+1 group that includes the U.S., Britain, China, France, Russia and Germany are meeting again Tuesday in Vienna.

They have less than a week to reach an agreement before their November 24 deadline.

Speaking Tuesday alongside British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, Kerry called this week's talks "critical."

Iranian media quoted Foreign Minister Javad Zarif saying Tuesday that a deal is still possible and expressing caution toward the international side to not make "excessive demands" of Iran.
