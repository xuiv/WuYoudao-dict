Lavrov: Troops in Crimea Protecting Russian Citizens


Russia's foreign minister has defended the increasing presence of his country's troops in Ukraine's Crimean peninsula, ahead of a meeting with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who is hoping to prevent a further escalation in the region.

Sergei Lavrov said Monday that the use of Russian troops in Crimea is necessary "until the normalization of the political situation" in Crimea. He spoke at the opening of the U.N. Human Rights Council session in Geneva and said his country's troops are protecting Russian nationals.

Ukraine has accused Russia of carrying out a military invasion and urged Moscow to withdraw its forces, which have surrounded Ukrainian military bases across Crimea and set up roadblocks.

Russian media reported that Russian fighter jets flew through Ukraine's airspace over the Black Sea overnight Sunday into Monday.

Russia's foreign ministry also says Russia and China have coinciding views on the situation in Ukraine, while the leaders of the G7 group of nations are condemning what they say is Russia's "clear violation" of Ukraine's sovereignty.

Lavrov spoke to his Chinese counterpart phone on Monday. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said China wants to see a political solution to the situation.

"We understand the historical background of the Ukraine issue, and the complexity of the current reality. As I have said yesterday, to get to this point today, things happened for a reason. We hope that all parties can, through dialogue and and consultation, find a political solution, prevent further escalation and work together to safeguard peace and stability in the region."

The G7 leaders issued a joint statement calling on Russia to address any concerns it has with Ukraine through either direct negotiations or mediation led by the U.N. or the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). The G7 includes the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan.

**奥巴马会晤内塔尼亚胡 努力推动中东和平**

奥巴马总统星期一将在白宫会晤以色列总理内塔尼亚胡。这将是奥巴马政府为打破僵局、推动达成中东和平的最后协议所作的最新努力。

奥巴马总统将试图说服内塔尼亚胡同意接受最后一轮谈判的框架。这轮谈判将导致创建一个与以色列共存的巴勒斯坦国。

美国国务卿克里去年7月发起新一轮和谈，目标是在4月底以前达成最后协议。但是随着谈判陷入僵局，奥巴马政府修改了目标。

奥巴马总统星期天接受彭博新闻社采访时警告说，以色列和巴勒斯坦人达成最后协议的时间不多了。他说，如果和谈失败了，美国就无法保护以色列不在国际舞台上遭到反弹，这包括越来越多的抵制威胁和外交孤立。

但是内塔尼亚胡在启程前往华盛顿前对记者说，以色列将继续顶住他所说的要求达成协议的“各种压力。”

Obama Enters Middle East Peace Efforts in Talks with Netanyahu

U.S. President Barack Obama will attempt to break an impasse in the latest efforts to reach a final Middle East peace accord when he hosts Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House Monday.

Mr. Obama will try and convince Mr. Netanyahu to agree to a framework on a final round of negotiations that would lead to the creation of a Palestinian state existing side-by-side with Israel. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry launched a new round of peace talks last July, with the goal of reaching a final agreement by next month. But the Obama administration revised the goal as the talks stalled

In an interview published Sunday by Bloomberg, the U.S. president warned that "time is running out" for Israel to reach a final accord with the Palestinians. He said if the peace talks fail, the U.S. would be unable to defend Israel from a backlash on the international stage, including a growing threat of boycotts and diplomatic isolation.

But Mr. Netanyahu told reporters before his departure for Washington that Israel will continue to reject what he called the "various pressures" to reach a deal.
