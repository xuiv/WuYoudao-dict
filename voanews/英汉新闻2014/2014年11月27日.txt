**美国人欢度感恩节**

美国人星期四与家人团聚，享用美餐，购买打折商品，欢度感恩节。

感恩节大餐以火鸡为主，加上一些传统配餐和餐后小吃。这是感恩节的传统。感恩节是每年11月的第4个星期四。

在感恩节前夕，美国总统奥巴马及其家人来到华盛顿一个向穷人提供食品、衣服和其他服务的中心，为人们分发食品。

星期三早些时候，奥巴马依照历任美国总统的一项特别传统，“赦免”了一只火鸡。作为“赦免”候选者的是两只火鸡，一只叫“奶酪”，另一只叫“迈克”。一星期来，白宫举办了一次网上投票，让人们投票决定“赦免”哪只火鸡。虽然“奶酪”最终胜出，但“迈克”也被一道“赦免”了。

Americans Celebrate Thanksgiving

Americans are marking the annual Thanksgiving holiday Thursday with family gatherings, meals and bargain shopping.

Feasts centering on turkeys with an array of traditional sides and desserts are a tradition for the holiday that falls on the fourth Thursday in November.

On the eve of the holiday, U.S. President Barack Obama and his family handed out food to clients of a center in Washington that provides food, clothing and other services to the poor.

Earlier in the day, Mr. Obama followed a specifically presidential tradition of "pardoning" a turkey. The White House ran an online contest in the past week asking people to vote on which bird should get the pardon, "Cheese" or fellow turkey "Mac." While Cheese won the official pardon, both turkeys - each weighing about 23 kilograms - will be spared the chopping block.


**泰国军政权推迟选举至2016年**

泰国军政权一名高层官员说，选举很可能将推迟到2016年举行。这进一步拖延了军方承诺的民主过渡。

泰国副总理普拉威星期四对记者说，宪法起草完毕后，很可能将在2016年初举行选举。

兼任国防部长的普拉威表示，推迟选举的一个原因是存在着反对军方领导层的“因素”，但他未做具体说明。

泰国法院在反对派抗议持续数月后罢免了英拉的总理职务，随后军方接掌政权。

Thailand Junta Delays Elections Until 2016

A senior official in Thailand's military junta says elections likely will not be held until 2016, further delaying the military's promised democratic transition.

Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan told reporters Thursday elections will likely be held "around the start of 2016, once the constitution is drafted."

Prawit, who is also defense minister, said one reason for the delay is the existence of unspecified "elements" that are opposed to the military leadership.

The military took power after Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra was ousted by a court following months of sometimes violent opposition protests.
