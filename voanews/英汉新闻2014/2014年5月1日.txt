Kerry joins foreign ministers from Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya for South Sudan Talks

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is in Ethiopia for talks Thursday with the Ethiopian, Ugandan and Kenyan foreign ministers about halting the conflict in neighboring South Sudan.

Kerry arrived late Wednesday in Addis Ababa, where a senior State Department official has said the secretary will deliver "tough messages" for both the South Sudanese government and rebels.

The United States has threatened travel and financial sanctions on those responsible for violence that has displaced more than a million people.

State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said Wednesday that Kerry will use his multi-stop trip in Africa to discuss a range of issues and initiatives, including the U.S. program to help those with HIV and AIDS.

**中俄将在东海联合举行海军演习**

中国说，本月晚些时候将与俄罗斯在东海联合举行海军演习。北京在东海与日本存在领土争端。

中国国防部发表声明说，这次例行演习将于5月底展开。演习地点是离开争议地区较远的北部，靠近上海附近海域。

中日两国长期以来围绕东海一组无人居住的岛屿存在领土争端。这些岛屿周边海域自然资源丰富，具有战略意义的航道也经过该海域。

日本2012年将一些有争议岛屿国有化，导致中日领土争端升级。中国方面采取相应措施，加紧在该海域巡逻，对东京的控制权发出挑战。

此外，中国在东海设立了防空识别区。中国规定，外国飞机在进入该区域之前必须向中方通报身份，但日本和美国无视中国的这一要求。

China, Russia to Hold Naval Drills in East China Sea

China says it will hold joint naval exercises with Russia later this month in the East China Sea, where Beijing is involved in a territorial dispute with Japan.

A statement by China's Defense Ministry said the "regular exercises" would begin in late May off the coast of Shanghai, well north of the disputed area.

China and Japan have a longstanding quarrel over a series of uninhabited islands that are surrounded by vast natural resources and strategic shipping lanes.

The dispute worsened in 2012 after Japan purchased some of the islands. China responded by increasing patrols, challenging Tokyo's control of the area.

China also declared an Air Defense Identification Zone in the East China Sea. But Japan and the U.S. have ignored Beijing's demands that all foreign aircraft identify themselves before entering the zone.
