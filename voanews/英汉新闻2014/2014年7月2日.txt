Sarkozy Investigated for Influence Peddling

Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy has been formally placed under investigation after entering police custody for questioning on Tuesday in a probe into alleged influence peddling.

Mr. Sarkozy is under suspicion of trying to use his influence to obstruct an investigation of his 2007 election campaign.

A prosecutor said Wednesday that the former French leader tried to get information from a judge about the probe.

Mr. Sarkozy's lawyer and a judge involved in the case were also placed under formal investigation.

Mr. Sarkozy turned himself in Tuesday at a police station in the Paris suburb of Nanterre. French media say this is the first time a French former head of state has been detained for investigation.

The probe involves the question of whether the late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi contributed funds to Mr. Sarkozy's 2007 presidential campaign.

Investigators are acting on evidence collected after tapping Mr. Sarkozy's phone lines.

Mr. Sarkozy has denied any wrongdoing in the case.

North Korea Fires More Projectiles off East Coast

North Korea has fired two more short-range rockets off its east coast, the third such test in less than a week.

News of the launch came from South Korea, which said the projectiles landed harmlessly in the East Sea on Wednesday.

South Korean officials said the projectiles were fired from the city of Wonsan and had a range of 180 kilometers.

They are believed to be 300-millimeter KN-09 short-range rockets fired by a multiple rocket launcher.

Pyongyang test-fired two short-range missiles Sunday and launched two other projectiles Thursday in the same area.

The launches come ahead of a state visit to South Korea this week by Chinese President Xi Jinping.

The talks, which begin Thursday, are expected to focus in large part on North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.

Mr. Xi has met twice with South Korean President Park Geun-hye since he took office. He has not met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
