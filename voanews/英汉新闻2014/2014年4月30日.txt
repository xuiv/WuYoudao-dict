菲律宾官员说，政府军与伊斯兰激进分子在南部一个偏远地区爆发战斗，至少15人死亡。

战斗于星期二爆发，一直持续到星期三清晨，地点是苏禄省的帕迪库尔镇，那里是阿布沙耶夫激进分子的根据地。

菲律宾军方说，阿布沙耶夫战斗人员试图夺回政府军星期一攻占的一个丛林营地，从而引发战斗。

有关官员说，政府军击退了伊斯兰激进分子的进攻，但至少一名政府军士兵在冲突中阵亡。

据信阿布沙耶夫组织与基地组织战斗人员有联系，该组织被指在菲律宾进行了一系列袭击和绑架活动。

人质有时被扣押在丛林营地，但从来没有关于人质被找到的报道。

阿布沙耶夫是菲律宾南部很多伊斯兰小组织之一。这些组织反对马尼拉与摩洛伊斯兰解放阵线签订和平协议。

Philippines: Military, Islamist Clashes Leave 15 Dead

Philippine officials say at least 15 people have been killed during fighting between government troops and Islamist militants in a remote southern region.

The fighting began Tuesday and continued into early Wednesday in the town of Patikul on the island province of Sulu, a stronghold of Abu Sayyaf militants.

The military says the fighting broke out when Abu Sayyaf fighters attempted to retake a jungle camp captured by government troops Monday.

Officials say the Islamist advance was successfully driven back, although at least one soldier was among those killed in the clashes.

The Islamist group is thought to have ties to al-Qaida fighters and has been blamed for a series of attacks and kidnappings in the Philippines.

Hostages are sometimes kept in the jungle camps. None were reported to be found, however.

Abu Sayyaf is among many small Islamist groups in the southern Philippines opposed to a peace deal between Manila and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front.


**俄克拉何马州注射死刑出现失误**

美国俄克拉何马州在一次毒剂注射死刑的执行过程中出现失误。犯人的身体扭动了40多分钟，最后死于心脏病发作。

俄克拉何马州狱政局说，星期二对犯人洛克特执行死刑。这是该州首次使用由三种药物混合而成的针剂。注射13分钟后，这名强奸谋杀犯的呼吸开始变得粗重，并咬紧牙关。在场的医生决定停止执行死刑。

有关官员拉下窗帘，以免在外面观看死刑过程的人们看到行刑室里发生的情况。有关官员说，在注射毒剂时，犯人出现静脉衰竭。

另一名犯人原定在洛克特之后两小时接受死刑，俄克拉荷马州州长法林决定把对他的处决推迟14天。

Oklahoma Botches Execution, Halts Others

A botched execution by lethal injection in Oklahoma left an inmate writhing on the gurney for more than 40 minutes before he eventually died from a heart attack.

Oklahoma's Department of Corrections says inmate Clayton Lockett was issued the first of the state's new three-drug lethal injection combination on Tuesday. Thirteen minutes later the convicted rapist and murderer began breathing heavily and clenching his teeth, causing the doctor on scene to halt the execution.

Officials lowered the blinds to prevent those in the viewing gallery from watching what was happening in the death chamber. Officials said there was a "vein failure" during the execution.

Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin has ordered a 14-day stay of execution for an inmate who was scheduled to die just two hours after Lockett.
