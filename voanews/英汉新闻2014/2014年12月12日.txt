**大韩航空总裁为女儿行为道歉**

韩国大韩航空公司总裁赵亮镐为他的女儿、公司副总裁赵贤娥的“愚蠢举动”表示道歉。赵贤娥因不满工作人员提供坚果的程序而迫使一个航班推迟起飞。

赵亮镐在星期五的一个记者会上鞠躬致歉，表示自己应当在教养女儿方面做得更好。

上星期，赵贤娥乘坐的航班的乘务员将一袋坚果放在她面前，而没有放在餐盘里送给她。赵贤娥为此怒不可遏，命令飞机返回登机口，并将那名乘务员赶下飞机。

此事在韩国引发广泛愤怒，迫使赵贤娥辞去其在家族所有的大韩航空公司内担任的一切职务，包括副总裁一职。

星期五，面带愧色的赵贤娥表示道歉，她用小得几乎听不到的声音对记者说，她为自己的行为表示真诚的歉意。

在一个公民组织提出批评后，韩国有关当局开始调查大韩航空是否违反了航空安全法规。

Korean Air CEO Apologizes for Daughter's 'Nut Rage'

Korean Air's CEO has apologized for what he said were the "foolish actions" of his daughter, an airline executive who delayed a flight because she was not happy with the way she was served macadamia nuts.

At a news conference Friday, Cho Yang-ho bowed in a traditional gesture of deep remorse, saying he should have done a better job raising his daughter.

Cho Hyun-ah last week became angry after a flight attendant in first class offered her nuts in a packet instead of on a plate. Cho forced the aircraft to return to the gate and kicked the attendant off the plane.

The case has prompted widespread outrage in South Korea and forced Cho from all her posts, including as vice president of the family-run airline.

A distraught-looking Cho offered her own emotional apology Friday, telling reporters in a voice that was barely audible that she is "sincerely" sorry for her actions.

Following complaints from a civil society group, South Korean authorities have started an investigation into whether Korean Air violated any aviation safety laws.

众议院星期四批准了1万1000亿美元、截至2015年9月30号的联邦政府预算。预计参议院也将通过这个预算案。

众议院共和党议长贝纳向国会议员发出警告，如果星期四不通过联邦拨款法案，哪怕是一个临时法案，那么他们就得在华盛顿一直待到圣诞节。

两党议员和奥巴马总统都敦促通过开支法案，尽管保守的共和党人对法案中未包括的内容感到愤怒，而自由派民主党人则对其中包括的一些内容表示不满。

Congress Averts Government Shutdown, For Now

U.S. President Barack Obama has signed a bill that provides a two-day extension of government funding and temporarily averts a partial federal government shutdown.

Both houses of Congress approved the heavily fought-over spending measure late Thursday, with just minutes to go before the midnight deadline.

The Senate now has until Saturday at midnight to approve a wider spending measure.

The Senate is expected follow the lead of the House of Representatives, which on Thursday passed the $1.1 trillion spending bill that funds the government through September 2015.

Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner warned lawmakers that if they did not pass a bill Thursday - even a temporary measure to fund the government - they would have to stay in Washington until Christmas.

Lawmakers from both sides and President Obama urged passage, even though conservative Republicans were angry over what was not in the bill and liberal Democrats were upset over what was there.
