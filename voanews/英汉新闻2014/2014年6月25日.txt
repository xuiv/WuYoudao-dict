**国际足联调查苏亚雷斯疑似咬人事件**

在世界杯比赛中，看来乌拉圭球员苏亚雷斯咬了一名意大利球员，国际足联已经对此事展开纪律调查程序。

国际足联要求苏亚雷斯和乌拉圭足球协会在星期三下午之前说明对这一事件的立场并提供相关证据。

星期二的这场比赛进行到第80分钟时，苏亚雷斯与意大利防守队员齐埃利尼相互推挤，录像和照片显示苏亚雷斯似乎咬了齐埃利尼的左肩。

齐埃利尼立刻捂着肩膀倒在地上，然后站起身，扯开球衣，向裁判展示肩上的红印。

裁判没有对苏亚雷斯判罚。在以往的比赛中，苏亚雷斯曾两次因咬了对方球员而遭禁赛。苏亚雷斯在赛后说，比赛中会发生这类事。

齐埃利尼的反应更加强烈，他表示，苏亚雷斯没有被罚下场是“荒唐”的。

FIFA Investigating Uruguay's Suarez After Apparent Bite

Football's (soccer's) governing body has opened disciplinary proceedings against Uruguay's Luis Suarez, after he apparently bit an Italian player during a World Cup match.

FIFA has given Suarez and the country's football association until Wednesday afternoon to give their position on the incident and any relevant evidence.

In the 80th minute of Tuesday's game, Suarez was jostling in front of the goal with Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini when video and photos show what appeared to be Suarez biting into Chiellini's left shoulder.

The Italian immediately dropped to the ground holding his shoulder, then got up and pulled back his jersey to show a red mark to the referee.

There was no foul called against Suarez, who has been banned twice before for biting opposing players. After the game he said "these are things that happen on the pitch."

Chiellini gave a harsher reaction, saying it was "ridiculous" Suarez was not ejected from the game.

China Official Visits Taiwan Amid Warming Relations

For the first time ever, China has sent a ministerial-level official to Taiwan, a visit Beijing's state media are calling a "giant leap" for cross-Strait relations.

Zhang Zhijun, who heads China's Taiwan Affairs Office, arrived at Taiwan's main airport Wednesday for the start of a four-day trip to the self-ruled island.

He will meet his Taiwanese counterpart, Wang Yu-chi, who visited Beijing in February and held Taiwan's first political talks with China since their civil war 65 years ago.

Their agenda includes the further expansion of trade ties and the establishment of consular offices in each other's territory to help facilitate closer relations.

Despite the warming relationship, much of the Taiwanese public is worried about Taiwan becoming too dependent on China, which is already a vital economic partner.
