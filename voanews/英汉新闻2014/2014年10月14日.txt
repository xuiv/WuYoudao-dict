**金正恩拄拐在国家媒体上露面**

朝鲜领导人金正恩在从公众视线中消失了40多天后首次公开露面，朝鲜官方媒体刊登的照片显示金正恩手拄拐杖。

朝鲜官方的朝中社星期二报道说，金正恩视察了一个居民住宅区和一个研究院，并在场亲临指导。金正恩经常到各地视察指导。

朝中社和朝鲜主要报纸《劳动新闻》刊登了几张金正恩的照片。金正恩在照片中微笑，左手拄着一把黑色拐杖。

报道没有说明照片是何时拍摄的，也没有提及金正恩长期没有露面和他为什么手拄拐杖。

被朝鲜大多数人近乎神化的金正恩从媒体消失后国际社会推测他可能患重病或者朝鲜政局出现问题动荡。

韩国高丽大学朝鲜研究教授林载淳对美国之音表示，平壤公布这些照片可能就是为了回应这些传言。

金正恩2011年接替他的父亲金正日成为朝鲜领导人。据信他的年龄在31岁。他上一次露面是9月3日观看他最喜欢的牡丹峰乐团演出。该乐团有五位年轻女性组成，全部是金正恩亲手挑选的。

金正恩随后缺席了几次重要的政治活动，包括9月末朝鲜无实权的第13届朝鲜最高人民会议第二次会议和上周五的朝鲜劳动党建党周年活动。

North Korean Leader Reappears in State Media Clutching Cane

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has made his first public appearance in more than 40 days, resurfacing in state media photos carrying a cane.

The official Korean Central News Agency said Tuesday Mr. Kim visited a residential district and a science institute where he gave "field guidance," a regular routine for the young leader.

KCNA, along with the country's main newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, published several photos of a smiling Mr. Kim leaning on a black cane, which he held in his left hand.

The reports did not say when the photos were taken. They also did not mention Mr. Kim's prolonged absence or explain why he was carrying the cane.

The disappearance of Mr. Kim, regarded by many North Koreans as a near divine figure, prompted global speculation he was suffering a serious health or political problem.

Lim Jae-chun, a North Korean studies professor at Korea University, tells VOA that Pyongyang may have released the photos in response to the rumors.

The North Korean leader, believed to be 31 years of age, succeeded his father Kim Jong Il in 2011. He had last been seen September 3 at a concert by his favorite pop group, the Moranbong Band, a group consisting of five young women, all hand-picked by Mr. Kim.

He then missed several high-profile political events, including a meeting of the country's ceremonial parliament in late September and last Friday's anniversary of the ruling Korean Worker's Party.

**土耳其战机空袭库尔德工人党目标**

土耳其空军对该国东南部的库尔德工人党目标进行空袭。这是双边在两年前展开和平进程以来，土耳其政府首次对库尔德工人党发动重大空袭。

土耳其《每日新闻报》报道，军方战机星期天轰炸了库尔德工人党在哈卡里省的目标。

报道称空袭是为了报复库尔德工人党在该地区对土耳其军事哨所的攻击。土耳其国内正因为政府对打击伊斯兰国不够积极而出现紧张局势。

最近几个星期，抗议民众要求政府出兵打击在边界附近包围科巴尼的伊斯兰国武装。

库尔德工人党上个月呼吁所有库尔德人武装起来，捍卫库尔德人口占多数的科巴尼。

在土耳其政府与库尔德工人党间的冲突，也使得双边在2012年展开的和平进程陷入危机。此前，安卡拉政府与库尔德反叛分子间长达30年的战斗，导致4万多人死亡。

Turkey Bombs Kurdish Separatist Targets

Media reports in Turkey say government warplanes have bombed Kurdish nationalist rebels in southeast of the country in the first significant air operation against the group since peace talks began two years ago.

The Hurriyet newspaper says the jets hit Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) targets in Hakkari province on Sunday.

The bombings are said to be a response to shootings by the PKK at a military outpost in the area. They come amid increased internal tension over Turkey's inaction against the Islamic State.

Protesters in recent weeks have called for the Turkish military to intervene across the Syrian border, where IS militants have surrounded Kobani.

The PKK issued a call to arms in September for Kurds to defend the largely Kurdish town.

The renewed conflict between Turkey and the PKK jeopardizes a fragile peace process launched by Ankara and rebel leadership in 2012 after three decades of insurgency killed more than 40,000 people.
