Suicide Blast Kills 42 in Yemen's Capital

A suicide bomber has killed at least 42 people in Yemen's capital in an attack apparently targeting Shi'ite Houthi rebels.

The blast happened Thursday in the Tahrir Square section of central Sanaa, which the rebels have controlled since last month.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing. In southern Yemen, a suicide car bombing also killed at least 20 soldiers.

The Houthis staged weeks of protests calling for better power sharing and a new government before reaching a U.N.-brokered deal in September.

They planned new demonstrations Thursday rejecting President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi's appointment of Ahmed Awad bin Mubarak as the new prime minister. But bin Mubarak has turned down the nomination.

State media quoted bin Mubarak as saying he wanted to avoid further disagreement in the country.


**一名澳大利亚护士接受埃博拉病毒检测**

一名澳大利亚护士在出现埃博拉症状之后，正在进行医学检测。与此同时，国际社会继续努力阻止这种病毒的蔓延。

澳大利亚昆士兰州的卫生主管简妮特•扬表示，今年57岁的这名女性在塞拉利昂为埃博拉病人工作回国后不久，出现低度的发烧。

测试结果预计星期五宣布。扬强调说，即使这名女性感染了埃博拉，公众也不必担心疫情会爆发。

出现事态最新进展的一天之前，在美国德州达拉斯被确诊的首名埃博拉病人，经过10天的治疗之后丧生。

托马斯•邓肯上个月20号从他的祖籍国利比里亚返回美国。利比里亚是西非埃博拉疫情爆发的中心地区。

奥巴马总统表示，抗击埃博拉是一项事关国家安全的当务之急。他说：“真实情况是，我们有别的国家没有的特殊能力，由于我们及早动手构建这个平台，所以我们现在能够从其他国家调动资源，迅速有效地遏制这场疫情扩散。”

奥巴马总统还表示，针对来自几内亚、利比里亚和塞拉利昂旅客的新检测措施将在美国的五大主要机场实施。

海关官员将询问旅客在西非旅行的情况，并检测旅客的体温，观察他们是否有埃博拉症状。

任何具有发烧或者显示出其它症状的旅客将被移交医疗当局进行详细评估。

Australian Nurse Tested for Ebola

An Australian nurse is undergoing medical tests after showing possible signs of Ebola, as the international community continues efforts to limit the outbreak of the virus.

Queensland state chief health officer Jeanette Young says the 57-year-old woman developed a "low-grade fever" shortly after returning from Sierra Leone, where she was working with Ebola patients.

Test results are expected to be released Friday. Young stressed that even if the woman does have Ebola, there is no reason for the public to be concerned about an outbreak.

The development comes a day after the first Ebola patient diagnosed in the United States died in Dallas, Texas following ten days of treatment.

Thomas Eric Duncan arrived in Dallas last month (on September 20) from his native Liberia, the epicenter of the West African Ebola outbreak.

President Barack Obama says fighting Ebola is a national security priority. He said: "What's true is we have unique capabilities that nobody else has and as a consequence of us getting in early building that platform we're now able to leverage resources from other countries and move with speed and effectiveness to curb that epidemic"

The president also says new screening measures for travelers coming from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone will be put in place at five major U.S. airports.

Customs officials will quiz passengers about their travel in West Africa, take their temperatures, and observe them for other signs of Ebola.

Anyone with a fever or showing any other symptoms will be passed on to medical authorities for a detailed evaluation.
