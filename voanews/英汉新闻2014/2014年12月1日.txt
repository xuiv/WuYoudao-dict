**潘基文：艾滋病防治取得进展有待稳固**

联合国秘书长潘基文赞扬国际社会在防治艾滋病方面取得了进展，但警告这种进展还是不稳固的。

星期一是世界艾滋病日，潘基文强调指出解决很多人得不到医治这一问题的重要性，尤其是儿童和年轻女性得不到必需的医护。潘基文敦促世界领导人采取必要措施，争取达到在2030年根除艾滋病的目标。

目前世界上有3500万艾滋病毒感染者。联合国说，其中1900万人不知道自己感染了艾滋病毒。在世界艾滋病日，联合国呼吁普及艾滋病毒检查和抗逆转录病毒治疗。

70%以上的艾滋病感染者在撒哈拉以南非洲，但自2005年以来，该地区的新感染病例下降了三分之一。

与此同时，中东、北非、东欧和中亚地区的艾滋病感染者人数有所上升。

Ban: Progress in AIDS Fight, But Gains 'Fragile'

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is praising the progress the world has made in combating AIDS, but warns "the gains remain fragile."

In a statement for Monday's World AIDS Day, Mr. Ban highlighted the importance of addressing gaps in access to treatment, particularly for children and young women who are not getting necessary care. He urged world leaders to do what is necessary to reach the goal of eradicating AIDS by 2030.

Worldwide, 35 million people are living with HIV, the virus the causes AIDS. The U.N. says 19 million of them do not know they are infected, and used World AIDS Day to call for closing the gap in testing and the availability of antiretroviral therapies.

Sub-Saharan Africa still accounts for more than 70 percent of the HIV-infected population, but new infections there have declined by one-third since 2005.

Meanwhile, infections have been rising during that period in the Middle East and North Africa, as well as in Eastern Europe and Central Asia.


**摩尔多瓦亲欧党派在议会选举中领先**

摩尔多瓦议会选举计票结果显示，主张与欧洲加强关系的政党领先于主张与俄罗斯增进关系的政党。

星期一清晨，85%的选票已经清点完毕，亲欧洲各政党共赢得44%左右的选票。摩尔多瓦议会共有101个议席。

主张与俄罗斯增进关系的社会党得到21%的选票，在各党中居于领先地位，但作为整体，亲俄政党只获得39%的选票。

今年早些时候，摩尔多瓦与欧盟签署了一项具有历史意义的协议，俄罗斯对此表示强烈反对，俄罗斯军队驻扎在讲俄语的摩尔多瓦分离地区德涅斯特。

该协议规定，摩尔多瓦人前往西欧可免签证，可进入自由贸易区，并能获得数亿欧元资助。作为报复，俄罗斯禁止进口多种摩尔多瓦食品。
摩尔多瓦位于乌克兰和欧盟成员国罗马尼亚之间，是欧洲最小、最贫穷的国家之一。

Pro-Europe Parties Lead in Moldova Elections

Results from parliamentary elections in Moldova show parties that want to pursue closer ties to Europe leading those that want closer relations with Russia.

With 85 percent of the vote counted early Monday, a group of pro-Europe parties had about 44 percent of the vote for the 101-member parliament.

The Socialist Party, which wants Moldova to work more with Russia, led individual parties with 21 percent, but overall pro-Russian parties trailed with a total of 39 percent.

Moldova signed a historic agreement with the European Union earlier this year, despite bitter opposition from Russia, which has troops stationed in the Russian-speaking breakaway region of Transdniestr.

The accord gave people in Moldova visa-free travel to Western Europe, access to a free trade zone and hundreds of millions of euros in funding. Russia retaliated with an embargo on imports of many Moldovan foods.

Moldova, one of Europe's smallest and poorest countries, is wedged between Ukraine and EU member Romania.
