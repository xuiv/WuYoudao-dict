**Pakistan Army Launches Offensive Against Militants**

Pakistan's army says it has started a "comprehensive operation" against foreign and local militants in the northwestern tribal region bordering Afghanistan, a move that effectively ends the government's policy of negotiating with militants.

News of the operation follows last week's militant attack on an airport in Karachi that left nearly 40 people dead, including 10 assailants.

Militants from the central Asian state of Uzbekistan, along with the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for a raid.

The military has not released information on the scope of their new operation, in the tribal region, or what it will entail.

Earlier Sunday, the army said it carried out a series of pre-dawn attacks in North Waziristan in which 80 "terrorists, mostly Uzbek foreigners" were killed.

内坦尼亚胡总理说，他认为巴勒斯坦权力机构应为这些少年失踪负责。他表示，这些少年被一个恐怖组织劫持。
巴勒斯坦人说，这些少年是在以色列控制的地区失踪的。巴勒斯坦官员还说，他们在与以色列方协调，寻找这些失踪少年。

**Israel Arrests 80 Palestinians**

Israel's military says it has arrested 80 Palestinians in the West Bank, including members of the militant group Hamas, in an effort to locate three teenagers. Officials say the Israeli teens, including one who also holds a U.S. passport, are believed to have been kidnapped Thursday in the area.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he holds the Palestinian Authority responsible for the young men's disappearances. He says the teens were "kidnapped by a terror group."

The Palestinians say the teens disappeared in an area controlled by Israel. Palestinian officials also say they are working in coordination with Israel in the search for the missing teens.
