**奥巴马将绕过国会宣布移民改革政令**

美国总统奥巴马计划绕过国会，宣布有关移民改革的行政手段。

白宫说，奥巴马总统星期四将发表全国讲话，详细阐述移民改革计划。

预计该计划将包括保护多达500万非法移民免于遣返，他们还将获得工作许可证。

免于遣返的非法移民包括美国公民的父母和配偶。

白宫发言人欧内斯特说，奥巴马此举将加强美国边境安全，增强经济，并使数百万人不再躲藏并遵守法律。

一些共和党议员指责奥巴马越权行事。

欧内斯特说，从艾森豪威尔总统开始，两党的几乎每任总统都为应对移民问题而采用行政手段。

民主党控制的参议院表决通过了一项移民改革议案，但欧内斯特说，共和党控制的众议院在此后的一年多里始终未就移民改革议案进行表决。

很多共和党人说，奥巴马和民主党人要对违法者实行大赦，而这对那些努力通过合法途径移居美国的人们是不公平的。

共和党人还主张加强美墨边界的安全措施。

Obama to Bypass Congress on Immigration Reform

U.S. President Barack Obama plans to bypass Congress and announce executive action on immigration.

The White House says Mr. Obama will address the nation Thursday on what it says are the details of his plan to fix a broken system.

It is expected to include protection from deportation for as many as 5 million illegal immigrants, who will also be made eligible for work permits.

This would include parents and spouses of U.S. citizens.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the president's action will strengthen national security at U.S. borders, strengthen the economy, and let millions of people come out from hiding and comply with the law.

Some Republicans in Congress accuse the president of overstepping his authority.

The White House spokesman says nearly every president from both parties as far back as Dwight Eisenhower took executive action to tackle problems with immigration.

The Democratically-controlled Senate passed bipartisan immigration reform, but Earnest says the country has been waiting for more than a year for a bill to come up for a vote in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.

Many Republicans say Mr. Obama and the Democrats want to grant amnesty to lawbreakers - calling this unfair to those who have been trying to legally immigrate to the United States.

They also want tougher security along the U.S.-Mexican border.

Buffalo, New York hit by massive winter storm

Forecasters say up to one more meter of snow is expected to fall Thursday on Buffalo, New York, two days after the city was literally buried by a massive winter storm. The new snow will add to the 1.5 meters of snow that left residents trapped in their homes and motorists stranded in their vehicles along a long stretch of the New York State Thruway.

Forecasters say the eventual snowfall totals will be as much as the city usually gets during an entire winter.

Seven people have now been confirmed dead in connection with the storm, including a man found dead in his car buried under the snow. Four other people died of heart-related causes.

Governor Andrew Cuomo has declared a state of emergency in 10 counties in the western New York region. Mr. Cuomo told reporters Wednesday this could be a record-breaking snowfall "when all is said and done."
