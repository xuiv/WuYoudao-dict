Afghan President-Elect Holds First News Conference

Afghan president-elect Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai is to hold his first news conference Monday, after being declared winner of the country's long-disputed presidential election.

Mr Ghani is to be sworn-in on September 29 at the Presidential Palace in Kabul.

His election rival, Abdullah Abdullah, becomes chief executive of the country under a power-sharing agreement the candidates signed Sunday.

The election commission will not officially release vote tallies from the audit of the run-off election held in June. This was one of Mr. Abdullah's final demands in negotiations with Mr. Ghani.

Leaked results, however, show Mr. Ghani took about 55 percent and Mr. Abdullah roughly 45 percent of the vote.


**13万叙利亚库尔德人逃往土耳其**

土耳其官员说，自上星期晚些时候以来，已经有超过13万叙利亚库尔德人越过边界进入土耳其，以躲避伊斯兰国激进分子的进攻。

土耳其副总理库尔图尔穆什星期一说，政府预计这个数字还将增加，并做好了应对“最坏情况”的准备。

自叙利亚2011年3月爆发内战以来，土耳其已经接收了大约85万叙利亚难民。其中30万左右是今年逃往土耳其的。

最新的难民潮是伊斯兰国激进组织上星期进入叙利亚北部库尔德人地区引起的。

伊斯兰国激进分子已经控制了叙利亚东部以及伊拉克北部和西部大片地区。最近他们扩大了在叙利亚城市拉卡据点以北的地区。

库尔德工人的呼吁武装土耳其库尔德人，保卫叙利亚边境城镇。

Turkey: 130,000 Syrian Kurds Have Crossed Border Fleeing Islamic State

Turkish officials say more than 130,000 Syrian Kurds have crossed into Turkey since late last week in order to flee an advance by Islamic State militants.

Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus said Monday the government is expecting the number to rise, and is prepared for "the worst case scenario."

Turkey has already taken in about 850,000 Syrian refugees since a civil war began there in March, 2011. Some 300,000 of them have arrived this year.

The latest influx has come as the Islamic State group pushed into Kurdish areas of northern Syria during the past week.

The expansion north of its stronghold in Raqqa, Syria, adds to the areas where the group has taken control in the eastern part of the country as well as large parts of northern and western Iraq.

The Kurdistan Workers Party has issued a call to arms for Turkish Kurds to defend Syria's border towns.
