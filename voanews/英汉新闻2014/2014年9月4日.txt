**美国司法部对弗格森镇警察展开调查**

美国司法部将针对密苏里州弗格森镇警察局展开广泛的民权调查，一名手无寸铁的黑人青年上月在弗格森镇被一名白人警察开枪打死。

据媒体报道，美国司法部最早将在星期四宣布进行调查的决定。这项调查将涉及有关弗格森镇警察经常侵犯该镇黑人居民权益的指称，并将调查弗格森镇警察的训练方式。

弗格森镇位于圣路易斯市郊区，大多数居民是黑人，但绝大多数警察是白人。《华盛顿邮报》上星期报道说，弗格森镇至少5名现役警察和1名退役警察被联邦检察机构指控过度使用武力。

美国司法部已对18岁的迈克尔.布朗被弗格森镇警察威尔逊开枪打死事件分别进行调查。

**Ferguson Police Under Federal Probe in Aftermath of Fatal Police Shooting**

The U.S. Justice Department will launch a broad civil rights investigation into the police department of Ferguson, Missouri, where an unarmed young black man was fatally shot by a white police officer last month.

News outlets say the Justice Department will announce the investigation as early as Thursday. The probe will look into allegations that Ferguson police have engaged in a repeated pattern of abusive treatment against the town's black residents, as well as how its officers are trained.

Ferguson, a suburb of St. Louis, has a majority black population, but its police force is predominantly white. The Washington Post reported last week at least five current Ferguson police officers and one former officer are facing federal lawsuits accusing them of excessive force.

The Justice Department is already conducting a separate civil rights investigation into the August 9 shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson.


**北约在威尔士举行峰会**

世界领导人星期四准备参加在威尔士举行的为期两天的北约峰会，预计此次会议将重点讨论乌克兰冲突以及叙利亚和伊拉克境内的伊斯兰极端分子威胁等问题。

预计北约将在威尔士城市纽波特商讨组建一支快速反应部队的事宜，这支部队应能迅速部署在乌克兰东部的热点地区。

乌克兰总统波罗申科将应邀作为非北约成员列席会议。有关官员说，波罗申科将在会议期间非正式会晤西方领导人。

俄罗斯指责北约有关组建快速反应部队的设想。俄罗斯一向强烈反对北约在其边境附近进行任何活动。本星期早些时候，俄罗斯表示，如果北约决定组建快速反应部队，俄罗斯就将重新审议其东欧战略。

在此次峰会期间，预计北约领导人将讨论应对伊斯兰国激进分子威胁的战略。伊斯兰国激进分子占领了伊拉克北部和叙利亚东部的大片地区。
美国对伊拉克境内的伊斯兰国激进分子进行空袭，同时其他北约成员国开始提供人道救援。

**Key NATO Summit to Open in Wales**

World leaders are gathering Thursday in Wales for the start of a two-day NATO summit expected to focus on the conflict in Ukraine and the threat of Islamic extremists in Syria and Iraq.

In the Welsh city of Newport, NATO is expected to debate formation of a rapid response military force capable of deploying on short notice to trouble spots in eastern Europe.

Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko is due to attend as a non-member invitee, and officials say he will meet with Western leaders on the sidelines of the gathering.

Russia, which has strongly opposed any NATO presence near its borders, has denounced the idea of a rapid response unit. Earlier this week, Russia said it will review its own military strategies in eastern Europe if NATO endorses creation of the force.

Also at the summit, NATO leaders are expected to discuss strategies for countering the threat from the Islamic State militant group that has overrun large parts of northern Iraq and eastern Syria.

The U.S. has been carrying out airstrikes against the group in Iraq, while other alliance members have begun providing humanitarian aid.
