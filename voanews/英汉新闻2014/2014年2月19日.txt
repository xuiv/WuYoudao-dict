**中国一名副省长接受腐败调查**

中国共产党宣布对退休高层领导人周永康的前秘书及助手冀文林展开腐败调查。有传言说，周永康本人也在接受调查。

中共反腐部门说，海南省副省长冀文林涉嫌严重违纪违法，不过没有透露其他有关细节。但这一指控几乎都是事关腐败。

冀文林的履历显示，他与周永康关系密切。周永康在上世纪90年代和本世纪初担任国土资源部部长和中共四川省委书记期间，冀文林曾任他的秘书和助手。

近几个月来，周永康的其他几名盟友受到调查，包括前公安部副部长李东生和前国务院国资委主任蒋洁敏。

有媒体暗示，中共甚至可能考虑对周永康提出贪腐指控。

Chinese Vice Governor Subject of Corruption Probe

China's Communist Party has announced a corruption probe into another ex-associate of retired senior politician Zhou Yongkang, who himself is the subject of a rumored investigation.

The party's internal graft body said Hainan vice governor Ji Wenlin is suspected of "severe violations of disciplines and laws." It gave no other details. But the charge almost always implies corruption.

Ji's resume suggests close links to the powerful Zhou. He served as his secretary and aide during Zhou's time as land resources minister and provincial head of Sichuan province in the 1990s and 2000s.

Other Zhou allies have been questioned for corruption in recent months, including ex-Vice Minister for Public Security Li Dongsheng and Jiang Jiemin, the head of a commission that regulates state-owned companies.

Several media reports have suggested that the party even may be considering corruption charges Zhou, who until late 2012 was one of the country's very top leaders.

**英高等法院支持扣留携机密文件的记者**

英国高等法院星期三裁决当局有权拘留携带机密文件的英国卫报记者格林·沃尔德的伴侣戴维·米兰达。米兰达去年在伦敦机场被扣留他但是携带美国国家安全局前合同工爱德华·斯诺登窃取的机密文件。

英国高等法院星期三说，对米兰达进行拘留问话不仅合法而且非常紧迫。

米兰达去年8月在伦敦希斯罗机场被拘留，当局查出他携带的电脑、手机和其他加密电子设备上存有近6万个机密文件。英国当局当时对他进行了近九个小时的审问。米兰达和沃尔德的律师称政府以反恐法律为依据羁押米兰达是非法的，侵犯了米兰达的言论自由权利。

美国国家情报局前合同工斯诺登曾把数千份机密文件交给英国卫报记者格林沃尔德，供其在给卫报撰稿时使用。 格林·沃尔德的支持者认为，英国的做法可能对其他记者的活动产生影响。卫报援引米兰达律师的话说，英国高等法院的裁决使记者无法对涉及国家安全问题的新闻进行负责任的调查性报道。

目前还不清楚戴维·米兰达是否会对星期三的裁决提出上诉。

British High Court Upholds Journalist's Detention

Britain's High Court has upheld the detention of a man stopped in London last year with classified documents leaked by former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.

The High Court said on Wednesday that the detention and questioning of David Miranda, partner of journalist Glenn Greenwald, was not only "legitimate, but very pressing."

Miranda was detained at Heathrow Airport last August, where his encrypted devices containing nearly 60,000 classified documents were seized. He was also questioned for nearly nine hours. Lawyers for Miranda and Greenwald had argued that the government's use of terrorism laws to justify its actions was improper and infringed on Miranda's right to freedom of expression.

Snowden passed thousands of classified documents to Greenwald to be used in articles for The Guardian newspaper. Supporters of Greenwald's case argue that Britain's actions have the potential to affect other journalist activities. The Guardian quoted Miranda's lawyer as saying the ruling "leaves little room for responsible investigative journalism which touches on national security issues."

It is not clear if Miranda can appeal Wednesday's ruling.
