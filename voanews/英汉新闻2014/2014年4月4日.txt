**开始水下搜寻马航失踪客机黑匣子**

有关人员开始在南印度洋海域搜寻马航失踪客机的飞行数据记录器。按照设计规定，黑匣子的电池将在几天内耗尽。

退役的前澳大利亚空军司令休斯顿星期五说，目前正在240公里宽的海域使用美国海军的脉冲信号定位仪探测失踪客机黑匣子发出的信号。

有关当局估计，黑匣子的电池大约将在下星期一耗尽，不再发出信号。

自这架原定从吉隆坡飞往北京的波音777客机失踪后，到下星期一已经过去30天，目前多国搜寻行动还没有找到有关这架客机的任何线索。

星期五，14架飞机和九艘船只继续在印度洋搜寻可能在海面漂浮的失踪客机残骸。

休斯顿是澳大利亚联合搜寻行动协调中心的负责人。他说，搜寻人员还没有放弃找到浮在水面上的失踪客机残骸碎片的希望。

Underwater Search for MH370 Black Box Begins

Crews in the remote southern Indian Ocean have begun the underwater hunt for the missing Malaysian jetliner's flight data recorder, which is set to run out of battery power in just a few days.

Retired Australian Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston said Friday a U.S. Navy towed pinger locator is being dragged across a 240-kilometer track to try to detect a signal from the black box.

Authorities estimate they have only until around Monday before the batteries run out on the black box's locator beacon, which transmits electronic signals, or pings.

That date marks 30 days since the Boeing 777 mysteriously vanished en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. A massive, multinational search effort has turned up no traces of the jet.

On Friday, an expanded team of 14 airplanes and nine ships continued their so far fruitless mission of looking for possible signs of wreckage floating on the ocean surface.

Houston, who is heading up the Australian agency coordinating the search, said crews have not given up hope of finding some debris floating on the water.

**乌克兰：亚努科维奇在俄罗斯帮助下命令枪杀抗议者 **

乌克兰官员谴责俄罗斯特工和亲俄罗斯的前乌克兰总统亚努科维奇要为今年早些时候反政府抗议活动进行到最高潮时发生的两天流血事件负责，流血事件造成1百多人丧生。有关当局说，很多丧生者是狙击手打死的。

今年2月基辅抗议者之死的迷局充满了阴谋论。俄罗斯总统普京认为，示威者自己就是枪击者，他们制造流血，以此让时任总统亚努科维奇的政府背黑锅。

乌克兰代理内务部长阿瓦科夫星期四把内务部按照亚努科维奇总统的命令行事的特警和至少17名抗议者的被杀联系在一起。他说，12名“金雕”特种警察的身份已经确认，当局已开始逮捕他们。

乌克兰国家安全局局长纳里瓦伊琴科称，有证据显示俄罗斯特工 “参与计划并实施了” 2月18日到20日在乌克兰首都造成人员伤亡的行动。

Ukraine: Protesters Shot Under Yanukovych's Orders with Russian Help

Ukrainian officials are blaming Russian agents and the country's ousted pro-Russian president for two days of bloodshed earlier this year at the height of anti-government protests that claimed more than 100 lives. Authorities say many of the dead were killed by sniper fire.

The mystery of the Kyiv protesters' deaths in February has fueled talk of conspiracies. Russian President Vladimir Putin has suggested the demonstrators themselves were the gunmen, acting to discredit the government of then-president Viktor Yanukovych.

On Thursday, acting Interior Minister Arsen Avakov linked special police from its Ministry of Internal Affairs, acting under orders of Mr. Yanukovych, to the killing of at least 17 protesters. He said 12 "Berkut" police have been identified and that authorities have begun arresting them.

For his part, Ukraine's security service chief ((Valentyn Nalyvaychenko)) said evidence shows Russian agents were involved in "the planning and implementation" of the deadly February 18-20.
