**半岛电视台三名记者将向埃及法院上诉**

一年前，三名半岛电视台记者在埃及被逮捕。他们被控支持被取缔的穆斯林兄弟会。星期四，这三名记者将向法院提出上诉。

澳大利亚公民格雷斯特和埃及裔加拿大公民法赫米被判7年监禁；他们的埃及同事默哈迈德被判10年监禁。

格雷斯特的兄弟迈克星期一对记者说，他的家人希望这次上诉能使格雷斯特获释。

Al-Jazeera Journalists Await Appeal After 1 Year in Egyptian Jail

Three Al-Jazeera journalists are marking one year since they were arrested in Egypt on charges of supporting the banned Muslim Brotherhood, as they look toward a court date Thursday to appeal their case.

Australian Peter Greste and Egyptian-Canadian Mohamed Fahmy are in prison on seven-year sentences, while their Egyptian colleague Baher Mohamed is serving a 10-year sentence.

Greste's brother Michael told reporters Monday that the family has to be hopeful the court appeal will lead to the journalists' release.

Egyptian President Mohamed Fattah el-Sissi said after the journalists were convicted in July that the decision must be respected and he would not interfere.

Al-Jazeera has insisted its workers were simply doing their jobs reporting the news, and the news agency called the verdict against them "shocking."

South Korea Proposes Talks With North Korea

A senior South Korean official has offered to hold ministerial-level talks with North Korea to discuss "mutual concerns," including a reunion of families separated by the Korean War.

Ryo Kihl-jae, the South's unification minister in charge of North Korean affairs, told a news conference Monday that a formal request had been sent to Pyongyang. He said he is willing to discuss any issues of mutual concern.

If agreed to, the talks would take place next month in Pyongyang with Ryo's counterpart, Kim Yang Gon.

The two countries had agreed on high-level talks scheduled for two months ago after a surprise visit to Seoul in October by a high-powered delegation from the North. However, North Korea angrily backed out when activists in the South sent anti-Pyongyang leaflets across the border via balloons.
