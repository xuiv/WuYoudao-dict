**尽管朝鲜反对，韩国表示军演照常**

韩国拒绝推迟与美国联合举行的军事演习，朝鲜本星期在一次高层会谈中提出这一要求。

美韩年度军演定于本月晚些时候举行，计划中的韩战离散家庭团聚也在同一时间。

韩国国防部发言人金珉奭说，朝鲜以军演为由威胁取消团聚计划，这种做法是不适当的。

韩国和朝鲜星期三举行了数年来最高层次的会谈。首尔表示，平壤要求把军演推迟两天。

几星期来，朝鲜一直要求取消美韩军演，后来又要求改变军演地点。朝鲜将美韩军演视为不可接受的入侵预演。

Despite NKorea Demands, Seoul Says War Drills Will Go On

South Korea is refusing to delay joint military drills with the United States, as requested by North Korea during high-level talks this week.

The annual war games are set to begin later this month, around the same time as planned reunions between families separated by the Korean War.

Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said the North's threat to call off the reunions because of the exercises was inappropriate.

The two sides Wednesday held their highest-level talks in seven years. Seoul says Pyongyang demanded a two-day delay in the drills. The

North has for weeks asked for a cancellation or, more recently, a relocation of the drills. It views them as an unacceptable rehearsal for invasion.

Massive Winter Storm Reaches Northeastern United States

More than 300,000 people across the southeastern United States are without power after deadly and unusual winter storm that coated the region with ice and snow Wednesday as it made its way to the mid-Atlantic and northeastern parts of the nation.

In the neighboring states of North and South Carolina, the storm made roads and major highways impassible, forcing many drivers to abandon their vehicles.

Forecasters said the Carolinas were expected to receive over 20 centimeters of ice and snow through Thursday morning.

Thousands of flights in and out of the region have been cancelled, stranding scores of passengers at airports.

The storm is expected to dump more than 30 centimeters of snow across the Washington, D.C. region Thursday. The federal government is closed, along with dozens of local government offices and school districts.

At least a dozens deaths in the southeastern U.S. have been blamed on the storm, including three people killed when an ambulance skidded off an icy road in Texas.
