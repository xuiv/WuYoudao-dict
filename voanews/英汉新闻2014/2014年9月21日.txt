**美国宇宙飞船前往国际空间站**

美国的SpaceX公司的商用货运飞船星期天从美国东南地区的佛罗里达州卡纳维拉尔角成功发射，飞船上载有国际空间站所需物资和实验设备。

运载飞船的猎鹰9型火箭预计星期二抵达国际空间站。

星期天的天气对发射非常理想。星期六的大雨迫使飞船的发射时间推迟。

2200多公斤的物资包括将第一次在空间站使用的三维打印机。

美国宇航局希望，宇航员未来可以用三维打印机制造所需零件。

这是SpaceX宇宙飞船的第五次航天飞行。

**SpaceX On Its Way to ISS**
A commercial SpaceX cargo ship has successfully launched from Cape Canaveral, in the southeastern U.S. state of Florida, carrying supplies and experiments for the International Space Station.
The ship, perched atop a Falcon Nine Rocket, took off at 1:52 a.m. (0552 UTC) and is expected to arrive at the ISS early Tuesday.

Sunday's weather was ideal for the launch, unlike Saturday when rain forced the launch to be postponed.

The more than 2,200 kilograms of supplies includes the first 3-D printer to be used on the space station.

The space agency envisions astronauts one day using the printer to manufacture spare parts as needed.

The mission is the fifth for SpaceX.

**白宫特工处加强白宫外围安全戒备**
美国特工处在一名男子星期五傍晚翻越白宫栅栏闯入白宫之后，加强了白宫外围的警戒。

特工处处长朱丽亚•皮尔森在事件发生后不久，命令提高白宫北面围墙的警员巡逻以及监控。她还命令全面审查这一事件。此前，一位42岁的携带一把刀子的男子翻过栅栏进入了白宫，随后被特工抓捕，引发特工处对白宫进行部分紧急疏散。

奥巴马总统和他的两个女儿此前刚刚乘直升机离开白宫。共和党籍众议员、众议院国家安全小组委员会主席詹森•查菲兹说，这一事件是“完全不可接受的”。

星期六，一名男子因私闯白宫被逮捕。特工处说，这位男子步行接近白宫大门被拦回。不久，他又开着车返回大门口。特工处在他拒绝离开后将他逮捕。

**Secret Service Under Scrutiny After Intruder Gets Into White House**

The U.S. Secret Service has increased security outside the White House after a man jumped the fence and made it inside the building before being apprehended.

Secret Service Director Julia Pierson ordered enhanced officer patrols and surveillance along the north fence of the White House shortly after the Friday incident. She also ordered a comprehensive review of what happened when an unarmed 42-year-old man scaled the fence and entered the presidential residence, where agents seized him.

President Barack Obama and his daughters had just left the White House Friday evening in a helicopter, when the unarmed intruder scaled the north fence, ran across the lawn and entered the presidential residence, where agents seized him.

Republican lawmaker Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House of Representatives' subcommittee on national security oversight, called the security breach "totally unacceptable."

A Secret Service official said the agency will review its response.

A day later, on Saturday, a man was arrested for trespassing at the White House. The Secret Service said the man approached the White House gates on foot and was turned away a short time before returning to the gate in a vehicle. He was arrested when he refused to leave.
