**China 'Strongly Dissatisfied' with US Comments on Tiananmen Square Anniversary**

China has responded angrily to comments by the United States on the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.

The White House said Wednesday it "will always speak out in support of the basic freedoms the protesters at Tiananmen Square sought."

It also called on Beijing "to account for those killed, detained or missing in connection with the events surrounding June 4, 1989."

China's Foreign Ministry said it is "strongly dissatisfied" with the statement, which showed what it called a "total disregard of facts."

Wednesday's anniversary of the Beijing massacre passed quietly in China, where public discussion of the incident is not allowed.
