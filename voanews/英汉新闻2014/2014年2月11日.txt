**首尔：朝韩将举行高级别会谈**

韩国表示，韩国周三将与朝鲜举行罕见的高级别会谈。与此同时，双方正在筹备朝鲜战争离散家庭团聚活动。

韩国统一部周二表示，没有为这次会谈设定正式议程。不过它说，将要讨论包括离散家庭团聚活动在内的一系列问题。

一名国家安全顾问将带领韩国代表团。目前不知道朝鲜将派出席会谈。会谈将在板门店边境村庄举行。

上星期，韩国和朝鲜同意恢复离散家庭团聚活动，上一次团聚活动是在2010年举行的。预定2月20日至25日将举行新的团聚活动。不过，人们担心朝鲜可能在最后一刻退出，就像它过去所做的那样。

平壤上周用已表示，它被迫重新考虑，这是在双方达成协议仅仅一天之后。朝鲜一直在敦促首尔和华盛顿取消定于二月下旬举行的年度联合军事演习。

North, South Korea to Hold High-Level Meeting: Seoul

South Korea says it will hold rare high-level talks with North Korea on Wednesday, as the two sides prepare for reunions between families separated by the Korean War.

Seoul's Unification Ministry said Tuesday no official agenda has been set for the meeting. But it said a range of issues, including the family reunions, would be discussed.

A deputy national security advisor is set to lead the South Korean delegation. It is not known who North Korea will send to the meeting, which will be held at the Panmunjom border village.

North and South Korea agreed last week to resume the reunions, which were last held in 2010. They are set for February 20-25, though there are concerns North Korea may pull out at the last minute, as it has done in the past.

Pyongyang already said last week it was forced to reconsider, just one day after reaching the deal. It has been pressuring Seoul and Washington to call off annual joint military drills that are scheduled to take place in late February.

**美大使将晤印度反对党领袖莫迪**

美国说，美国驻印度大使将会晤反对党领袖纳伦德拉.莫迪，他可能成为新德里的下一任总理。

计划中的会议已经由美国驻新德里大使馆证实。这意味着对这位印度教民族主义者的态度有所变化。

华盛顿一度对莫迪实行了签证禁令，那是在美国批评他2002年处理古吉拉特邦反穆斯林骚乱的方式之后。当时莫迪在那里担任首席部长。那次暴力事件造成超过1000人死亡。

美国大使馆一位发言人说，莫迪与美国大使南希.鲍威尔的会晤是“跟政界和商界资深领袖密集接触”的一部分，以突显美印关系。

最近的民意调查显示，如果莫迪的印度人民党（ BJP）在即将举行的议会选举中表现良好，他可能成为总理。

US Ambassador to Meet Indian Opposition Leader Modi

The United States says its ambassador to India will meet opposition leader Narendra Modi, who could become New Delhi's next prime minister.

The planned meeting, confirmed by the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi, represents a change of posture toward the Hindu nationalist.

Washington imposed a visa ban on Modi following criticism of his handling of anti-Muslim riots in 2002 in Gujarat state, where he is chief minister. The violence left more than 1,000 people dead.

A U.S. embassy spokesman said Modi's meeting with Ambassador Nancy Powell is part of a "concentrated outreach to senior political and business leaders" to highlight the U.S.-India relationship.

Modi could become prime minister if his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) performs well in the upcoming parliamentary elections, as recent polls suggest.
