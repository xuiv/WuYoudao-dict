**美国警察枪杀黑人青年事件继续引发骚乱**

在美国密苏里州城市圣路易斯郊区，一名没有武器的黑人青年被一名警察开枪打死后，当地警察与居民之间的紧张关系正在加剧。

星期三晚间，佩戴防暴护具的警察向数百名居民发射催泪弹和烟幕弹。在以黑人为主的弗格森社区，居民们连续第4个晚上举行抗议活动。

18岁的迈克尔•布朗上星期六被打死后，有2万1千人口的弗格森社区一直处于紧张状态。当地警方官员说，布朗是在警察车内扭打后被开枪打死的。但目击者说，警察在布朗和朋友走出商店双手高举表示投降时,向他连开数枪。

抗议演变为暴力，一些抗议者进行破坏并抢掠商店。警方在整个社区部署了乘坐军用车辆全副武装的警察。这一事态使当地居民与主要由白人组成的市政领导之间的关系更趋恶化


More Unrest in Wake of Police Shooting of Unarmed Black Teenager

Tensions are rising between police and residents in a suburb of St. Louis, Missouri, where an unarmed black teenager was shot and killed by a police officer.

Police in riot gear fired tear gas and smoke bombs late Wednesday night at hundreds of residents who were protesting for a fourth consecutive night in the predominantly-black community Ferguson.

The community of 21,000 residents has been on edge since the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown last Saturday. Ferguson police officials say Brown was killed after fighting with the policeman in his car. But witnesses say the teenager was shot multiple times as he and a friend were walking from a store, and that his hands were raised to show he was surrendering.

The demonstrations have turned violent, with some protesters vandalizing and looting stores. Police officials have responded by deploying heavily-armed officers in military-style vehicles throughout the community, a sight that has worsened relations between residents and Ferguson's mostly white political leadership.

在北京与其邻国在东中国海及南中国海的领土争端问题上，美中两国存在分歧。

在缅甸举行的东盟峰会上，中国拒绝接受美国提出的有关缓解领土争端紧张局势的建议。克里也出席了此次会议。

Kerry: US Committed to Asia Pivot

Secretary of State John Kerry says the United States is committed to pushing ahead with its new focus on Asia.

Kerry's comments came during a speech Wednesday at the East-West Center in Hawaii, a stop that concluded his eight-day tour of the Pacific.

The top U.S. diplomat said President Barack Obama has asked him to "redouble" his diplomatic efforts in the region.

Kerry said a key to those efforts is expanding cooperation with China, which has expressed concern at the so-called Asia "pivot."

One area of disagreement between China and the U.S. is Beijing's territorial disputes with its neighbors in the East and South China Seas.

During a meeting of Southeast Asian leaders in Myanmar, where Kerry was also present, China rejected a U.S. proposal to reduce tensions related to the disputes.

Kerry on Wednesday reiterated the U.S. takes no position on the disputes, but he said Washington does care about how they are resolved.
