**联大决议促缅甸平等对待罗兴亚少数族裔**

联合国大会星期一一致通过决议，敦促缅甸给予陷入困境的罗兴亚少数族裔公民权和平等权利。

决议对缅甸虐待大多是穆斯林的罗兴亚少数族裔深表关切。

大约14万罗兴亚人目前被困在缅甸若开邦拥挤肮脏的难民营里。2012年6月以来，那里的教派骚乱已导致280人死亡。

缅甸不承认罗兴亚族的存在。很多当地居民和政府官员称他们是来自孟加拉国的非法移民。

联合国决议敦促缅甸准许罗兴亚人拥有完整的公民身份，准许其自我认定为罗兴亚人而不是缅甸政府所说的孟加拉人。

联合国决议还要求缅甸向罗兴亚人提供“平等机会”服务，准许他们在政府的保护下返回自己的社区。

UN Urges Myanmar to Give Rohingya 'Full Citizenship'

The United Nations General Assembly has passed a resolution urging Myanmar to grant citizenship and equal rights to the country's beleaguered Rohingya minority.

In a resolution passed by consensus on Monday, the General Assembly expressed "serious concern" at Myanmar's treatment of the mostly Muslim minority group.

Around 140,000 Rohingya are stuck in filthy, overcrowded camps in Rakhine state, where sectarian unrest has left up to 280 people dead in since June, 2012.

Myanmar, also known as Burma, does not recognize the existence of the Rohingya ethnicity. Many locals and government officials instead say they are illegal migrants from Bangladesh.

The U.N. resolution urged members of the group to be granted "full citizenship" and be allowed to self-identify as Rohingya and not Bengali, as the government insists.

It also called on Myanmar to provide Rohingya with "equal access" to services and to allow the group to return to their communities with the protection of the government.


**普京的政敌被判刑 反对派呼吁上街抗议**

一家俄罗斯法院判定政治活动人士阿利克塞•纳瓦尔尼诈骗一家法国公司至少50万美元。

法庭判处这名现年38岁的律师和博客作者3年半监禁，缓期执行，大大低于检察官所要求的10年监禁。纳瓦尔尼的兄弟奥列格也被判定罪名成立，并被判处同样的刑期，但法庭命令他入狱服刑。

美国之音记者施锐福说，当局决定把奥列格投入监狱是一个明显的策略，目的是压制纳瓦尔尼的政治活动。

法庭把原定明年1月15日俄宣判提前到星期一，而且没有解释其中原因。一个脸书网页曾号召1月15日在克里姆林宫附近举行抗议活动，得到数万支持者的响应。

纳瓦尔尼在宣判后走出法院，敦促支持者继续抗议。他说，折磨无辜者的政权不应该存在，应该被摧毁。他呼吁支持者上街抗议，直到推翻这个政权为止。

自2月以来，纳瓦尔尼因参加一次未经批准的抗议活动而遭到软禁。

Putin Foe Convicted of Embezzlement, Sentence Suspended

A Russian court has found political activist Alexei Navalny guilty of defrauding a French cosmetics company at least $500,000.

The court sentenced the 38-year-old lawyer and blogger to a three-and-a-half year suspended prison sentence in the case, far lower than the 10 years sought by prosecutors. Navalny's brother Oleg was also convicted and received the same sentence, but was ordered to jail.

VOA's Daniel Schearf says the decision to send Oleg Navalny to jail is an apparent tactic to stifle Alexei Navalny's activism.

The court was originally supposed to deliver the verdict on January 15, but moved up the date on Monday with no explanation of its decision. A Facebook page created to organize a protest near the Kremlin on that day had attracted tens of thousands of supporters.

Navalny emerged from the courthouse after the verdict was announced to urge his supporters to continue their protests. He said, “this power does not deserve to exist, it should be destroyed. I am calling today on everybody to take to the streets, I'm calling to take to the streets until the power which tortures innocent people is removed."

Navalny has been under house arrest since February for participating in an unauthorized protest.
