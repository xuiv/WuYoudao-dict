**香港警方逮捕民主派活动人士**

香港警方表示，在反对北京决定甄选2017年香港特首候选人的抗议活动中，有19人被逮捕。

这些抗议者是星期一晚间被警方逮捕的，理由是他们在一名中国高官下榻的酒店外进行非法集会和妨碍警务。据报道，发生了小规模冲突，但无人受伤。

当地媒体说，在另一场示威中，警方以行为不端为由逮捕了3人，警察用辣椒水驱散了示威人群。中国人大常委会副秘书长李飞试图解释北京立场时，他的讲话被活动人士打断。打断李飞讲话的包括民主派立法会议员梁国雄。

香港学联副秘书长岑敖晖说, 质问李飞的目的主要是为了表达香港人民的屈辱和怨愤。

在警察迫使抗议者离开立法会后，李飞继续他的讲话。他说，作出这项决定是为了维护法治，保障香港的长期稳定。

中国的全国人大常委会星期日决定，香港的下一届特首候选人必须得到有着“广泛代表性”的提名委员会过半数的支持。反对派人士说，该委员会成员将多是亲北京人士。

全国人大常委会的这项规定使得任何反对派候选人都不可能成为2017年香港特首选举的候选人。

Hong Kong Arrests Pro-Democracy Activists

Hong Kong police say they have arrested 19 people during protests against Beijing's decision to censor candidates for the territory's 2017 election.

The protesters were arrested late Monday for illegal assembly and obstructing police outside the hotel where a senior Chinese official was staying. Minor clashes, though no injuries, were reported.

Local media said three others were arrested for disorderly conduct at a separate demonstration, which police dispersed using pepper spray. The activists disrupted a speech by Li Fei, deputy director of China's National People's Congress Standing Committee, who was trying to explain Beijing's stance.

Pro-democracy activist Leung Kwok-hung was among those who shouted down Li.

Lester Shum, deputy secretary-general of the Hong Kong Federation of Students, says he thinks the heckling of Li was intended mainly to express the humiliation and resentment of Hong Kong's people.

Li continued his speech after police forced the protesters out of the venue, saying the decision was made to protect the rule of law and safeguard Hong Kong's long-term stability

China's powerful Standing Committee ruled Sunday that candidates to become Hong Kong's next leader must receive a majority vote from a "broadly representative" nominating committee that opponents say will be stacked with pro-Beijing members.

That ruling makes it unlikely that any opposition candidates will get on the ballot for the 2017 election.


**巴基斯坦议会召开紧急会议**

两个多星期以来，成千上万抗议者占领了巴基斯坦首都市中心的一个地区，要求据称有选举舞弊行为的谢里夫总理辞职。

到上周末为止，抗议活动基本是和平的。抗议者和安全部队上周末发生冲突。

星期一，抗议者和警察之间爆发了更激烈的冲突。

示威者短暂占领了巴基斯坦国家电视台大楼，电视节目被迫中断。

Pakistani parliament holds emergency meetings

Pakistan's parliament is holding an emergency meeting Tuesday as part of efforts to rally political support for Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who is refusing to resign despite weeks of opposition protests.

Thousands of protesters have occupied a central part of the Pakistani capital for more than two weeks, demanding that the prime minister resign over alleged election fraud.

The protests have been mainly peaceful until this weekend when clashes erupted between protesters and security forces.

Monday witnessed more pitched battles between protesters and police.

Demonstrators briefly took over Pakistan's state television station, forcing the channel off the air.
