3 Killed as Thai Police, Protesters Battle in Bangkok

Thai anti-government protesters battled Tuesday with riot police trying to clear protest sites in Bangkok, leaving at least three people dead.

Officials say two protesters and one police officer were killed in the fighting near the Government House. Around 60 people were wounded.

Tear gas, gunfire and explosions could be heard during the midday fight. Both sides appeared to be using weapons.

The violence came as police attempted to clear several camps of protesters trying to oust Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra.

Elsewhere, protesters gave up without resistance. At the Energy Ministry, about 100 people were detained following a police operation.

Police say the protesters are violating a state of emergency, but have vowed not to use violence in dispersing the protests.

Hours after the clashes, Ms. Yingluck suffered a setback when the National Anti-Corruption Committee announced charges against her.

The committee said the prime minister was aware of corruption within a national rice-buying scheme, but continued the program anyway. It ordered her to face the charges on February 27.

**澳大利亚寻求避难者拘留中心发生致命骚乱**

澳大利亚官员说，位于巴布亚-新几内亚的拘留中心本星期发生第二次骚乱，一名寻求避难者被打死，至少77人受伤。

这一事件凸显了活动人士指出的问题，即位于偏远的马努斯岛上的拘留中心不安全，试图到澳大利亚寻求避难的人被送往该岛履行手续。

澳大利亚移民事务部长莫里森说，寻求避难者被告知他们将被重新安置在贫穷的巴布亚-新几内亚，随后爆发骚乱。

莫里森说，这次事件是一个“巨大的悲剧”，但他同时指责寻求避难者试图逃出拘留中心。

一些人权组织不同意莫里森的说法。难民行动委员会说，当地村民手拿砍刀、水管、棍棒和石块袭击寻求避难者。

负责担任拘留中心警卫工作的英国安全承包商G4S不接受这一指责，声称寻求避难者并非因为受到当地村民袭击而离开拘留中心。

Deadly Riots at Australian Detention Center in PNG

Australian officials say one asylum seeker was killed and at least 77 wounded during the second riot this week at a detention center in Papua New Guinea.

The case highlights what some activists say are unsafe conditions at the remote camp on Manus Island, where asylum seekers trying to reach Australia are sent for processing.

Australian Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said the unrest began after the would-be refugees were told they would have to be resettled in impoverished Papua New Guinea.

He called the incident a "great tragedy," but blamed the asylum seekers for allegedly trying to escape the facility.

Some rights groups disagree with that narrative. The Refugee Action Committee says local villagers armed with machetes, pipes, sticks and stones stormed the facility and attacked the asylum seekers.

British security contractor G4S, which guards the facility, denied those accusations, saying the asylum seekers did not leave the facility because of attacks by locals.
