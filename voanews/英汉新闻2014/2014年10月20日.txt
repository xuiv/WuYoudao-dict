**日本经产相和法务相辞职**

日本安倍内阁五名女性大臣当中的两位已经辞职。

她们都是星期一因为被指责滥用政治献金收买选票支持而辞职的。

上周有人指责前首相小渊惠三的女儿、经产相小渊优子花费数十万美元的竞选资金为她所在选区的选民购买戏院门票和其它礼物进行补贴。

在小渊经产相辞职几个小时之后，法务相松岛绿也提交辞呈。针对她的指称说，她向自己所在选区的选民散发印有她的名字和图片的纸扇子，违反了选举法。她说，这些扇子不应当被允许当作宣传单散发。

安倍首相星期一表示，“是我任命的她们，作为首相，我承担责任。”他向日本民众道歉，并表示他将在星期一指定两位辞职大臣的替代人选。

两名内阁成员一天内相继辞职，是安倍晋三2012年选举中大获全胜上台执政以来首次遇到的重大问题。安倍之前的多年间，日本政府非常脆弱，首相几乎一年一换。

政治资金丑闻问题在日本政坛多年存在，但是相比安倍之前的日本政府的记录来看，此次丑闻中礼物的类型和金额相对较小。

Japanese Trade, Justice Ministers Resign

Two of the five female ministers in Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's Cabinet have resigned.

Both resigned Monday over claims they misused political funds to buy voter support.

Allegations against Trade Minister Yuko Obuchi - daughter of a former prime minister - began to emerge last week that she spent hundreds of thousands of dollars of election funds to subsidize the purchase of theater tickets and other gifts for her home constituency.

Just hours after Obuchi resigned, Justice Minister Midori Matsushima handed in her resignation over claims that she had violated election law by distributing paper fans with her name and picture on them to voters in her district. She said the fans should be allowed as "leaflets."

Prime Minister Abe said Monday, "I appointed them and as prime minister, I bear responsibility." He apologized to the Japanese people and said he would appoint their replacement by the end of the day.

The double resignations are the first significant problem for Mr. Abe since he swept to power in 2012, ending years of fragile governments that swapped out prime ministers on an annual basis.

Political funding scandals are a chronic problem in Japan. However, the types of gifts and sums of money at the center of the latest allegations are relatively trivial compared with the record of previous governments.


**国际特赦：韩国虐待外来农业务工者**

国际特赦表示，韩国农业存在“普遍虐待”现象。国际特赦呼吁韩国停止大范围使用强迫外来劳工从事农业工作。

该组织发布的报告 - 《痛苦的收获》- 记录了韩国发生的普遍压榨外来农业劳工的情况。

报告说，韩国的雇佣许可制度目的是让雇用本国劳工有困难的中小企业能够雇用外国劳工。

国际特赦移民劳工权益研究员穆伊科表示，韩国有关当局制造了“一个令人羞耻的制度，让贩卖劳工和压榨外来劳工得以发展起来。” 穆伊科说：“雇佣许可制度是韩国的污点。”

这份报告是根据对韩国各地从事农业工作的外来移民劳工的采访撰写的。报告记录各种压榨外国劳工的现象，包括威胁、暴力、居住环境恶劣、加班加点、没有休息日和加班不加薪等。

Amnesty International: South Korea Abuses Migrant Agricultural Workers

Amnesty International says South Korea's farming industry is "rife with abuse," and has called on the country to end its widespread use of forced labor migrant agricultural workers.

A published report by AI (Bitter Harvest) documents the widespread exploitation of migrant agricultural workers in South Korea.

The report says the country's Employment Permit System, or EPS, is designed" to provide migrant labor to small and medium-sized enterprises that struggle to hire a sufficient number of national workers."

Amnesty International's migrant rights researcher, Norma Kang Muico, says South Korean authorities have created "a shameful system that allows trafficking for exploitation and forced labor to flourish." Muico says EPS is "a stain on the country."

The report, based on interviews with migrant agricultural workers across South Korea, documents a range of exploitation, including intimidation and violence, squalid accommodations, excessive working hours, no weekly rest days and unpaid overtime.
