Hagel to China: US Committed to Defense of its Asia Allies

U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is warning that the U.S. will defend its Asian allies in the event of any conflict with China.

The Pentagon chief made his comments Tuesday after meeting in Beijing with his Chinese counterpart Chang Wanquan.

Hagel said Washington is "fully committed" to treaties obliging it to protect its longtime allies Japan and the Philippines.

Manila and Tokyo are among several Asian countries that accuse China of using intimidation to advance its maritime claims.

Hagel also renewed U.S. criticism of the air defense identification zone set up by China last year that covers islands also claimed by Tokyo.

**俄外长：乌东南地区应纳入乌克兰前途会谈**

俄罗斯外长拉夫罗夫说，有关乌克兰未来的会谈应当包括乌克兰东南部地区。

拉夫罗夫星期二在莫斯科对记者说，俄罗斯希望看到这些地区在多边会谈中能有代表。这些地区多数人口说俄语。

在巴黎，北约秘书长拉斯穆森警告说，俄罗斯对乌克兰的进一步干预将是“历史性错误”，将使俄罗斯进一步孤立于世界。

另外也在星期二，俄罗斯外交部呼吁乌克兰停止俄方所说的在东南部地区采取有可能导致内战的军事准备活动。

乌克兰内务部长阿瓦科夫说，当局在驱逐占领哈尔科夫市一座政府建筑的亲俄示威者的反恐行动中，逮捕了70名抗议者。

亲俄示威者星期日占领了乌克兰城市哈尔科夫、顿涅茨克和卢甘斯克的建筑，要求就脱离乌克兰举行公投，类似于上个月的克什米尔公投。

Lavrov Wants Southeastern Regions Included in Ukraine Talks

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov says the southeastern parts of Ukraine should be included in talks about the country's future.

He told reporters Tuesday in Moscow that Russia wants to see those regions, which are largely Russian-speaking, represented in multilateral talks.

In Paris, NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen warned that further Russian intervention in Ukraine would be a "historic mistake" that would further isolate Russia from the world.

Also Tuesday, Russia's foreign ministry called on Ukraine to halt what it called military preparations in the southeast that could lead to civil war.

Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said 70 protesters were arrested in an anti-terror operation to drive out pro-Russian demonstrators who seized a government building in the city of Kharkiv.

Pro-Russian demonstrators took over buildings Sunday in the Ukrainian cities of Kharkiv, Donetsk, and Luhansk. They are demanding referendums on splitting with Ukraine -- the same kind of vote that took place last month in Crimea.
