**白宫敦促北京说明六四死难者、被拘留者和失踪者的情况**

星期三是中国当局暴力镇压学生主导的示威抗议25周年，天安门广场布满了警察。
身穿制服的警察和便衣警察加强戒备，检查路人的身份证，并禁止记者在天安门广场进行报道。

中国当局从未对发生于1989年6月3日和4日的事件做出全面说明，当时军人杀害了数百名，如果不是数千名，手无寸铁的抗议者。

北京不允许对这场屠杀进行任何公开讨论，并竭力消除全国民众对六四事件的记忆。
白宫星期三敦促中国当局对六四镇压中那些被打死的人、被拘留者以及失踪者的情况做出说明。

白宫的声明说，美国“将永远明确支持抗议者们在天安门广场追求的基本自由”。
华盛顿还要求北京释放在六四周年前夕拘留或软禁的数十名活动人士。

中国外交部发言人洪磊为拘留行动进行辩护，声称中国只惩罚违法者，而不惩罚异议人士。

White House urged China to account for those killed, detained, or missing in connection with Tiananmen crackdown

Police filled Beijing's Tiananmen Square on Wednesday, the 25th anniversary of the deadly crackdown of student-led demonstrations there.

Watchful Chinese security forces, both uniformed and plain-clothed, checked identifications of passersby and kept journalists from reporting in the square.

China has never given a full account of the June 3-4, 1989 incident, when soldiers killed hundreds, if not thousands, of unarmed protesters.

Beijing allows no public discussion on the massacre and has gone to impressive lengths to erase the nation's collective memory of the incident.

The White House on Wednesday urged China to account for those killed, detained, or missing in connection with the crackdown.

The statement said the United States "will always speak out in support of the basic freedoms the protesters at Tiananmen Square sought."

Washington has also demanded Beijing free the dozens of government critics detained or placed under house arrest ahead of the anniversary.

A spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry defended the detentions Tuesday, saying China was only punishing "law breakers" and not "dissidents."

**民调：乌克兰人反对外国干预**

一次新民调显示，绝大多数乌克兰人认为外国无权参与有关乌克兰前途的决定。

美国的盖洛普民调报告说，今年4月对1400名乌克兰人进行了采访，78%的受访者反对外国干预。受访者不包括克里米亚居民。

美国政府属下负责运营美国之音的广播理事会资助了这次独立的民调。

这次民调结果显示，乌克兰民意存在巨大分歧，而界定分歧基本是是按照地域和族裔，即乌克兰族和俄罗斯族。

民调显示，二十八个成员国的欧盟和美国在乌克兰西部居民中拥有更广泛的支持，而东乌克兰居民对西方的认同感较弱，当地的亲俄罗斯分离分子与乌克兰安全部队进行武装冲突。

在西乌克兰，84%以上的受访者主张乌克兰加入欧盟，而在东乌克兰，只有19%的受访者赞成加入欧盟。在乌克兰全境，大多数乌克兰族人支持加入欧盟，而俄罗斯族人中主张加入欧盟的只有20%。大多数乌克兰人反对加入北约。

Poll: Ukrainians Want Freedom from Outside Intervention

A new poll shows that the vast majority of Ukrainians feel that no outside country has a right to be involved in decisions about their country's future.

The U.S.-based Gallup poll said its April survey of 1,400 Ukrainians outside of the Crimean peninsula annexed the month before by Russia showed 78 percent opposed to outside interference.

The independent poll was funded by the U.S. government's Broadcasting Board of Governors, which operates Voice of America.

The survey depicted a wide divergence of opinion in Ukraine, largely defined by geography, as well as Ukrainian and Russian ethnicity.

The poll showed broader support for the 28-nation European Union and the United States in western Ukraine, with diminishing identity with the West in the eastern reaches of the country, where pro-Russian separatists have engaged in armed clashes with Kyiv's security forces.

More than 84 percent of those polled in western Ukraine said the country should join the EU, but only 19 percent in eastern Ukraine want EU membership. Across Ukraine, a majority of ethnic Ukrainians support EU membership, but only one in five ethnic Russians do, and a plurality of Ukrainians oppose membership in the NATO alliance.
