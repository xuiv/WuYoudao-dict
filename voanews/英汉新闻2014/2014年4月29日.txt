**奥巴马结束亚洲四国行 隐含批评中国**

美国总统奥巴马星期二结束为期一周的亚洲四国之行时，再次隐含地批评中国的外交政策。

奥巴马总统在离开马尼拉之前对美国和菲律宾军人发表讲话，重申美国政府长期以来在中国海事争端问题上的立场。

奥巴马说：“我们认为，必须遵守国际法，必须维护航行自由，绝不能妨害商业运作。我们认为，必须以和平方式解决争端，而不能诉诸恐吓与武力。”

奥巴马在讲话中没有点中国的名。一天前，华盛顿和马尼拉签署了一项新防务协定，以扩大美国在菲律宾的军事存在。

奥巴马强调，美国对保护菲律宾有着不可推卸的责任。他提到1951年的一项协定，美国和菲律宾在该协定中同意在受到攻击时相互保护。

As Obama Leaves Asia, One Last Swipe at China

U.S. President Barack Obama took another implicit swipe at China's foreign policy Tuesday as he wrapped up a week-long, four-nation tour of Asia.

Speaking to U.S. and Philippine troops before departing Manila, President Obama repeated his administration's long-held stances on China's maritime disputes.

Obama said：" We believe that international law must be held, that freedom of navigation must be preserved, and commerce must not be impeded. We believe that disputes must be resolved peacefully and not by intimidation or force."

The comments, which did not mention China by name, come a day after Washington and Manila signed a new defense deal to expand the U.S. military presence in the Pacific nation.

Mr. Obama stressed that the U.S. commitment to defend the Philippines is "iron-clad." He cited a 1951 treaty in which both nations agreed to protect one another if attacked.
