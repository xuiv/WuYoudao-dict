奥巴马抵达日本开始亚洲之行
美国总统奥巴马抵达日本，开始亚洲四国之行。在访问期间，奥巴马将争取让盟国相信华盛顿致力于推行亚太再平衡战略。

中国领土要求引发的安全担忧以及朝鲜核项目将是奥巴马此次亚洲之行的重点。奥巴马将访问日本、韩国、马来西亚和菲律宾。

奥巴马的八天行程从星期三晚间抵达东京开始，他将在东京会见日本首相安倍晋三。日本与中国围绕东海一组无人岛屿的主权争议不断升级。

奥巴马在启程之前对日本报纸《读卖新闻》说，美国反对任何国家单方面试图损害日本对有关岛屿的管理。他还强调，依照美日安保条约，如果有关岛屿受到攻击，美国有义务提供防御。

奥巴马在访问期间还将努力与日方一道推动拖延已久的跨太平洋战略经济伙伴关系协定。但很多人认为，由于日本不愿免除农产品关税，取得突破的可能性很小。

Obama Departs for 8 Day Tour of Asia

U.S. President Barack Obama has left for a four-nation tour of Asia, where he will try to convince allies that Washington is committed to its "rebalancing" in the Pacific.

Security concerns over China's territorial claims and North Korea's nuclear program will be a major focus of Mr. Obama's trip, which include stops in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and the Philippines.

The eight-day tour begins in Tokyo late Wednesday with a meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Japan is embroiled in a growing dispute with Beijing over a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea.

Ahead of his visit, Mr. Obama told Japan's Yomiuri newspaper the United States opposes "any unilateral attempts to undermine Japan's administration of these islands." He also stressed the islands fall under a treaty that requires the U.S. to defend Japan if attacked.

Mr. Obama will also try to make progress with Japan on the long-delayed Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade deal. But many say Japan's reluctance to drop tariffs on agricultural products makes chances of a breakthrough slim.

​乌克兰宣布正式取消复活节停火，再次对东部亲俄罗斯分子展开反恐行动。

乌克兰第一副总理亚勒玛在星期三的内阁会议上对记者说， 将采取“适当行动”，很快就能看到结果。

亚勒玛说，美国已向乌克兰保证不会让乌克兰单枪匹马地面对俄罗斯入侵。他表示希望美国的支持更有实质性。

美国国防部星期二宣布将派600名美国军人前往波兰和波罗的海国家，向莫斯科“发出信息”，让美国的盟友和伙伴安心。

乌克兰临时总统亚历山大·图奇诺夫已命令安全部队在东乌克兰恢复反恐行动。在他宣布这一决定几个小时之前，美国副总统拜登刚刚结束对基辅两天的访问。

拜登呼吁莫斯科信守承诺，停止支持乌克兰境内的亲俄武装分子。

乌克兰上星期出动军队，企图把占据政府建筑的分离主义分子赶出去，但没有成功。

上星期在日内瓦召开的国际会谈虽然达成协议，但协议并未得到落实。没有迹象显示亲俄罗斯分子做出让步。

Ukraine Formally Calls Off Easter Truce with Pro-Russian Separatists

Ukraine has formally called off the Easter truce against pro-Russian separatists in the east and says anti-terrorist operations are on again.

First Deputy Prime Minister Vitaliy Yarema told reporters during a Cabinet meeting Wednesday that what he calls "appropriate steps" will be taken and that results will be seen shortly.

Yarema said Ukraine has gotten assurances from the United States that it would not be left alone to face Russian aggression. He expressed hope that the U.S. support will be more substantive.

The Pentagon said Tuesday it is sending 600 U.S. troops to Poland and the Baltics to "send a message" to Moscow and to reassure American allies and partners.

Ukraine's interim President Oleksandr Turchynov has already ordered security forces to resume "anti-terror" operations in eastern Ukraine. His order came just hours after U.S. Vice President Joe Biden ended a two-day trip to Kiyv.

Biden called on Moscow to honor its promise to withdraw support for armed pro-Russian separatists inside Ukraine.

Ukrainian military moves last week to drive the separatists from government buildings they have seized in about a dozen cities failed.

An agreement signed in Geneva last week aimed at cooling tensions in Ukraine has gone nowhere and the pro-Russians are showing no signs of backing down.
