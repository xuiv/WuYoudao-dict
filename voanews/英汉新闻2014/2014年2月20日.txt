**美国警告航空公司注意可能藏在鞋中的炸弹**

美国政府向各航空公司发出警告说，飞往美国的国际航班面临潜在的鞋中炸弹威胁。

美国国土安全部星期三说，根据可靠的近期情报发出了上述警告。情报显示，袭击者企图利用藏在鞋中的爆炸物攻击客机。

三个月来，这是美国政府第二次警告可能存在针对商业航班的爆炸威胁。

美国情报消息人士说，国土安全部向各航空公司发出通知，重申要注意液体、鞋子和某些化妆品，而美国交通安全管理局的现行安全条例都列入了这些物品。

美国全国广播公司星期三首先报道了这项警告。目前还不清楚这一警告是否与早些时候飞往俄罗斯的航班受到的威胁有关。

本月早些时候，美国国土安全部警告说，飞往俄罗斯的航班要注意检查可能藏在牙膏筒里的爆炸装置。

US Warns Airlines of Possible Shoe Bomb Threat

The U.S. government has warned airlines about a potential shoe bomb threat on international flights to the United States.

The Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday it issued a warning based on "very recent intelligence" considered credible that assailants would try to attack passenger jets using explosives hidden in shoes.

It is the second time in three months that the government has issued a warning about possible attempts to smuggle explosives on a commercial jetliner.

U.S. intelligence sources said the DHS released a notice to airlines reiterating that liquids, shoes and certain cosmetics were of concern, all of which are covered under existing Transportation Security Administration security policies.

It is not clear if the latest warning, first reported Wednesday by NBC News, is related to earlier threats to Russia-bound flights.

Earlier this month, the DHS warned airlines with flights to Russia to be on the lookout for explosive devices possibly hidden inside toothpaste tubes.

**基辅星期四又爆发冲突 22人丧生**

乌克兰首都基辅的目击者说，反政府抗议者与警察重新爆发冲突，有至少22人丧生。在这之前几个小时，总统亚努科维奇刚刚与反对派领袖宣布暂停冲突。

据报道，死者中有些人是被政府的狙击手击毙的。乌克兰内务部报告说，星期四有三名警察丧生，50多名警察受伤后被送往医院，其中30人是枪伤。

最新的消息使死亡人数又有增加。之前，乌克兰卫生部表示，有28人在本星期的冲突中死亡。冲突是在防暴警察冲击基辅一处临时抗议营地后爆发的。

在冲突重起之际，欧盟三个成员国的外长在基辅会晤了总统亚努科维奇，讨论当前的危机。早些时候的报道曾说，由于重新爆发暴力，会谈已被取消。同天晚些时候，欧盟在布鲁塞尔召开紧急会议，讨论对制造动乱者可能实施的制裁措施。

反政府抗议者与警察的暴力在本星期升级。除了死者之外，还有将近300人被送进医院，包括88名警察、六名记者和一名议员。

亚努科维奇总统与反政府抗议活动领袖星期三达成了停止冲突的协议。亚努科维奇在他的网站上发表声明说，决定停止冲突是为了“社会安宁而结束流血和稳定局势”。声明没有说明细节。

Clashes Break Out in Kyiv Despite Truce

Witnesses in the Ukrainian capital say at least 22 people have been killed in fresh clashes that erupted between anti-government protesters and police, hours after President Viktor Yanukovych announced a truce with opposition leaders.

Some of those killed were reportedly shot by government snipers. Ukraine's Interior Ministry, meanwhile, reported that three police officers were killed Thursday. It said more than 50 police personnel had been hospitalized during the day, 30 of them with gunshot wounds.

The latest reported death toll is in addition to the 28 people the health ministry says were killed in clashes earlier this week after riot police swarmed a makeshift protest camp in Kyiv.

The violence comes as three European Union foreign ministers met with President Yanukovych in Kyiv to discuss the crisis. Earlier reports said the talks were called off due to the renewed violence. Later in the day, the EU is holding an emergency meeting in Brussels to discuss possible sanctions against those responsible for the unrest.

Clashes between anti-government protesters and police have escalated this week. In addition to the deaths, nearly 300 people have been hospitalized -- including 88 police officers, six journalists, and a member of parliament.

President Yanukovych and the leaders of anti-government protests had agreed on a truce Wednesday. A statement on President Viktor Yanukovych's website said it is aimed at "ending the bloodshed and stabilizing the situation ......in the interests of social peace." It did not provide details.
