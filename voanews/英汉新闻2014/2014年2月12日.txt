Russia Plans Veto of Security Council Resolution on Syria

A Russian official says a draft U.N. Security Council resolution on humanitarian aid for Syria has been crafted as a precursor for military intervention, and that Russia will not let it pass.

Russian media quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov saying Wednesday that the resolution is "unacceptable" in its current form. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has called the measure a one-sided effort to blame the Syrian government.

U.S. President Barack Obama said in a joint news conference Tuesday with French President Francois Hollande that aside from Russia, there is "great unanimity" among the council on the resolution to give greater access to aid workers.
