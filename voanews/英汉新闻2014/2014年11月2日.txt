** Protesters Call for Burkina Army to Hand Over Power**

Thousands of Burkina Faso residents took to the streets Sunday to call on the military to hand over power to civilian authorities following the resignation of the country's longtime president.

The brief rally, in the capital Ouagadougou, ended when opposition leaders headed into closed door talks with the country's military leaders.

Opposition leaders have said the transition of power should be "democratic and civilian" and not be taken over by the army.

President Blaise Compaore's 27 years in power ended on Friday after marchers stormed parliament following his push for a constitutional amendment that would have allowed him to run for another term.

After a brief power struggle, the military then named the second in command of the presidential guard, Yacouba Isaac Zida, to lead the country's transition.

The United Nations envoy for West Africa joined the United States and the African Union in calling on the military to immediately transfer power to civilian authorities in Burkina Faso.

** At Least 48 Dead in Pakistan Bombing**

Authorities in Pakistan say a bomb attack in the Lahore region has killed at least 48 people, and the death toll could rise.

The attack took place near the Wagah border crossing with India where a "lowering of the flags" ceremony is held every evening.

The ceremony starts just before sunset and hundreds of people, including foreign tourists, normally gather on both sides of the border to witness it.

The head of Pakistan's security forces on the eastern border, Major-General Khan Tahir Javed Khan, told reporters a suicide bomber caused the blast.

General Khan said the bomber apparently wanted to strike the ceremony but a security cordon stopped him about 500 meters away. The man detonated the explosives at a place where families had stopped to buy food after witnessing the ceremony.

The flag ceremony has been taking place since 1959 and Sunday's violence was the first near the event.

Wagah is the only road border crossing between Pakistan and India.

Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has condemned the attack. Authorities have started an investigation.

巴基斯坦警方说，星期天晚间拉合尔地区发生巨大爆炸，炸死至少48人。

爆炸发生在巴基斯坦与印度边境的哇嘎镇，受伤人员被送往拉合尔的几家医院。

爆炸发生前不久，边境城镇哇嘎刚刚结束了每天的降旗仪式。那里是巴基斯坦和印度之间唯一的道路边境点。

降旗仪式每天晚上日落前举行，包括外国游客在内的数百人在印度和巴基斯坦边境两边观看这个仪式。

巴基斯坦东部边界安全部队指挥官塔赫尔将军对记者说，一名自杀炸弹杀手引爆了炸弹。他说，凶手企图在降旗仪式上引爆炸弹，但保安人员在大约500米以外的地方拦住了他。 他于是在游客们观看降旗仪式后购买食物的地方引爆了炸弹。

升降旗仪式从1959年开始经常举行，星期天的爆炸是升旗地点附近首次发生暴力袭击。

巴基斯坦总理谢里夫谴责这次暴力袭击。当局已开始调查。
