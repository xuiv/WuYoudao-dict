Vatican Arrests Defrocked Archbishop for Child Abuse

The Vatican has put its former ambassador to the Dominican Republic under house arrest on charges of sexually abusing children.

Polish-born ex-Archbishop Jozef Wesolowski was defrocked in June after being found guilty of the charges. He now faces a separate criminal trial for child sex abuse for which he could face imprisonment.

Pope Francis has said no one in the church, from priests to high-ranking cardinals, has any privileges when it comes to allegations of sex abuse.


**中国国家发改委原副主任刘铁男出庭受审**

中国国家发改委原副主任刘铁男星期三因涉嫌受贿近600万美元而出庭受审。

刘铁男是中国共产党为清理党内腐败而展开的高调反腐运动中被拉下马的最新一名高级官员。

河北省廊坊市中级法院称，刘铁男收受了相当于580万美元的贿赂，其中部分为现金，其他包括一辆保时捷汽车和北京一所别墅。

刘铁男几乎肯定会被认定有罪，因为由共产党控制的中国法院在这类案子中从未作出过有利于被告的判决。

对刘铁男的指控最初是由财经杂志一名记者提出的。刘铁男后来被开除出党，接受调查。

China Tries Ex-Economic Official for Corruption

A former senior Chinese economic official stood trial Wednesday on charges of taking nearly $6 million in bribes.

Liu Tienan is the latest Chinese official to be brought down in a highly publicized campaign meant to weed out corruption in the Communist Party.

A court in the northern province of Hebei says Liu took $5.8 million in bribes. Some were in the form of cash. Others were gifts, including a Porsche and a Beijing villa.

He is almost certain to be found guilty, since Chinese courts are controlled by the Communist Party and virtually never rule in favor of the defendant in such cases.

The allegations against Liu were first made in 2012 by a journalist at the Caijing investigative magazine. Liu was later expelled from the Communist Party and placed under investigation.
