**回应弗格森事件，奥巴马希望更多警察经费**

美国总统奥巴马要求动用联邦拨款来加强全美各地警察装备，以此作为对一名没有携带武器的黑人青少年在与一名白人警察街头对抗中被开枪打死一案的回应。事件发生在密苏里州中部的弗格森镇。

奥巴马星期一在白宫会晤他的内阁成员、民权领袖和执法官员之后，宣布了向全美各地警察力量拨款２.6亿多美元的提案。他说，这笔款项将用于为警察配备5万部穿戴式摄像机，以纪录他们对民众执法时的情况，并用于提供更多的警察训练。

奥巴马还宣布，他将成立一个工作组，负责研究如何改进执法。奥巴马说，美国的有色人种感到他们没有受到警察的公平对待，这导致他所说的社区里“深层不信任”，并削弱了这个国家。

美国司法部长霍尔德在已故民权运动领袖马丁•路德•金曾领导过的一个具有历史意义的教会发表讲话，宣布了司法部的新计划，努力结束以种族为判断依据的做法，确保警察公平有效地执行公务。

Obama Wants More Police Funding After Ferguson Unrest

U.S. President Barack Obama is calling for millions of dollars more in federal spending to improve police forces around the country, in response to the shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a white policeman during a street confrontation in the central town of Ferguson, Missouri.

After meeting at the White House Monday with his Cabinet, civil rights leaders and law enforcement officials, Mr. Obama announced spending proposals of more than $260 million for police forces across the United States. He said the additional money would pay for 50,000 body cameras for police to wear to record their interactions with civilians, as well as to fund more training for police.

The president also announced he will set up a task force to study how to improve policing. He said Americans of color do not feel they are being treated fairly by police, creating what he called a "simmering distrust" in communities and weakening the country.

Speaking in Atlanta Monday at the historic church once led by the late Reverend Martin Luther King, Junior, Attorney General Eric Holder also announced new Justice Department plans aimed at ending racial profiling and ensuring fair and effective policing.


**黎巴嫩军方扣留伊斯兰国头目妻儿**

安全官员说，黎巴嫩军方扣押了伊斯兰国组织领导人阿布•贝克尔•巴格达迪的妻子和儿子，两人目前被关在黎巴嫩国防部，接受讯问。巴格达迪的妻子和儿子大约10天前在叙利亚边界附近被扣留。

黎巴嫩《亚斯萨菲尔报》报道，黎巴嫩军队 “与外国情报机构协调”开展了这个行动。

巴格达迪自2010年以来一直领导着伊斯兰国组织。他今年年初宣布在伊斯兰国激进分子占据了大块领土的叙利亚东部和伊拉克北部地区建立“哈里发国”。美国已宣布巴格达迪为全球恐怖分子，并悬赏1千万美元捉拿他。

另外，美国国务卿约翰•克里周三将出席在布鲁塞尔召开的部长级会议。60个联盟伙伴国家将在会议上讨论如何针对打击伊斯兰国组织做出政治努力。

Lebanon Detains Wife, Child of Islamic State Leader

Security officials say the Lebanese military has detained a wife and child of Islamic State group leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

The officials said Tuesday the woman and child were being held and questioned at Lebanon's defense ministry, after being detained about 10 days ago near the border with Syria.

Lebanon's As-Safir newspaper reported the military detained the two "in coordination with foreign intelligence agencies."

Baghdadi has led the Islamic State group since 2010, and earlier this year declared a "caliphate" over eastern Syria and northern Iraq where militants seized large pieces of territory. The United States has declared him a global terrorist and offered a bounty of up to $10 million.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is due to lead a ministerial-level meeting Wednesday in Brussels where 60 coalition partners will discuss political efforts to combat the Islamic State group.
