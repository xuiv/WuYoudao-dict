世界粮食计划署在进行了一个星期的大规模筹款之后，恢复向五个国家境内的叙利亚难民提供食品卷。

世界粮食计划署星期二说，一些国家的政府和个人捐献了8千万美元。

世界粮食计划署执行总干事埃塞林•库桑说，这笔捐款显示出“前所未有”的大力支持。

约旦、黎巴嫩、土耳其、伊拉克和埃及境内的叙利亚难民可以用食品券在当地商店购买食物。

WFP Resumes Food Aid to Syrian Refugees

The World Food Program has resumed its program providing food vouchers to Syrian refugees in five countries, following a week of massive fundraising.

The U.N. agency had stopped providing the vouchers last week, saying it needed $64 million to meet the needs of 1.7 million refugees in December.

The World Food Program said Tuesday that individuals and governments have since contributed $80 million.

WFP Executive Director Ertharin Cousin called the funding an "unprecedented" outpouring of support.

The food vouchers allow refugees to buy food from local vendors in Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq and Egypt.


**世界发达经济体贫富差距加大**

一份新的报告指出，一些世界大经济体的贫富差距已经达到30年来的最高水平。

总部设在巴黎的经济合作与发展组织周二表示，该组织34个成员国中，最富有的10%的人的年收入是最穷的10%的9.5倍。而在20世纪80年代，这个数字是7比1.

经合组织包括美国、日本和最大的欧洲经济体。该组织说，巨大的贫富差距对经济发展有“显著的负面影响和统计上的巨大影响”。

它表示，对经济发展影响最大的因素是“中产阶级下层和贫困家庭收入与社会其他阶层收入的差距扩大”。

Income Gap Widening in World's Developed Economies

A new report says the gap between the richest and poorest people in some of the world's biggest economies has reached its highest level in 30 years.

The Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said Tuesday the richest 10 percent in the 34 countries that belong to the group now annually earn nine and a half times that of the poorest 10 percent. By comparison, the ratio was seven to one in the 1980s.

The OECD, which includes the United States, Japan and the biggest European economies, said the large wealth inequality has a "negative and statistically significant impact" on economic growth.

It said the single biggest impact on growth is "the widening gap between the lower middle class and poor households compared to the rest of society."
