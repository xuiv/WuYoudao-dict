** US, Iran Negotiating, but Nuclear Pact Appears Unlikely Before Deadline **
VOA News

The top U.S. and Iranian diplomats are meeting in Vienna in a last-ditch effort to reach a comprehensive deal on Tehran's nuclear program, but an accord appears unlikely before Monday's deadline.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif started a fifth round of talks Sunday, with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov set to join them later Sunday.

The Iranian Students News Agency quoted an unidentified member of Iran's negotiating team as saying a new pact will not be possible with the short time left until the deadline and the number of issues yet to be resolved. Iran said it would start discussion of an extension to the talks if no agreement is reached by Sunday night.

Kerry said Saturday "serious gaps" remain in the talks. He recently said the United States and its P5 Plus 1 allies - Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia - are not considering an extension past Monday's target date.

German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the main question is if Iran is ready to end its research on acquiring a nuclear weapon.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu voiced new fears Sunday that the countries negotiating with Iran will leave it with the ability to create a nuclear weapon.

美国和伊朗最高级别的外交官星期天再次在维也纳举行会谈，设法在最后期限之前就伊朗核项目达成协议，但是要在星期一最后期限之前达成协议看来是不太可能了。

克里和伊朗外长扎里夫星期日开始举行第五轮会谈，俄罗斯外长拉夫罗夫稍后也会加入会谈。

伊朗学生通讯社援引未透露身份的伊朗谈判小组成员星期天在日内瓦的话报道说，最后期限之前时间不多了，但还有若干问题没有解决，双方不可能在最后期限之前达成协议。伊朗说，如果到星期天夜里仍然无法达成协议，他们愿意开始讨论延长谈判的问题。

美国国务卿克里说，伊朗与有关大国之间的谈判仍存在“重大分歧”。他最近说，美国和5+1盟友，英国，中国，法国德国和俄罗斯都不考虑延长星期一的最后期限。

德国外长施泰因迈尔说，主要问题是伊朗是否准备结束其为研制核武器而进行的研究。

以色列总理内塔尼亚胡星期天表示担心与伊朗谈判的大国会让伊朗有能力制造核武器。


** Afghanistan Approves Plan to Increase US, NATO Military Action **

VOA News

Afghanistan's lower house of parliament has approved agreements with the United States and NATO allowing international forces to remain in the country past the end of this year, amid a renewed offensive by Taliban militants.

Sunday's approval came after U.S. officials said President Barack Obama had issued new guidelines expanding the U.S. military's ability to respond to militants.

Speaking under condition of anonymity, officials told news outlets the decision allows U.S. troops to go after Taliban fighters if they pose a threat to U.S. and coalition forces. The order reportedly also applies if the militants provide direct support to al-Qaida.

The new authorization for 2015 also means the U.S. can offer air support to Afghan troops when needed.

President Obama had previously said U.S. missions in Afghanistan next year would be limited to training Afghan forces and counter-terrorism operations against al-Qaida.


**阿富汗议会准许国际部队年底后继续驻扎**

美国之音

阿富汗议会下院星期天在塔利班激进分子不断发动进攻之际批准与美国和北约的协议，允许国际部队今年年底以后继续驻扎在阿富汗境内。

在此之前，美国官员说，奥巴马总统发布了有关扩大美军对激进分子反应能力的新准则。这位不愿透露姓名的官员说，新准则准许美军在激进分子对美国和联军部队构成威胁时予以打击。

这也适用于向基地组织提供支持的激进分子。 2015年开始实施的新授权还意味着美国可以向阿富汗军队提供必要的空中支持。

奥巴马总统曾表示，美国明年在阿富汗的任务只限于训练阿富汗军队和对基地组织展开反恐怖行动。
