**波罗申科称乌克兰2020年申请加入欧盟**

乌克兰总统波罗申科说，乌克兰将申请于2020年加入欧盟，这是乌克兰社会与经济全面改革计划的一部分。

波罗申科说，这些改革将为乌克兰申请加入欧盟创造条件。

乌克兰的入盟愿望以及俄罗斯的反对去年在乌克兰引发抗议活动，导致时任总统亚努科维奇下台以及俄罗斯吞并克里米亚半岛。

乌克兰总理亚采纽克星期三呼吁国际社会继续制裁俄罗斯，直至基辅重新控制包括克里米亚在内的全部乌克兰领土。

亚采纽克在联合国大会发言时直接向俄罗斯总统传递了一个信息。

他说，俄罗斯侵犯乌克兰部分领土，武装亲俄反叛分子，吞并克里米亚半岛，这些行为违反了国际法。

星期三早些时候，亚采纽克对与亲俄反叛武装实现停火表示怀疑，称停火非常脆弱。他说，乌克兰能够很容易地制止分离主义，恢复国家和平。但是他表示，乌克兰武装部队不能与训练有素和装备精良的俄罗斯军队对抗。

尽管莫斯科否认，但有充分证据表明，俄罗斯军队支持了乌克兰东部的反叛武装，乌克兰境内现在仍有俄罗斯部队。北约说，一些俄罗斯军队还留在乌克兰。

Poroshenko: Ukraine to Apply for EU Membership in 2020

Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko says his country will apply for membership to the European Union in 2020 as part of a broader plan for social and economic reforms.

Mr. Poroshenko says those reforms will prepare Ukraine to apply for EU membership.

Ukraine's desire for European intergration, and Russia's opposition to it, sparked last year's protests which resulted in the ousting of former leader Viktor Yanukovych and Russia's annexation of the Crimean peninsula.

Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk on Wednesday has appealed to the international community to keep sanctions against Russia in place until Kyiv regains "control of its entire territory," including Crimea.

In comments to the U.N. General Assembly , Mr. Yatsenyuk delivered a direct message to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Mr. Yatsenyuk said that Russia has violated international laws by invading parts of Ukrainian territory, arming pro-Russian insurgents and annexing the Crimean peninsula.

Earlier Wednesday, the Ukrainian prime minister expressed skepticism about the cease-fire with pro-Russian rebels, calling it extremely fragile and shaky. He said Ukraine could easily deter separatists and restore peace in the country. But he said its armed forces cannot fight against the well-trained and well-equipped Russian military.

Although Moscow denies it, there has been ample evidence of Russian military support for insurgents in eastern Ukraine, and the presence of Russian troops on Ukrainian soil. NATO says some Russian troops remain.
