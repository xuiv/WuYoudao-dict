**菲律宾重判12名中国渔民**

菲律宾一家法院判处在南中国海非法捕鱼的12名中国渔民长期监禁。

这一举动很可能会加剧马尼拉和北京之间的紧张关系。中国和菲律宾都宣称对资源丰富的南中国海海域拥有主权。

这些中国渔民于2013年4月被逮捕，当时他们的渔船在菲律宾西部沿海的图巴塔哈群礁附近海域搁浅。

图巴塔哈群礁位于菲律宾领海之内，中国并未宣称对其拥有主权。这些中国渔民说，他们当时是在该海域躲避风暴。

这艘中国渔船的船长被判处12年监禁，其他11名渔民的刑期从6年到10年不等。

由于菲律宾当局发现这些中国渔民带有被保护动物鲮鲤，他们可能面临加刑。

这些中国渔民每人被罚款10万美元。他们不承认有罪。

Philippines Gives Hefty Jail Terms to 12 Chinese Fishermen

A court in the Philippines has given long jail sentences to 12 Chinese fishermen for fishing illegally in the South China Sea.

It is the latest incident likely to raise tensions between Manila and Beijing, which have competing claims in the resource-rich region.

The Chinese fishermen were arrested in April 2013 after their boat ran aground at the Tubbataha Reef in the western Philippines.

The coral reef is well within Philippine territory and is not claimed by China. The fishermen say they were taking refuge there during a storm.

The captain of the boat was given 12 years in prison. The 11 others received jail sentences ranging from six to 10 years.

The men face possible additional jail time because they were found in possession of a protected species of mammal called a pangolin.

The men, who also received a $100,000 fine each, pleaded not guilty to all the charges.

**日本：中国设立防空识别区极其危险**

日本星期二发表年度防务白皮书，就东京认为中国破坏地区稳定的行为再次发出警告。

这份白皮书对中国“极其危险”地宣布在东中国海设立防空识别区一事表示特别关注。该地区涵盖日本宣称拥有主权的岛屿。

日本内阁星期二通过的这份文件说，中国设立防空识别区是试图单方面改变现状，加剧紧张局势，并可能导致意想不到的后果。

围绕这些日本控制的岛屿的争端造成中日关系严重恶化。中国和日本经常派飞机和舰只到该地区，人们担心可能发生意外军事冲突。

Japan Slams China's 'Profoundly Dangerous' Air Defense Zone

Japan used an annual defense paper on Tuesday to issue a fresh warning about what it sees as China's destabilizing actions in the region.

The so-called white paper expressed particular concern about China's "profoundly dangerous" declaration of an Air Defense Identification Zone in a part of the East China Sea that includes islands also claimed by Japan.

The paper, which was adopted Tuesday by the Cabinet, said the ADIZ is an attempt by China to "unilaterally change the status quo, escalate the situation, and may cause unintended consequences."

The dispute over the Japan-controlled island chain has led to a serious deterioration in Sino-Japanese relations. China and Japan regularly send aircraft and vessels to the area, raising fears of an accidental military clash.
