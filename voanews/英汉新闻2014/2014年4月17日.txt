**有关乌克兰问题的四方国际会谈开始**

乌克兰、俄罗斯、美国和欧盟的外长星期四开始在日内瓦举行有关乌克兰问题的国际会谈。美国表示将观察俄罗斯是否有认真缓解乌克兰紧张局势的迹象。

奥巴马总统星期三在接受美国哥伦比亚广播公司(CBS)电视采访时说，俄罗斯每次采取行动破坏乌克兰稳定和践踏乌克兰主权，都会有后果，但是他说，他相信俄罗斯并不是在寻求战争。

俄罗斯声称有权保护乌克兰境内讲俄语的人。俄罗斯还指责乌克兰新领导人反俄罗斯， 反犹太人，并威胁到亲俄罗斯人的权利。

联合国人权问题高级官员伊万·萨蒙维奇星期三对安理会说，他和他的工作小组3月两次访问乌克兰，并没有看到俄罗斯族人普遍受到攻击。

莫斯科称联合国的报告是有偏见和毫无根据的。

Four-way Ukraine Talks Begin

International talks on Ukraine have begun in Geneva, where the United States says it will look for any signs Russia is serious about de-escalating tensions.

The talks involve the foreign ministers of Ukraine, Russia, the United States, and the European Union.

In an interview Wednesday with CBS television, President Barack Obama said there will be consequences each time Russia takes steps to destabilize Ukraine and violate its sovereignty. But Mr. Obama said he is convinced Russia is not looking for a war.

Moscow has said it has the right to protect Russian speakers in Ukraine. It accuses the new Ukrainian leadership of being anti-Russian and anti-Semitic and of threatening the rights of pro-Russians.

But senior U.N. human rights official Ivan Simonvic told the Security Council Wednesday that during two trips to Ukraine in March, his team found no widespread attacks against ethnic-Russians.

Moscow calls the U.N. report biased and unfounded.

**澳总理：无人潜艇可能一周内结束失踪客机搜寻**

澳大利亚总理阿博特说，在印度洋海底搜寻马航失踪客机的“蓝鳍21”无人潜艇将在一周内结束搜寻行动。

阿博特对华尔街日报说，如果“蓝鳍21”在一周内没有发现失踪客机残骸，有关当局将停止搜寻，重新进行部署，并考虑下一步如何行动。

澳大利亚搜寻行动协调中心星期四说，“蓝鳍21”首次完成了16个小时全程搜寻马航失踪客机的任务，此前两次海底搜寻都提前结束。

到目前为止，“蓝鳍21”搜寻了90平方公里的海底。但有关当局说，从无人潜艇获得的声纳数据中没有发现任何有价值的线索。

美国海军官员曾经警告说，“蓝鳍21”可能需要长达两个月来搜寻6百平方公里未经测绘的海域。

Australia PM: Submarine Could Finish Current Search for Malaysian Jet in a Week

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott says a robotic submarine scanning the Indian Ocean floor for the missing Malaysian jetliner will finish its current search within a week.

Mr. Abbott told the Wall Street Journal if the so-called Bluefin-21 submarine does not find any wreckage by then, authorities will stop, regroup, and reconsider how to proceed.

The Australian agency coordinating the search said Thursday the vehicle completed its first full 16-hour mission after two previous missions were cut short because of technical problems.

The Bluefin-21 has so far searched 90 square kilometers of the ocean bed. But authorities say they have found "no significant detection" in the sonar data collected.

U.S. Navy officials had previously warned it could take up to two months for the submarine to scan the current 600-square kilometer search area.
