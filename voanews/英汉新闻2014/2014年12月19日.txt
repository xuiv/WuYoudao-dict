**韩国对平壤被控组织黑客攻击暂表沉默**

韩国星期五表示，暂不对平壤是否幕后策划黑客攻击索尼影业事件作出判断。分析人士说，这次事件威胁到电影行业的金融活力。

韩国韩国统一部发言人林丙哲表示： “要求我国政府确认朝鲜是否幕后指使索尼影业黑客事件是不合适的。关于索尼影业决定取消播映和发行影片《采访》，我们的理解是，这一判断是索尼公司自己作出的。”

首尔街头，民众对取消发行这部虚构阴谋朝鲜领导人金正恩的影片发表看法。

首尔居民全永素说：“首先，我认为，停止发行影片《采访》的决定是明智之举，因为这是防止恐怖或者朝鲜威胁的最好方法。 不过，说到言论自由，其他处理办法也应得到考虑。”

她还表示：“我认为，影片推迟公映多少有点遗憾，因为某种意义上讲，发行这部影片本身可能会引起民众的注意。”

白宫目前将索尼影业遭受的网络攻击事件当作‘严重的国家安全问题’处理。

白宫发言人欧内斯特说：“这件事情目前正在被作为一次严重的国家安全问题处理。有证据显示，我们发现了破坏活动，其意图险恶，始作俑者老奸巨猾。”

欧内斯特还说，奥巴马总统的国家安全委员会正在考虑应对这次网络攻击的适当措施。

索尼取消了12月25日发行影片《采访》，因为一些主要连锁剧场决定不放映这部影片，此前一个自称‘和平卫士‘的黑客组织威胁伤害放映或者观看这部片子的人。

美国国土安全部表示，“尚无有关针对电影院现实阴谋的可靠情报。”奥巴马总统低调处理有关威胁。他说，他建议民众还是去看电影。

South Korea Mum on Pyongyang's Alleged Role in Hacking Incident

South Korea said Friday it is withholding judgment on whether Pyongyang was behind the Sony Pictures hacking incident that analysts say threatens the financial viability of the movie industry.

Lim Byeong-cheol, South Korean Ministry spokesman said: "It is not proper for our government to confirm whether North Korea was behind the Sony Pictures' hacking incident. Regarding Sony Pictures' decision to cancel the screening and release of the film 'The Interview', our understanding is that it was the company's own judgment."

On the streets of Seoul, people are speaking out about the cancelled release of the film about a fictional plot to kill the Korean leader Kim John Un.

Jeon Yeon-su, a Seoul resident, said: "First, I think it was a good decision not to release 'The Interview' because it is the best way to prevent terror, or North Korea's threats. However when it comes to the freedom of expression, another resolution should be considered"

"I think it is a bit unfortunate that the film release has been delayed as, in a sense, releasing the film itself could arouse citizens' attention," she added

The White House is treating a cyber attack on Sony Pictures as a "serious national security matter, but there has been no direct condemnation of North Korea for its alleged role in the hacking incident.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest said: “This is something that's being treated as a serious national security matter. There is evidence to indicate that we have seen destructive activity with malicious intent that was initiated by a sophisticated actor.''

The White House spokesman added that President Barack Obama's National Security Council is considering a proportionate response to the cyber attack.

Sony cancelled the December 25 release of "The Interview," after some major theater chains chose not to show it, after a hacker group calling itself Guardians of Peace threatened to harm anyone showing or attending the film.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security says "there is no credible intelligence to indicate an active plot against movie theaters." President Obama also downplayed the threat, saying his "recommendation would be that people go to the movies."


**巴基斯坦军队击毙多名武装分子**

巴基斯坦官员说，巴基斯坦战机和地面部队击毙了58名激进分子。星期二，塔利班武装分子袭击白沙瓦一所军队管理的学校，杀害了149人，其中大部分是学生。

在巴基斯坦开始第三天的全国悼念之际，政府军在阿富汗边境附近附近开伯尔的提拉山谷伏击并打死至少50名激进分子。还有8名激进分子在俾路支省被击毙，其中包括一名塔利班高级指挥官。

星期二发生在白沙瓦学校的屠杀事件震惊了世界，随后巴基斯坦总理谢里夫撤销了对死刑的暂停令。

星期四，巴基斯坦军队首脑签发了针对6名恐怖组织核心成员的死刑执行令。

巴基斯坦军方没有透露这6名激进分子的姓名。当地媒体报道说，只有在他们死后才公布姓名。

死刑执行令不容上诉，预计这些罪犯将在几天内被处以绞刑。

据称这些罪犯与袭击事件有关，包括激进分子袭击拉瓦尔品第的巴基斯坦军事总部以及针对前总统穆沙拉夫的暗杀企图。

国际特赦组织和人权观察指责谢里夫的决定。国际特赦说，这种“本能反应”，并未触及问题的实质。

Pakistan Targets Militants After School Massacre

Pakistani officials say jets and ground forces have killed 58 militants days after Taliban fighters attacked a school in the northwestern city of Peshawar, killing 149 people, mostly children.

As Pakistan began a third day of mourning, the troops ambushed and killed at least 50 militants in Khyber near the Afghan border. Another eight were killed in southwestern Baluchistan province, including a senior Taliban commander.

The massacre at the military-run school in Peshawar Tuesday shocked the world and prompted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to lift a moratorium on the death penalty.

On Thursday, the head of Pakistan's military signed the death warrants for six “hard-core terrorists.”

The army did not release the names of the convicts and local media reported they would only be identified after their death.

The warrants cannot be appealed, and the prisoners are expected to be hanged within days.

The convicts are said to be linked to attacks including a militant raid on the Pakistan military headquarters in Rawalpindi and assassination attempts against former President Pervez Musharraf.

Human rights advocacy groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have condemned Mr. Sharif's decision. Amnesty called it a "a knee-jerk reaction which does not get at the heart of the problem."
