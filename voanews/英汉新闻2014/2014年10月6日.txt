Afghanistan Lifts Ban on US Reporter

The New York Times reports a correspondent expelled from Afghanistan in August will be allowed to return, effective immediately.

The newspaper reported Sunday the Afghan attorney general's office has issued an order lifting the ban against reporter Matthew Rosenberg.

The Times says Afghanistan's newly installed President Ashraf Ghani called the Times' assistant international editor Sunday to tell him Rosenberg and any other reporters the newspaper wanted to send would be welcomed in Afghanistan.

Rosenberg was expelled and was barred from re-entry into Afghanistan because of an article he wrote about a group of officials considering seizing power and forming a government over the then unresolved presidential election. Rosenberg refused to reveal his sources.

Afghanistan's attorney general under former president Hamid Karzai said the article was "contrary to the national interest, security and stability of Afghanistan."

Hong Kong Returns to Work

Hong Kong civil servants returned to work at the government's headquarters Monday as pro-democracy protests that have paralyzed the area for more than a week subsided.

The workers were allowed to pass through protesters' barricades without being stopped.

Authorities had set a Monday deadline to clear the streets so businesses, school and government offices could re-open.

Pro-democracy demonstrators on Sunday removed some barriers blocking access to the government's downtown headquarters and left the area. But the protesters appeared divided, and some vowed to stay put.

Student protest leaders say they have been holding talks with government officials on possible formal discussions with Hong Kong Chief Secretary Carrie Lam, who was appointed last week by Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying to begin a dialogue with the students.
