**印度女外交官柯布拉加德离开美国**

印度女外交官柯布拉加德已经离开美国，她涉嫌在为其保姆申请签证时撒谎，此事导致印度与美国之间的分歧。

柯布拉加德星期四晚间乘飞机离开美国，此前印度拒绝了美国提出的免除其豁免权的要求。

柯布拉加德本是印度驻纽约的副总领事，但按照标准程序，美国官员星期四接受印度方面的要求，将柯布拉加德的驻美身份改为驻联合国的外交官，给予她全面豁免权。

在柯布拉加德获得全面豁免权后，美国国务院要求印度免除她的这一权利，以便美方对她提出起诉，但印度拒绝了这一要求。

美国国务院发言人说，柯布拉加德离境后，针对她的指控不会撤销，而一旦她返回美国，将会面临起诉。

Indian Diplomat Leaves US

An Indian diplomat at the center of a disagreement with the United States for allegedly lying on a visa application for her maid has left the U.S.

Devyani Khobragade flew out of the U.S. Thursday night after India turned down a U.S. request to waive her diplomatic immunity.

Khobragade had been serving as India's deputy consel general in New York. However, on Thursday - following standard procedure - U.S. officials accepted India's request to change her accreditation to the United Nations as a diplomat, giving her full immunity.

Once she had full immunity, the State Department asked India to waive it so that Khobragade could face charges. But India denied the request.

The spokesman said the charges against her will not be dropped upon leaving the country, and she will face them if she returns.

**以色列宣布计划在西岸增建定居点住房**

以色列宣布计划在约旦河西岸和东耶路撒冷修建1400个新住宅。在脆弱的巴以和谈进行之际，以色列的决定肯定会让巴勒斯坦人感到不安。

以色列住房部星期五宣布将在以色列军队1967年以来占领的约旦河西岸和东耶路撒冷分别修建800和600个定居点住房。

据信以色列总理内塔尼亚胡企图以此来平息部分内阁成员对释放巴勒斯坦囚犯的不满。

根据由美国国务卿克里斡旋达成的协议，以色列上个月释放了26名巴勒斯坦囚犯。以色列官员说，他们等克里离开中东之后才宣布了增建定居点住房的计划。

巴勒斯坦人威胁说，如果以色列实施这个计划，他们就会退出谈判，甚至可能采取法律行动。这些住宅将建在巴勒斯坦人希望未来建立的巴勒斯坦国的土地上。


Israel Announces Plans for New Settlement Homes in West Bank

Israel has announced plans for 1,400 new settlement homes in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, a move certain to upset Palestinians during a time of already fragile peace talks.

The Israeli Housing Ministry on Friday announced that 800 homes would be built in the West Bank and 600 in East Jerusalem, both areas occupied by Israel's military since 1967.

The move had been expected as part of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's efforts to calm concerns by some in his government about the release of Palestinian prisoners.

The 26 prisoners were freed last month as part of a peace effort brokered by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. Israeli officials said they waited until Kerry left the region to announce the settlements.

Palestinians have threatened to walk out of the talks, and possibly pursue legal action, if Israel goes ahead with the settlements, which are built on land Palestinians want as part of a separate state.
