Genocide Trial Begins for Aging Khmer Rouge Leaders

A United Nations-backed tribunal has begun the second trial of the two most senior surviving members of the Khmer Rouge.

Ex-head of state Khieu Samphan and chief ideologue Nuon Chea face genocide charges at the trial that began Wednesday in Phnom Penh.

The two aging leaders are already set to be sentenced on August 7 after being tried for crimes against humanity in the first trial that ended last year.

At the hearing Wednesday, Khieu Samphan appeared to be in good health, taking notes alongside his defense team. Nuon Chea did not attend.

The second trial will focus on the mass killings of hundreds of thousands of Cambodia's Vietnamese and Cham Muslim ethnic minorities.

Simach Smam, a Cham Muslim who survived the Khmer Rouge's 1975-1979 rule, was one of those attending the hearing.


**中国媒体赞扬中共审查周永康**

中国国家媒体赞扬中共决定对退休高官周永康腐败案进行审查。

中共星期二晚间宣布对周永康“严重违纪”进行审查。违纪细节未作任何说明。周永康曾主管中国的安全事务。

现年71岁的周永康曾担任中共中央政治局常委，于2012年退休。中共中央政治局是中国的最高决策机构。

对周永康的审查打破了长期以来的一条不成文规定，即中共高层领导人可以免受纪律处罚。

中共控制的《环球时报》发表社论说，这一举措显示了中国领导层对腐败的零容忍。

社论还说，中国民众欢迎对周永康进行审查，并说民众现在更有理由相信所有官员都要遵纪守法。

中国官方的新华社说，宣布审查周永康显示中共决心纯洁队伍，施行严格的纪律。

中国国家主席习近平自2012年掌权以来，一直高调反腐，誓言“老虎”、“苍蝇”一起打。


Chinese State Media Praise Zhou Corruption Probe

Chinese state media are praising the Communist Party's decision to open a corruption probe into retired senior politician Zhou Yongkang.

The party announced late Tuesday it is investigating Zhou, China's former security czar, for unspecified "serious disciplinary violation."

The 71-year-old Zhou, who retired in 2012, was a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, China's highest governing body.

The investigation breaks a longstanding, unwritten rule that China's top leaders would be immune from such discipline.

In an editorial, the party-controlled Global Times said the move "reveals the zero tolerance stance of the Chinese leadership toward corruption."

It said the Chinese public embraced the probe, saying it is now "more convincing" to believe all officials will be subject to the rule of law.

The official Xinhua news agency said the announcement shows the party's determination to "purify itself and run itself with strict discipline."

Since taking power in 2012, President Xi Jinping has carried out a highly publicized graft crackdown, vowing to go after both high-ranking "tigers" and low-ranking "flies."
