**Kerry in Iraq to Press for More Inclusive Government**

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is in Iraq on an unannounced visit as the government faces the challenge of countering Sunni Islamist militants who have captured wide areas in the northern and western parts of the country.

Kerry arrived Monday in Baghdad and was scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki as well as Sunni and Kurdish leaders.

He will continue U.S. pressure for Mr. Maliki to be more inclusive in his Shi'ite-led government, which has faced criticism for shutting out Sunnis and Kurds and breeding sectarian tensions.

Kerry discussed Iraq and the threat posed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant - ISIL - as he met Sunday with his counterparts in Egypt and Jordan. He told reporters in Cairo that if Iraqis want a more inclusive government, the United States will help.

**马来西亚最高法裁决只有穆斯林可用“安拉”**
马来西亚最高法院支持政府禁止一家罗马天主教会的报纸用“安拉”指称上帝。
马来西亚联邦法院星期一以四比三的表决结果判定，这家教会的马来语报纸“前驱报”没有理由对去年一家下级法院的判决提出上诉。那家法院判定，只有穆斯林可以使用“安拉”这一指称，根据是如果其他宗教也用“安拉”，就可能导致混乱，致使穆斯林转信其他宗教。
在马来西亚，穆斯林转信其他宗教属于非法。马来西亚人口为3千万，其中穆斯林超过60%。伊斯兰教是马来西亚的国教。在马来西亚，基督教徒只占人口的9%。

** Top Malaysian Court Rules 'Allah' Only for Muslims**

Malaysia's highest court has upheld a government ban against a Roman Catholic newspaper using the world "Allah" to refer to God.

The Federal Court ruled in a four-to-three decision Monday that the church's Malay-language newspaper, The Herald, had no grounds to appeal a lower court decision last year that Allah should be reserved exclusively for Muslims, because if other religions use the word, it could be confusing and lead Muslims to convert.

Such conversion is illegal in Malaysia where more than 60 percent of the population of 30 million are Muslim - the country's official religion. Just over 9 percent are Christian.
