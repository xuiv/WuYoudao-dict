**巴西周日投票选举总统**

数以百万计的巴西人星期天将在总统选举中投票，预计这个月晚些时候还将进行决选的竞选和投票。

分析人士表示，争取第二个任期的迪尔玛・罗塞芙，被认为在星期天的投票中会得票最多，但是不可能获得避免决选所需要的绝对多数票。

罗塞芙总统有两位主要的对手。玛瑞纳・席尔瓦是全球环保运动的英雄，脱离执政党转投巴西社会主义党。社会民主党的阿埃西奥・内韦斯是位参议员和前州长。

批评人士说，罗塞芙总统可以依赖巴西劳工阶层的选票，受益于她的广受欢迎的前任和政治教父席尔瓦总统两个任期内启动的慷慨的社会福利项目。

Brazil Voting for President

Millions of Brazilians are going to the polls Sunday to vote in the presidential race that is expected to result in a runoff campaign and election later this month.

Analysts say President Dilma Rousseff, who is seeking a second term, is seen as the top vote getter in Sunday's poll, but she is not likely to win the absolute majority needed to avoid a runoff.

Ms. Rousseff has two main rivals. Marina Silva is a hero of the global conservation movement and is a ruling party defector now with the Brazilian Socialist Party. Social Democrat Aecio Neves is a senator and former state governor.

Critics say President Rousseff can count on support from Brazil's working class, thanks to generous social welfare programs initiated during the two terms of her hugely popular predecessor and political godfather, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.


**叙重要边境城镇遭伊斯兰国武装强攻**

库尔德官员表示，伊斯兰国极端组织武装星期六从3个战线轰击叙利亚边境城镇柯巴尼。

这是激进分子试图夺取该镇的最新攻势。库尔德武装在美国领导的国际空袭行动的支援下，目前固守这个城镇。

大约16万人为躲避柯巴尼周边地区的战事，越过边界逃入土耳其。这里的冲突据说转移了对叙利亚内战的关注。

柯巴尼及其附近地区自9月中以来一直受到伊斯兰国组织武装的攻击，试图在他们位于叙利亚阿勒颇的阵地和以东方向拉卡的据点之间打开一条通道。伊斯兰国组织武装已经占领了几十个附近的库尔德村庄。

另外，美国副总统拜登为其有关评论向土耳其总统埃尔多安道歉。拜登曾表示，土耳其曾允许伊斯兰武装分子穿过其边境进入叙利亚，并帮助提供武器给激进组织。

Syrian Border Town under Constant Attack by Islamic State Militants

Kurdish officials say Islamic State forces shelled the Syrian border town of Kobani from three fronts Saturday.

The attacks are the latest attempts by militants to take the town, defended by Kurdish forces backed by U.S.-led airstrikes.

An estimated 160,000 people have fled across the border into Turkey to escape the fighting around Kobani; a conflict now said to be overshadowing Syria's wider civil war.

Kobani and its surrounding areas have been under attack since mid-September by Islamic State fighters trying to open a direct link between their positions in the Syrian province of Aleppo and their stronghold of Raqqa, to the east. The Islamic State group has captured dozens of nearby Kurdish villages.

In another development, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden has apologized to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for comments suggesting Turkey had allowed Islamic fighters to pass through its border into Syria and helped arm militant groups.
