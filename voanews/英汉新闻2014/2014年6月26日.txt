**中国当局在新疆公判九人**

中国在不断发生暴力事件的新疆继续反恐运动，对九个人进行公开宣判。

中国国家媒体说，这九个人的刑期从3年到14年，罪名包括宣扬圣战以及煽动分离主义和民族仇恨。

《人民日报》说，3千人参加了公判大会。中国当局试图利用举行公判大会的方式赢得公众对镇压行动的支持。

公判大会在察布查尔县举行。当地一名官员说，公判大会是一场反恐“人民战争”，并声称公民应当坚决粉碎敌人的罪恶阴谋。

中国当局上星期宣布，在新疆一年打击暴恐运动的第一个月，逮捕了将近380名嫌疑人，并对315人定罪。

去年，新疆有大约2百人死于骚乱，其中很多人死于一系列计划得越来越周密的针对平民的袭击。

China Sentences 9 More in Xinjiang

China is continuing its anti-terror campaign in the violence-hit western region of Xinjiang, sentencing nine more people to jail at a public rally.

State media say the jail sentences ranged from three to 14 years for offenses including preaching jihad and inciting separatism and ethnic hatred.

The People's Daily says 3,000 people attended the mass sentencing, which authorities are using to try to win public support for their crackdown.

An official in Qapqal county, where the sentencing was held, called for a "people's war" against terrorism, saying citizens should "resolutely smash the evil plots of the enemy."

Authorities last week announced they arrested almost 380 suspects and convicted over 315 people during the first month of the year-long security crackdown in Xinjiang.

Around 200 people have died in unrest over the past year in Xinjiang, many in a series of increasingly complex attacks targeting civilians.

**克里在巴黎讨论伊拉克问题**

美国国务卿克里星期四在巴黎会见约旦、沙特阿拉伯和阿拉伯联合酋长国的外长，继续努力解决伊拉克危机问题。

美国国务院说，会谈内容包括伊拉克安全局势及其邻国叙利亚的内战问题。

伊拉克总理马利基星期三表态拒绝组建一个紧急状态政府。他说，此举将违反伊拉克宪法，而且不符合4月30日议会选举的结果。

这个立场令逃离激进分子攻势的伊拉克人感到不安。其中一人说：“根本谈不上安全局势。 激进分子向哈穆迪亚发射火箭炮弹，当地人都逃走了。我们看不到任何军队， 没有岗哨，没有军队，也没有当官的。 我们只好扔下一切财产，扔下我们的家具和钱财， 跑了出来。”

美国国务卿克里在布鲁塞尔的北约会议上说， 美国关心谁出面领导伊拉克，但美国在伊拉克组建新政府之际不会进行干预。克里国务卿说：“我们要记住，‘伊拉克和黎凡特伊斯兰国’是恐怖主义军队，他们不仅威胁到伊拉克，而且威胁到中东地区反对他们的每个国家， 威胁到欧洲和美国。要打赢这场战斗， 伊拉克人必须最终团结起来，组成一个包容性政府。”

联合国驻伊拉克特别代表姆拉登诺夫认为国际社会在解决伊拉克危机方面有很大影响力。

联合国伊拉克特别代表姆拉登诺夫说：“伊拉克冲突有可能进一步宗派化，但是我认为国际社会对这个危险了解的越多，这个危险就越小。 ”

有人批评马利基政府排斥少数派，造成宗派紧张关系。从基地组织分离出来的伊拉克和黎凡特伊斯兰国激进组织已攻占了伊拉克北部和西部的大片地区。

美国宣布向伊拉克派遣300名军事顾问，帮助伊拉克打击激进分子。

Kerry in Paris Meeting on Iraq

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is continuing his focus on the crisis in Iraq as he meets Thursday in Paris with his counterparts from Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

The State Department says the talks will include both the security situation in Iraq and the civil war in neighboring Syria.

Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's on Wednesday decided not to form an emergency government to help the country out of its crisis. Mr. Maliki said such a move would go against the country's constitution and the results of Iraq's April 30 parliamentary elections.

The Prime Minister's stance provided little comfort for thousands trying to outrun the militants. One of them said: "The security situation now is zero. We've seen no soldiers, no army, nobody. There are no checkpoints, there is not army. We haven't seen officials at all. So we left our stuff, our beds, our money."

In Brussels, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told reporters at a NATO meeting that the U.S. is interested in who leads Iraq, but is not interfering as Baghdad forms a new government. Kerry said: "We need to remember that ISIL is a terrorist army that threatens not only Iraq, but threatens every country in the region which is opposed to it, and Europe and the United States. Succeeding in this fight is going to require Iraqis to come together finally, in order to form an inclusive government

The U.N's special representative in Iraq, Nickolay Mladenov, believes the international community has a greater influence in resolving the conflict. He said: "The risk of further sectarian or sectarianization of the conflict remains, however, I think the more the international community is aware of that risk, the more that risk is mitigated

Mr. Maliki's Shi'ite-led government has faced criticism of sidelining the minorities and breeding sectarian tensions. The militants from the al-Qaida breakaway group called the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant have seized vast areas across northern and western Iraq.

The United States is sending up to 300 military advisers to help Iraq counter the militants.
