**北京就美指控中国军方网络犯罪事召见美大使**

美国指控五名中国军官针对美国公司进行经济间谍活动后，中国召见了美国驻华大使。

中国官方的新华社星期二说，中国外交部长助理郑泽光对美国大使鲍卡斯说，这一指控严重损害了中美关系。

中国拒绝接受美国提出的刑事指控。这是美国首次指控外国职员对美国公司进行网络犯罪。

美国官员指控中国人民解放军所属部队侵入核技术、太阳能和钢铁工业领域的美国公司的电脑网络。

美国司法部长霍尔德星期一说，所有国家都从事情报搜集工作，但美国谴责军事间谍活动，这种活动为包括国有企业在内的中国公司提供重要信息。

中国外交部说，美国的指控纯属无中生有，并表示这种指控将损害两国政府间的互信。 作为抗议， 北京表示将中止中美网络工作组的活动。

中国国防部星期二发表声明，指责美国有着不可告人的目的，并指华盛顿“虚伪”和采用“双重标准”。

China Summons US Ambassador After Spying Charges

China has summoned the U.S. ambassador after Washington charged five Chinese military officers with conducting economic espionage against American companies.

The official Xinhua news agency says Assistant Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang told U.S. Ambassador Max Baucus the charges "seriously harmed" U.S.-China relations.

China has rejected the criminal allegations, the first ever leveled by the U.S. against a foreign power for cybercrimes targeting American businesses.

U.S. officials accuse a unit of China's People's Liberation Army of hacking into the computers of U.S. companies working in nuclear technology, solar power and the steel industry.

The top U.S. prosecutor, Attorney General Eric Holder, said Monday that Washington "categorically denounces" the military espionage that provided "significant" information for Chinese companies, including state-owned enterprises.

China's foreign ministry denounced the charges as "fabricated" and said Beijing is suspending the activities of a Sino-U.S. Internet working group.

In a statement Tuesday, China's Defense Ministry accused the U.S. of having "ulterior motives" and denounced what it said was Washington's "hypocrisy and double standards."

**中情局：不再利用疫苗接种项目搜集情报**

白宫保证，美国中央情报局今后不再利用接种疫苗项目做掩护来从事间谍活动。美国三年前发动突袭行动击毙本拉登，此前中情局采取了这种策略。

白宫发言人说，奥巴马总统的首席反恐事务顾问莫纳科对十几所美国知名医学院院长上星期的一封来信做出答复，他们担心中情局的这一策略可能在公共保健领域造成严重后果。

莫纳科对这些院长说，中情局不再利用接种疫苗项目或人员从事情报搜集工作。中情局还同意不再使用来自这类项目的遗传物质。

2011年，中情局招募了巴基斯坦医生阿弗里迪，由他提出在巴基斯坦城市阿伯塔巴德实行一个肝炎疫苗接种项目，以便从本拉登的住地获取DNA样本。在外国采取行动之前，美国要确认本拉登的所在地点。

阿弗里迪被判犯有叛国罪，并在巴基斯坦被判33年监禁。这一判决于2013年被推翻，阿弗里迪目前面临重审。

CIA: No More Using Vaccination Programs for Spying

The White House has pledged that the CIA will no longer use vaccination programs as a cover for spying operations, three years after the agency used the ruse in Pakistan before the U.S. raid that killed Osama bin Laden.

A White House spokesperson says President Barack Obama's top counterterrorism adviser, Lisa Monaco, responded to a letter from the deans of about a dozen prominent public health schools last week who were concerned the ruse could cause serious consequences to public health efforts.

Monaco told the deans the CIA has agreed it would no longer use vaccination programs or workers for intelligence purposes. The CIA also agreed not to use genetic materials obtained through such programs.

In 2011, the CIA recruited Pakistani doctor Shakil Afridi to offer a program of hepatitis vaccinations in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad as cover to obtain DNA samples from the bin Laden compound. The United States wanted to make sure bin Laden was there before launching an operation into another country.

Afridi was convicted of treason and sentenced to 33 years in a Pakistani prison. The sentence was overturned in 2013, and Afridi now faces a retrial.
