**亲俄罗斯军队控制了乌克兰海军司令部**

亲俄罗斯军队控制了克里米亚港口城市塞瓦斯托波尔的乌克兰海军司令部。一天前俄罗斯与克里米亚地方当局签署条约，使克里米亚成为俄罗斯的一部分。

目击者说，至少有200名没有武装的克里米亚自卫军星期三进入基地，升起俄罗斯国旗。据报道，乌克兰军人没有反抗，没有发生暴力冲突。

最近几个星期俄罗斯派数千名军人占领了克里米亚。俄罗斯族人占多数的克里米亚上星期天举行公投，赞成脱离乌克兰加入和罗斯。

俄罗斯总统普京吞并克里米亚的做法令美国和欧盟感到愤怒。 他们宣布克里米亚公投是非法的，并对俄罗斯采取了制裁行动。

但是普京早些时候对俄罗斯议会说，克里米亚一直是俄罗斯“不可分割的”一部分。他说，星期天的全民公投是合法的。

Pro-Russian Forces Seize Ukraine Navy Headquarters

Pro-Russian forces have taken control of Ukraine's navy headquarters in the Crimean port of Sevastopol, a day after Russia signed a treaty with local authorities to make Crimea part of Russia.

Witnesses say at least 200 of the unarmed self-defense forces entered the base Wednesday and put up the Russian flag. There was no violence, as Ukrainian service members reportedly did not resist the takeover.

Thousands of Russian soldiers have overtaken Crimea in recent weeks. The majority-Russian region voted in a referendum Sunday to break away from Ukraine and join Russia.

Russian President Vladimir Putin's moves to annex Crimea have angered the United States and European Union, which have declared the referendum illegal and imposed sanctions on Russia in response.

But Mr. Putin told the Russian parliament Tuesday the vote was legal and that Crimea has always been an "inalienable" part of Russia.

**新一轮伊朗核问题谈判在维也纳举行**

星期三，伊朗与世界六强国继续围绕伊朗核项目问题进行谈判，争取达成一项确保伊朗核项目属于和平性质的长期协议。
本轮谈判星期二在维也纳开始举行，欧盟外交政策首脑阿什顿的发言人迈克尔•曼说，各方代表进行了具有实质意义的有益讨论。他表示不会对谈判结果做出任何预测。
伊朗和六强国去年达成一项临时协议，规定伊朗限制其最敏感的核活动，以换取国际社会放松制裁。六强国包括美国、英国、中国、法国、俄罗斯和德国。
在谈判进行之际，多名美国参议员要求长期协议应包含一系列“核心原则”。

Iran Nuclear Talks Continue After 'Substantive' Discussions

Iran and a group of six world powers continue their negotiations on Iran's nuclear program Wednesday, as they seek a longterm agreement to ensure it is peaceful in nature.

This round of talks in Vienna began Tuesday with what a spokesman for European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton called "substantive and useful" discussions. The spokesman, Michael Mann, said he would not make any predictions about the outcome.

Iran and the group that includes the United States, Britain, China, France, Russia and Germany reached an interim deal last year for Iran to curb its most sensitive nuclear activity in exchange for limited sanctions relief.

As the talks go on, a large group of U.S. senators is calling for a set of "core principles" it wants to see in a permanent deal.
