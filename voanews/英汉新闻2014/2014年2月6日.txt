**美官员：中国应澄清或调整南中国海领土主张**

美国负责东亚事务的高级外交官指称中国在南中国海的广泛领土主张不符合国际法，应该予以澄清或调整。

中国声称拥有几乎全部350万平方公里的南中国海，凭着所谓九虚线内的中国认为是其历史权利的依据。越南、菲律宾、台湾、马来西亚和文莱也声称拥有该地区的部分地区。

周三在国会作证时，美国国务院负责东亚和太平洋事务的助理国务卿丹尼•拉塞尔说，任何使用九虚线的海洋权益要求必须根据必须根据陆地特征，比如一个国家的海岸线或岛屿。

拉塞尔说，人们“越来越关注” ，中国正试图逐步强调对该地区的控制，不顾其邻国的反对。他举出中国好几次“升高紧张局势 ”的行动作为例证。

拉塞尔还指出了美国新近对中国在东中国海的活动所感到的关切。北京不久前在该地区设立了一个防空识别区，而日本也声称拥有对这个区域。

US Official to China: Clarify or Adjust South China Sea Claims

The United States' top diplomat on East Asia has suggested China's wide-ranging territorial claims in the South China Sea do not comply with international law and should be clarified or adjusted.

China claims nearly the entire 3.5-million square kilometer South China Sea, by virtue of what it sees as its historical rights within the so-called nine-dash line. Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei also claims parts of the region.

In congressional testimony Wednesday, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Danny Russel said any use of the nine-dash line to claim maritime rights must be based on land features, such as a nation's coastline or its islands.

Russel said there were "growing concerns" that China is trying to gradually assert control over the area, despite objections by its neighbors. He cited several Chinese actions that recently have "raised tensions."

Russel also raised fresh U.S. concerns over China's activities in the East China Sea, where Beijing recently set up an Air Defense Identification Zone in an area also claimed by Japan.

**缅甸指控五名新闻业者泄露“国家机密”**

缅甸对一家周刊的四名记者和一名首席执行官提出指控，称他们发表了一篇据称是关于化学武器工厂的报道，从而违反了缅甸的国家秘密法。

这起案件再度让人们对缅甸的新闻自由感到关注。缅甸自从2011年结束了直接的军人统治之后，进行了一系列的改革。

这篇报道1月25日刊登在仰光的《团结杂志》上。报道声称，缅甸中部的包镇正在修建一座秘密化武工厂。

政府方面承认这座范围足有12平方公里的设施是国防部的工厂，但否认与化学武器有任何关系。

周刊的四名编辑及首席执行官在上星期被捕。国家媒体星期三晚间说，他们已被指控泄露国家机密以及非法擅入工厂禁区。

有关官员说，控罪的依据是缅甸90年之久的《国家秘密法》，不过，当局没有说报道到底泄露了什么国家机密。

Burma Charges 5 Journalists for Disclosing 'State Secrets'

Burma has charged four reporters and the chief executive officer of a weekly journal with violating the country's state secret law for publishing a story on an alleged chemical weapons factory.

The case is renewing concerns about media freedom in Burma, also known as Myanmar, which has undergone a series of reforms since direct military rule ended in 2011.

The story, which appeared in the Rangoon-based Unity Journal on January 25, claimed a secret chemical weapons factory was being built in central Burma's Pauk township.

The government has acknowledged that the sprawling, 12-square kilometer facility is a defense ministry factory, but denies it has anything to do with chemical weapons.

The four editors and CEO were arrested last week. State media said late Wednesday they have been charged with disclosing official secrets and trespassing on restricted areas of the factory.

Officials said the charges were brought in accordance with Burma's 90-year-old State Secrets Act, though it is unclear what state secret, if any, was unveiled in the article.
