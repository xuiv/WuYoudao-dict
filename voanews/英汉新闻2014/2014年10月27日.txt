**巴西总统罗塞夫当选连任**

巴西总统罗塞夫星期天晚间在首都巴西利亚连任获胜演说中表示，要团结全国上下，重振巴西的经济，大力反击腐败，并聆听选民要求改革的声音。

现年66岁的罗塞夫在决选当中赢得了51.6%的选票。她的对手赢得了48.4%的选票，两人得票数相差很小。这是巴西劳工党连续第四次赢得大选。

罗塞夫早年是一位信仰马克思主义的游击队员。在这次选举当中，罗塞夫赢得了足够的来自中产阶级的选票，成功连任。接下来的挑战是如何把巴西比较贫困的北部地区和相对富足的南部地区团结起来。

除此之外，团结两极分化的巴西、赢得市场和投资者的信心、重振巴西停滞的经济、反击腐败，也是罗塞夫要面临的挑战。

President Dilma Rousseff Wins Second Term

Brazil's president promised to reconcile the country, reboot the economy, fight corruption, and listen to voters’ demand for change in a victory speech late Sunday in the capital, Brasilia.

Dilma Rousseff, 66, was elected by a narrow margin, winning 51.6 percent of the vote to 48.4 percent for her rival, business favorite Aecio Neves, in a run-off election. This was the fourth straight win for her Workers' Party (PT).

A Marxist guerrilla in her youth, Ms. Rousseff won enough middle-class votes to govern an already divided country between the poor north and the rich south.

She is facing a number of challenges - reuniting a polarized Brazil, winning back the confidence of the markets and investors, revitalizing the stagnant economy and combat corruption.

Tunisian Officials Counting Ballots in Parliament Vote

Election officials in Tunisia are counting ballots Monday after a key vote to select the country's first parliament since adopting a new constitution in January.

Preliminary results could be announced Monday with the final tally due by Thursday.

Ahead of the vote, the moderate Islamist Ennahda Party and leading secular party Nidaa Tounes were expected to win the most seats in the 217-member parliament.

Nidaa Tounes leader Beji Caid Essebsi said his party had "positive indications" it could be leading after polls closed Sunday.

Some 90 parties competed in the election, the latest democratic step since Tunisians overthrew autocrat Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in 2011.

Ennahda dominated post-revolution elections that year, and party leader Rachid Ghannouchi described Sunday's vote as "historic."

In the United States, President Barack Obama hailed the election an important milestone in the country's historic political transition. He said Tunisians continue to "inspire people across their region and around the world."
