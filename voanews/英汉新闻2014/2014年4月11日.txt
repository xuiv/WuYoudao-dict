**北约卫星图像显示俄在乌克兰边境屯兵四万 **

北约公布的卫星图像显示，在乌克兰边界附近有北约所说的整装待命的4万俄罗斯军队，还有坦克、飞机和其他军事装备。

这些卫星图像是星期四向各大媒体公布的。此前，俄罗斯不断保证，国际社会不必为这些部队感到惊慌。

与此同时，基辅政府正在寻求化解东乌克兰的紧张局势，那里的亲俄抗议者本周早些时候占领了政府办公楼，并要求为加入俄罗斯联邦举行公投。

不过，包括星期三公布的几个民调都显示，东部主要城市顿涅茨克的居民绝大多数都反对采取加入俄罗斯的任何行动。 民调公司与顿涅茨克国立大学共同进行的这次民调显示，顿涅茨克不到27%的居民支持占领政府办公楼，希望脱离乌克兰的人也只有4%。

盖洛普和国际共和研究所一起进行的民调显示， 只有4%的受访者赞成分裂。这项调查结果公布于4月5日。

白宫说，奥巴马总统星期四通过电话与德国总理默克尔进行磋商。奥巴马和默克尔再次敦促莫斯科从乌克兰边境地区撤军。

NATO Recon Shows 40,000 Russian Troops, Hardware on Ukraine

NATO has released satellite photographs showing what it says are 40,000 Russian troops massed near the Ukraine border, along with tanks, aircraft and other hardware said to be awaiting orders from Moscow.

The imagery, released to news outlets Wednesday, follows repeated Russian assurances that the deployment is no cause for international alarm.

That satellite intelligence comes as the government in Kyiv seeks to defuse tensions in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian protesters seized control of government buildings earlier this week and issued demands for a vote on joining the Russian Federation.

However, several surveys, including a poll released Wednesday, have found that residents of the key eastern city of Donetsk overwhelmingly oppose any move to join Russia. That survey, conducted March 26-29 in conjunction with Donetsk National University, showed less than 27 percent of city residents supporting the building seizures, and only 4 percent wanting to separate from Ukraine.

A poll conducted by the Gallup organization in conjunction with the International Republican Institute found just 4 percent of respondents favoring secession. That survey was released April 5.

The White House says President Barack Obama conferred with German Chancellor Angela Merkel by phone Thursday, and that both leaders again called on Moscow to pull back its troops from the border regions.

**澳大利亚确信声音信号来自马航失踪客机 **
澳大利亚当局说，他们确信，搜寻失踪马航客机行动中探测到的水下信号来自这架飞机的黑匣子。

澳大利亚总理阿博特星期五在上海对记者说，搜寻人员收窄了在印度洋搜索的范围，他们目前正在那一带搜索声音信号。

阿博特向中国国家主席习近平简要介绍了搜寻的进度。这架失踪客机上大约三分之二乘客是中国人。

澳大利亚海军使用美国海军探测黑匣子的设备探测到了跟飞行数据记录仪一致的信号。

鉴于飞机黑匣子定位仪信标的电池在大约30天后将耗尽，当局应该尽快确定发出信号的方位。

载有239人的这架马航客机3月8日在从吉隆坡飞往北京的途中失踪。

马来西亚当局认为，这架客机被蓄意转向，然后坠入大海。不过找不到飞机残骸，这让许多人持怀疑态度。

如果当局能够探测到更多信号声，他们计划部署水下机器人，到海底探查。

一旦黑匣子被复原，当局就能确定这架客机失踪的原因。马航370客机的失踪成为航空历史上最令人费解的迷之一。

Australia Confident Sounds are from Missing Malaysian Jet

Australian authorities say they are confident that underwater signals detected in the search for missing the Malaysian jetliner are from the airplane's black box recorders.

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told reporters in Shanghai Friday that search crews looking for the plane have narrowed down that patch of Indian Ocean where they are searching for the sounds.

Mr. Abbott briefed Chinese President Xi Jinping on the status of the search. Some two-thirds of the passengers onboard the flight were Chinese.

Pings consistent with a flight data recorder have been detected by an Australian ship that is using a U.S. naval device to detect black boxes.

Time is running out for authorities to locate the origin of the signals, since the batteries on the black box's locator beacon are set to run out after about 30 days.

The Malaysia Airlines jet, which was carrying 239 people, disappeared on March 8 while traveling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

Malaysian authorities believe the plane was deliberately diverted and crashed into the sea. But without wreckage, many are skeptical.

If authorities can locate more pings, they plan to deploy a robot submarine to search the ocean floor.

Once the black box is retrieved, authorities will be able to determine what happened to the plane. Its fate has become one of the most puzzling mysteries in aviation history.
