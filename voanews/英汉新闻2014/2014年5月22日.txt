**9-11纪念博物馆向公众开放**

纪念2001年9月11日纽约遭恐怖袭击的一个博物馆向公众开放。

新博物馆的开馆仪式以展开一面9-11旗帜结束。9月11日发生灾难的那天这旗子悬挂在世贸中心附近一座大楼外面。“纽约感谢你基金会”的迪特斯说，旗子是9-11事件两天后发现的。

迪特斯说： “它属于纽约，它是那可怕的日子的一部分，但也是重建美国努力的一部分。这就是纪念博物馆要向人们展示的。”

博物馆重点收藏了世贸双子塔倒塌的视频、人们跳楼的照片、近3000名遇难者的遗像以及被劫持客机上乘客的语音留言。

紧急无线电通话和遇难者往家里打电话的声音成了博物馆的背景音响，穿插其中的是幸存者用相对平稳的语调讲述灾难发生的情景。

来自首都华盛顿的参观者凡恩说，博物馆引起强大的感情反响。凡恩说：“博物馆让人情感震撼。爆炸声、跳楼的情景。这都是些活生生的画面，是我们生活的一部分。我不知道我是不是能承受这些。我的意思是，你会在博物馆里哭出来。我就哭了好几次。”

博物馆上星期首先对9-11事件遇难者家人、幸存者、救援人员开放，其中的4万2千多人参观了博物馆。

9/11 Museum Open to Public

A museum memorializing the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York has opened to the public.

The opening ceremony for the new museum was capped off by the unfurling of the 9/11 Flag, which was hanging from a building near the World Trade Center on the fateful day. Dennis Deters of the New York Says Thank You Foundation says it was found a couple of days later.

Deters said, "It belongs here in New York. It's part of the terrible day that happened but yet it's part of the rebuilding of America and I think that's what the museum is trying to show."

The museum features prominent videos of the twin towers collapsing, photos of people falling from them, portraits of nearly 3-thousand victims and voicemail messages from people in hijacked planes.

Ambient sounds of emergency radio transmissions and victims calling home are interspersed with the calmer tones of survivors recounting the day.

Todd Fine, a visitor from Washington D.C., says it evokes a powerful and emotional response. Fine said, "The museum is emotionally overwhelming. I mean its explosions, people jumping out of buildings, it's raw. It is part of our lives. I don't know if I am even prepared to deal with it. I mean, you're going to be crying in the museum. I cried on several occasions."

More than 42-thousand 9/11 victims' relatives, survivors, rescuers and recovery workers have already visited the museum, which opened to them last week.


**泰国军方完全控制国家否认政变**

泰国陆军司令巴育星期四晚上发表电视讲话说，军队控制了国家，目的是恢复秩序，推动政治改革。

此前，对立的政党间就目前危机已经进行了两天会谈。

巴育将军星期二宣布实行戒严，声称此举对防止暴力和结束持续一个月的政治僵局是必要的。

前总理英拉的反对者和支持者的会谈显然未能达成妥协。

泰国军方否认实行戒严相当于政变，但这一举措看来严重限制了临时政府的权力。

泰国最高法院这个月以滥用权力为由解除了英拉和几名内阁成员的职务，并任命了一个忠于他信的看守内阁总理，但是反对派抗议者要求政府集体下台。

在泰国6个月的抗议活动中，有近30人死亡。


Thai Military Takes Control of Country

Thailand's army chief says the military has taken over control of the country to help restore order and push through political reform.

General Prayuth Chan-Ocha made the announcement in a televised statement late Thursday.

The statement followed a second day of crisis talks Thursday with rival political parties.

General Prayuth declared martial law Tuesday, saying it was necessary to prevent violence and end a months-old political deadlock.

The talks apparently failed to achieve a compromise between the opposition and supporters of ex-Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.

The army had denied the martial law amounted to a coup, even though the move appeared to have severely limited the power of the interim government.

Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra and several cabinet members were ousted by the Supreme Court this month for abuse of power.

A caretaker prime minister loyal to Mr. Thaksin has been named, but opposition protesters are demanding the entire government step aside.

Nearly 30 people have been killed during six months of anti-government protests.
