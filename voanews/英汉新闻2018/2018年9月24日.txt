美中新一轮互征关税措施开始生效

美中之间针锋相对的互征关税措施于周一生效。

自华盛顿时间凌晨12点01分起，美国展开新一轮对价值2000亿美元的中国商品加征关税，北京则报复性地对价值600亿美元的美国商品征收关税。

美国的新关税涉及数千种中国制造的产品，包括电子产品、食品、工具和家庭用品。新关税从10％开始，之后在2019年1月1日升至25％。特朗普政府这次对许多其他商品豁免新关税，包括智能手表、蓝牙设备和婴儿汽车座椅等。

美国国务卿蓬佩奥周日在接受福克斯新闻采访时承诺，美国将在与中国的任何贸易战中取得胜利。他说， “我们将得到的结果是，迫使中国作出行动，让其如果要成为一个大国，一个全球大国......就不会窃取知识产权”。

但北京在双方互征关税生效几个小时后发布政策声明，指责华盛顿使用关税作为恐吓其他国家在经济问题上服从美国意愿的手段。

特朗普政府认为，对中国商品的关税将迫使中国以公平条件与美国进行贸易。

特朗普政府要求中国更好地保护美国的知识产权，结束利用网络盗窃的做法。白宫还呼吁中国给美国公司更多市场准入并削减中美贸易顺差。

美国已经开始对价值500亿美元的中国商品征收关税，中国也对等值的美国商品征收相同关税，以此作为报复。

本月早些时候，特朗普总统威胁如果中国对新一轮关税措施进行报复，就将对另外价值2670亿美元的中国商品加征关税，这将几乎涵盖所有中国进口到美国的商品。

US, China Exchange New Round of Tariffs in Trade War

Another set of tit-for-tat tariffs imposed by the United States and China on each other's goods took effect Monday.

A new round of U.S. imposed duties on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, and a retaliatory set of tariffs imposed by Beijing on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods, took effect at 12:01 a.m. Washington time.

The new U.S. duties covers thousands of Chinese-made products, including electronics, food, tools and housewares. The new tariffs begin at 10 percent, then will rise to 25 percent on January 1, 2019. The Trump administration exempted numerous other items from the new tariffs, including smart watches, Bluetooth devices, and infant car seats.

In an interview with Fox News Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo promised the United States will be victorious in any trade war with China. "We are going to get an outcome which forces China to behave in a way that if you want to be a power, a global power ... you do not steal intellectual property," Pompeo said.

But in a policy statement issued just hours after the dual tariffs took effect, Beijing accused Washington of using tariffs as a means of intimidating other countries to submit to U.S. wishes on economic matters.

The Trump administration has argued tariffs on Chinese goods would force China to trade on fair terms with the United States.

It has demanded that China better protect American intellectual property, including ending the practice of cyber theft. The Trump administration has also called on China to allow U.S. companies greater access to Chinese markets and to cut its U.S. trade surplus.

The U.S. has already imposed tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods, and China has retaliated on an equal amount on U.S. goods.

Earlier this month, President Donald Trump threatened more tariffs on Chinese goods if China retaliates. That's another $267 billion worth of duties that would cover virtually all the goods China imports to the United States.

联邦调查局报告2017年美国犯罪率下降

美国联邦调查局周一报告说，2017年美国暴力犯罪率下降，之前连续两年犯罪率上升导致特朗普政府实施严厉打击犯罪的政策。

联邦调查局在其年度犯罪情况报告中称，2017年每10万居民中发生大约383起暴力犯罪，比2016年下降约1％。杀人犯罪率从每10万居民的5.4%下降到每10万居民中有5.3%。

路易斯安那州连续29年来都是杀人犯罪率最高的州，每10万居民中平均有12.4起杀人案。在主要城市中，圣路易斯的杀人犯罪率最高，每10万居民中有66.1起杀人案。

暴力犯罪的下降趋势似乎一直延续到2018年。初步数据显示暴力犯罪案件整体下降近5％，杀人犯罪案下降超过6％。

美国司法部长塞申斯表示，暴力犯罪减少和谋杀率降低要归功于特朗普政府的政策。他说，“这是你支持依法治理得到的那种结果。”

FBI Reports US Violent Crime Rate Fell in 2017

Violent crime fell in the United States last year after rising for two consecutive years and leading to a revival of tough-on-crime policies by the Trump Administration, the FBI reported Monday.

In its annual crime report, the FBI said there were an estimated 383 violent crimes per 100,000 residents in 2017, a decline of about one percent compared with 2016 levels. The murder rate slipped to 5.3 murders per 100,000 residents from 5.4 murders per 100,000 residents the previous year.

The state of Louisiana recorded the highest murder rate for the 29th straight year, with 12.4 murders per 100,000 residents. Among major cities, St. Louis had the highest murder rate, recording 66.1 murders per 100,000 residents.

The decline in violent crime appears to have continued into 2018, with preliminary data showing overall violent crime down nearly five percent and murder down more than six percent.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions credited Trump administration policies with the lowering of the violent crime and murder rates.

“That is the kind of results you get when you support law enforcement,” Sessions said.
