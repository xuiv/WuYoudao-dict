美防长将视察美墨边界

美国国防部长马蒂斯周三前往美国南部边境，那里已部署了数千名美军，以支援边防巡逻人员。

马蒂斯星期二在五角大楼对记者说，目前“美军任务”“没有改变”。

他说，“我们正在布置边界隔离障，我们在那里有直升机，”他说，“我们要看未来会怎样，但现在这是我唯一的任务。”

美国总统特朗普呼吁加强边境安全，以防止寻求庇护的中美洲移民大军进入美国，并为此数次宣布这种来美方式带来“国家紧急状态”。

应国土安全部的请求，现有5,600名军人和另外2,100名国民警卫队队员已进入美国边境地区。

一名美国国防官员告诉美国之音，马蒂斯将视察德克萨斯州的麦卡伦，那里部署了大约1000名美军。

美国法律禁止被派往边境提供安全保障的美国军队参与国内执法，例如逮捕过境的移民等。

Mattis to Visit US Southern Border Wednesday

Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis is due to visit the U.S. southern border Wednesday, where thousands of American troops have been deployed to support border patrol agents.

Speaking to reporters Tuesday at the Pentagon, Mattis said there has been “no change” to the U.S. military mission “at this time.”

"We’re doing the obstacle emplacement, we do have helicopters down there,” he said. “We will have to see what the future holds, but right now that is the only mission I have.”

President Donald Trump called for increased border security to prevent a caravan of asylum-seeking migrants from Central America from entering the United States, declaring on several occasions its approach constituted a "national emergency."

More than 5,600 active duty troops and another 2,100 National Guard troops have moved into the U.S.-Mexico border area due to requests for help from the Department of Homeland Security.

A U.S. defense official told VOA Mattis will visit McAllen, Texas, where about 1,000 U.S. troops are deployed.

The U.S. troops assigned to help with border security are legally prohibited from engaging in domestic law enforcement, such as arresting migrants crossing the border.

美国最危险的地区在哪里？答案会让你惊讶

根据一个商业网站华尔街24/7的消息，阿拉斯加是全美最危险的州。

阿拉斯加在美国所有州中人口最少，但强奸案和暴力伤人案在全美的比例最高。 2017年，平均每10万居民中发生117起强奸案和575起暴力伤人事件。这两项数据都是全美平均统计数据的两倍多。

阿拉斯加去年的谋杀案件比率比上一年增加了20％。

新墨西哥州排在第2位。2017年，每10万新墨西哥州居民中就发生784起暴力犯罪时间，包括谋杀、强奸、抢劫和暴力伤人。这远高于全美平均每10万人中发生394起暴力事件的数据。

田纳西州的暴力伤人案数量几乎是全美的两倍，成为美国第三个最危险的州。该州的大多数暴力犯罪集中在城市地区，那里每10万居民的暴力犯罪率超过1000起。

根据这项研究，路易斯安那州和内华达州也进入最危险州的前5名。虽然2017年美国的暴力犯罪总体下降，但这些危险州的犯罪率实际上却上升了。

华尔街24/7网站在评估了联邦调查局、司法部和人口普查局的数据后得出这份报告。引用的数据来自人口至少为10,000的城市。

另一方面，报告指出，美国最安全的州是缅因州，每10万居民中有121起暴力犯罪事件。

被认为是美国危险最少的其他州包括佛蒙特州、新罕布什尔州、弗吉尼亚州和肯塔基州。

Most Dangerous US States Might Surprise You

Alaska is by far the most dangerous state in the nation, according to the business website 24/7 Wall Street.

The most sparsely populated of all U.S. states, Alaska has the highest rates of rape and aggravated assault in the nation. In 2017, there were 117 rapes and 575 aggravated assaults for every 100,000 residents. Both of those statistics are more than double the corresponding national rates.

Last year's murder rate in Alaska was up 20 percent over the previous year.

New Mexico comes in at No. 2. There were 784 violent crimes — murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault — for every 100,000 New Mexico residents in 2017. That is way above the national rate of 394 incidents per 100,000 people.

With aggravated assault numbers that are nearly double the national rate, Tennessee ranks as the nation's third most dangerous state. Most of the state's violent crime is concentrated in urban areas, where the violent crime rate is more than 1,000 incidents per 100,000 residents.

Louisiana and Nevada round out the top five most dangerous states, according to the study. While violent crime declined overall in the United States in 2017, the crime rate actually went up in some of the most dangerous states.

To reach its conclusions, 24/7 Wall Street assessed data from the FBI, Department of Justice and the Census Bureau. Only cities with populations of at least 10,000 were considered.

On the other end of the spectrum, the least dangerous state is Maine, according to the report, with 121 violent crimes per 100,000 residents.

Other states that were deemed the least dangerous in America include Vermont, New Hampshire, Virginia and Kentucky.
