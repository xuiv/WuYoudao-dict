美墨达成新贸易协定

美国总统川普说，美国和墨西哥已经达成了一项贸易协定，这使加拿大在修订或取代《北美自由贸易协定》(NAFTA)的努力中成了局外人。

川普周一在白宫发表讲话说，这项新协议将被称为《美墨贸易协定》。

川普在与墨西哥总统奥夫拉多尔通电话时对记者发表了讲话。川普称这对贸易和对国家来说都大日子。

川普总统说：“这对我们两国的制造商和农民以及所有为之工作的人来来说都是非常特别的。这也是一项伟大的贸易，它成为一个更公平的议案，我们非常非常兴奋。我们工作了很长时间，也很努力，你们的代表人员棒极了，我的代

表人员也棒极了。他们相处得很好，几个月来一直工作到深夜。这是一项极其复杂的议案，我认为在未来许多年里人们都会谈论它。”

墨西哥总统表示希望“延长、现代化和更新”《北美自由贸易协定》，而川普的言辞表明，他认为这项有24年历史的三国协议已经死了。

作为《北美自由贸易协定》的原始成员国，加拿大未参与这项新协议。川普说，美国将很快与加拿大开始谈判。

川普说，根据这项协议，墨西哥同意立即开始购买尽可能多的美国农产品。预计白宫还将在本周末正式通知国会行政当局计划在90天内签署一项新的贸易协定。

United States and Mexico have reached a trade agreement

U.S. President Donald Trump says the United States and Mexico have reached a trade agreement, leaving Canada as the odd man out in efforts to revise or replace the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

Speaking Monday from the White House, Trump said the new deal will be called the United States-Mexico Trade Agreement.

Trump spoke to reporters as he spoke on the telephone to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. Trump called it a big day for trade and a big day for the country. Trump said:"This is something that is very special for our manufacturers and for our farmers, from both countries, for all of the people that work for jobs. It is also great trade, and it makes it a much more fair bill, and we are very very excited about it. We have worked long and hard, your representatives have been terrific, my representatives have been fantastic too. They have gotten along very well, and they have worked late into the night for months. It is an extremely complex bill, and it is something that I think will be talked about for many years to come."

The Mexican leader expressed hope to “renew, modernize and update” NAFTA while Trump’s rhetoric indicated he sees that 24-year-old three-nation deal as dead.

Canada, an original member of NAFTA, is not part of this deal. Trump said the United States would start negotiating with Canada very shortly.

Trump said under the deal, Mexico has agreed to immediately begin purchasing as many U.S. agricultural products as possible. The White House is also expected to formally notify Congress by the end of this week of its intention to sign a new trade agreement within 90 days.
