Russia's Putin Sworn In for Fourth Term

Vladimir Putin, who has been either president or prime minister of Russia since 1999, was sworn in for a fourth term as president Monday at the Grand Kremlin Palace's ornately-decorated Andreyevsky Hall. Putin said, "I consider it my duty and my life's aim to do everything possible for Russia, for its present and for its future."

He will not be able to run for a fifth term as president unless there is a change to Russia's constitution which prohibits more than two consecutive terms.

Putin annexed Crimea from Ukraine during his most recent term and also partnered with Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad for a military campaign in Syria.

Reports: Singapore Likely Site of US-North Korea Summit

South Korean news outlets say the anticipated summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will likely take place next month in Singapore.

The Chosun Ilbo newspaper and the Yonhap news agency are quoting unnamed sources that the U.S. and North Korea have agreed the meeting will take place in the city-state in the third week of June, to avoid conflicts with the Group of Seven (G-7) summit to be held in Canada on June 8-9, which Trump will attend.

Trump told reporters Friday that the two sides "now have a date and we have a location." He has previously said the Demilitarized Zone that divides the Koreas might be a good venue.
