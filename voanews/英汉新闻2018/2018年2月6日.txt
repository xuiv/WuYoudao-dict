Misery on US Stock Market Spreads to Asia Tuesday

Asia's benchmark stock indexes collapsed Tuesday, as Monday's massive selloffs on Wall Street rolled across the globe.

Japan's Nikkei 225 index lost as much seven percent of its value at one point during the trading session, before closing at 21,610 points, a loss of nearly five percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index followed suit, dropping just over five percent in its worst trading day since August 2015.

The benchmark indexes Australia and South Korea also suffered serious losses.

In early Europe trading London's FTSE 100 was down 3.5 percent at 7,081 points.

Asian markets were caught in the ripple effect of Monday's 1,175-point loss on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, marking the biggest point decline in history. The S&P (Standard and Poor's) 500 also had a bad day, losing just over four percent to finish at 2,648 points.

The stock market has now lost about a trillion dollars in value since Friday, when the Dow lost 666 points. That drop followed a solid jobs report that showed the U.S. economy adding 200 thousand jobs and wages rising at the fastest pace in a decade. The tighter labor market and rising wages prompted investor fears of higher inflation and the possibility that the U.S. Federal Reserve would raise interest rates faster and higher than they have in recent years.

德国称朝鲜通过驻柏林大使馆购买核设备

德国情报机构负责人说，朝鲜一直通过其驻柏林大使馆获得开发核武器项目所需的设备和技术。

德国联邦宪法保卫局负责人马森对德国公共电视台NDR说，德国当局怀疑黑市上的掮客购买零部件，朝鲜驻德国大使馆再从他们手中购买。

马森没有具体说朝鲜购买了什么设备，但是说很可能是军民两用技术。

德国公共电视台报道，朝鲜在2016年和2017年进行了购买行动，但是一名朝鲜外交官在2014年曾试图购买一台生产化学武器所需要的监视器。

朝鲜驻德国大使馆发言人否认这项消息，对美国的有线电视新闻网说，消息根本不真实。

Germany says N. Korea Got Nuclear Equipment through Its Berlin Embassy

North Korea has been getting equipment and technology for its nuclear weapons program through its embassy in Berlin, Germany's intelligence chief says.

BfV head Han-Georg Maassen told German public television NDR that German authorities suspect underground markets and shadow buyers got their hands on the parts and the North Koreans procured them in Germany.

He did not say exactly what equipment the North Koreans bought, but said it is likely duel-use technology, meaning it has civilian and military purposes.

The German TV report says the North carried out its activities in Germany in 2016 and 2017, but that a North Korean diplomat tried to buy a monitor used in chemical weapons production as early as 2014.

A North Korean embassy spokesman denies the report, telling CNN it is "simply not true."
