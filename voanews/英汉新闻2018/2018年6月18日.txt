奥迪首席执行官因排放丑闻调查被逮捕

德国当局星期一逮捕了大众汽车集团旗下的奥迪首席执行官鲁伯特·施塔德勒。他的被捕是对奥迪在欧洲销售汽车进行调查的一部分。据信，这些汽车上安装了在实际驾驶时可以关闭排放控制的软件。

上星期，慕尼黑检察官以涉嫌欺诈和文件处理不当为由，突袭搜查了施塔德勒的住处。

大众奥迪说，“无罪推定仍然适用于施塔德勒”。奥迪已经承认在美国排放测试中作弊。

大众汽车前执行长马丁·文德恩在美国受到指控，但是他不太可能应对这些指控，因为德国不会将其国民引渡到欧盟以外的国家。

Audi CEO Arrested In Emissions Scandal Probe

German authorities have arrested the chief executive of Volkswagen's Audi division, Rupert Stadler.

He was arrested Monday as part of an investigation about cars Audi sold in Europe that are believed to have been equipped with software that turned emissions controls off during regular driving.

Last week, Munich prosecutors raided Stadler's home on suspicion of fraud and improprieties of documents.

Volkswagen Audi said "the presumption of innocence remains in place for Mr. Stadler."

Volkswagen has pleaded guilty to emissions test cheating in the United States.

CEO Martin Winterkorn was charged in the United States, but he will unlikely face those charges since Germany does not extradite its nationals to countries outside the European Union.

联合国权利主管抨击美国政策造成家庭分离

联合国人权事务高级专员扎伊德·拉阿德·侯赛因星期一呼吁美国停止其“不合情理的”政策，说该政策强迫让非正常从墨西哥进入美国的未成年人与他们的移民父母分离。

侯赛因说，这项政策已经在过去6个星期影响了近2000名儿童。任何国家通过对儿童实施这种虐待来寻求遏制他们的父母移民，是“不合情理的”。

这是即将于8月卸任的联合国人权事务高级专员星期一在人权委员会定期会议上最后一次发言。

UN Rights Chief Blasts US Policy of Family Separation

The U.N. human rights chief is urging the Trump administration to end new policies separating migrant children from their parents after entering the United States from Mexico, saying they’ve affected nearly 2,000 kids in the last six weeks.

Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein says it’s “unconscionable” that any country would seek to deter parents from migrating “by inflicting such abuse on children.”

He spoke at Monday’s opening of a regular Human Rights Council session, his last before his term ends in August.
