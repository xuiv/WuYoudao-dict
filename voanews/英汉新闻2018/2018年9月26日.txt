安理会讨论伊朗及大规模杀伤性武器问题

联合国大会周三继续举行年度会议，伊拉克、也门、阿富汗、古巴和英国领导人将发表讲话。联合国安理会则在场外会晤，讨论伊朗在中东的影响以及围绕不扩散大规模毁灭性武器的有关问题。

安理会的会议将由美国总统特朗普主持。他周二在联大发表讲话时呼吁世界各国领导人“只要伊朗侵略行径不改，就孤立其政权”。

特朗普总统周二表示，“他们（伊朗）不尊重他们的邻国或邻国的国界，或这些国家的主权。相反，伊朗领导人掠夺国家资源，中饱私囊，并在中东和远在中东之外的地区带来混乱。”

特朗普总统坚持认为，他将美国撤出的2015年为停止伊朗核项目而签署的协议是“伊朗领导人的意外横财”，让他们提高军事预算近40％，用来“资助恐怖主义，为在叙利亚和也门制造混乱和屠杀提供资金。“

特朗普总统说，他的政府上个月开始“对伊朗重新实施在核协议下取消的严厉制裁”，并将在11月5日及以后实施更多制裁。

伊朗总统鲁哈尼在联大讲话时说，任何国家都不能以武力被迫来到谈判桌。鲁哈尼还质疑伊朗如何能与美国达成协议，他说这违反了特朗普的前任奥巴马的政策。鲁哈尼还指责特朗普政府试图让所有全球机构失去功效。

自从特朗普总统一年前在联合国首次亮相以来，他严守“美国优先”的政策，削减了对联合国的资助，退出了巴黎气候协议和伊朗核协议，退出了包括人权理事会在内的联合国机构。

UN Security Council to Discuss Iran, Weapons of Mass Destruction

The United Nations General Assembly continues its annual meeting Wednesday with addresses by leaders from Iraq, Yemen, Afghanistan, Cuba and Britain, while the U.N. Security Council meets on the sidelines to discuss, among other things, Iran's influence in the Middle East and issues surrounding the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

The meeting will be chaired by U.S. President Donald Trump, who called on world leaders during his address before the Assembly on Tuesday to "isolate Iran's regime as long as its aggression continues."

"They do not respect their neighbors or their borders or the sovereign rights of nations. Instead, Iran's leaders plunder the nation's resources to enrich themselves and to spread mayhem across the Middle East and far beyond," President Trump said Tuesday.

Trump maintained that the 2015 nuclear deal to end Iran's nuclear weapons program, which he withdrew the United States from, was a "windfall for Iran's leaders" and boosted its military budget by nearly 40-percent to "finance terrorism and fund havoc and slaughter in Syria and Yemen."

The president said his administration started last month "reimposing hard-hitting nuclear sanctions that have been lifted under the Iran deal" and that more sanctions would be imposed on November 5 and beyond.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told the Assembly in his speech that no country can be brought to the negotiating table by force. Rouhani also questioned how Iran can enter into an agreement with the United States, which he said violates the policies of Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama. In addition, Rouhani accused the Trump administration of trying to render all global institutions ineffectual.

In the year since he made his U.N. debut, Trump has faithfully followed his America First policy by cutting funding to the world organization, withdrawn from the Paris Climate Agreement and the Iran nuclear deal, and quit U.N. bodies, including the Human Rights Council.

美国务院提议减少来非洲、中东国家难民比例

美国国务院的数据显示，国务院提议缩减未来一年接收来自非洲和中东的难民人数比例，增加来自亚洲、欧洲、拉丁美洲和加勒比地区的难民人数比例。

这一根据区域进行的转变是提案的一部分，该提案将2019财年允许进入美国的难民人数减少到30,000人，创下最低纪录。

目前，国务院的数据显示拟接收的每个地区难民人数为：

非洲 - 11,000人，低于2018财年的19,000人；

近东和南亚（包括中东）- 9,000人，低于2018年的17,500人；

东亚 - 4,000人，低于2018年的5,000人；

欧洲 - 3,000人，高于2018年的2,000人；

拉丁美洲和加勒比地区 - 3,000人，高于2018年的1,500人。

提议的上限是人数额度，而非目标。根据美国国务院的数据，在本财政年度还剩下大约一周的时间里，提议的45,000名难民额度中有不到22,000人被允许进入美国。

此外，难民人数的地区分配并不总是与现实相符。例如，特朗普总统去年要求42％的难民来自非洲。而截至9月21日，这个比例为46％。

另一个超出其预定比例的地区是欧洲，由于乌克兰难民激增，原定欧洲4％的额度大幅上升到现实中的16％。

去年来自中东的难民比例差异是最明显的。美国政府原将比例限制在39％，也就是总计45,000个难民名额中允许有17,500名来自中东的难民。但到目前为止，2018财年只接收了3,756名中东难民，占比17％。

US Refugee Proposal Would See Decrease for Africa, Middle East Countries

The U.S. State Department is proposing that the United States receive proportionally fewer refugees from Africa and the Middle East in the coming year than it planned to last year, in favor of an increase in refugees from Asia and Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, according to data obtained from the agency.

The regional shifts are part of a proposal that would reduce the number of refugees allowed into the country for Fiscal Year 2019 to 30,000, a record low for the program.

As it stands, the proposed amounts for each region, according to the State Department, are:

Africa — 11,000, down from 19,000 in fiscal 2018.

Near East and South Asia (includes the Middle East) — 9,000, down from 17,500.

East Asia — 4,000, down from 5,000.

Europe — 3,000, up from 2,000.

Latin America and the Caribbean — 3,000, up from 1,500.

The proposed ceiling marks an upper threshold — not a goal. With about a week left in the fiscal year, fewer than 22,000 of a proposed 45,000 refugees had been admitted into the country, according to State Department data.

Moreover, regional allocations don't always align with reality. For example, last year, the president mandated that 42 percent of refugees come from Africa. As of Sept. 21, that figure was 46 percent.

Another region that exceeded its intended allocation: Europe, where a surge in Ukrainian refugees accounted for part of the jump from a proposed 4 percent of refugees to a reality of 16 percent.

The difference in refugee arrivals from the Middle East in the last year was the starkest. The administration capped the number at 39 percent — 17,500 Middle Eastern refugees of the 45,000 total; to date for FY2018, it has admitted 3,756 from the Middle East, or about 17 percent.
