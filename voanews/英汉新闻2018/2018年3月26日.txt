埃及星期一大选投票

埃及星期一开始投票。广泛认为，塞西总统将赢得连任，再担任4年埃及总统。

塞西只有一位对手。穆萨在参选之前是塞西的支持者。

其他几位候选人或者被逮捕、或者在压力下退出选举。在野政党呼吁抵制这次选举。

埃及这次投票为期3天，正式结果将于4月2号公布。

由于塞西预计将稳获胜利，人们把注意力放在参加投票的人数。

塞西推翻穆尔西总统之后，于2013年执掌权力，在2014年的选举中赢得了97%的选票。但是当时由于选民投票率过低，选举官员决定把投票时间延长一天。最后的选民投票率不到50%。

Egyptians Vote in Presidential Election

Egypt began voting Monday in an election widely assumed to give President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi another four-year term in office.

Sissi has a single challenger, Moussa Mustafa Moussa, who had backed Sissi before joining the race.

A number of other candidates were either arrested or pressured to withdraw, and opposition parties have called for a boycott of the vote.

The election lasts three days with official results expected April 2.

With Sissi expected to win attention is focused on the number of people who turn out to cast ballots in the election.

He came to power in 2013 by ousting President Mohamed Morsi, and then won a 2014 election with 97 percent of the vote. But election officials extended voting in that election by an extra day amid low turnout with final participation figures coming in under 50 percent.
